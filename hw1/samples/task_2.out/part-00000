a common misconception that oo techniques be applied in most can just that they are slightly more unwieldy than in languages with syntax dedicated to the of the foundations of robust system design is the encapsulation of an implementation behind an and the functions that work with it is a good example of how encapsulation can be applied in c to establish since c lacks access specifiers you enforce that peeks inside a but only a masochist would do polymorphic behaviour can be had in c using tables of function the syntax is ugly but the effect is the same as virtual ianimal int int relying on guaranteed of memory layouts cat struct ianimal int struct x pa calls	
a computer scientist and a web programmer and i would suggest you learn both http and made really made really the titles of the above tutorials they made the concepts for got cgi and http down suggest checking out following sites that provide a wealth of articles and references for web developer you want to concentrate on writing web then python and ruby are all fine choices myself use perl and suggest doing some research into the popular web frameworks available for each pick something simple as your first web a form and a page that shows the results of submitting that some good examples cgi can be found a perl5 cgi see the first set of links on this you want to start writing web apps that use a read up on sql and popular in your chosen language for database especially orm interfaces that allow you to deal with records in an luck with being a web programmer is fun because your audience is teh

a deployment with a process that deploys one at a time and the rest of the system keeps working mufaka this is a tried process that will work with both content files and any compiled piece of the application deploy causes a recycle of the the of this is something you can have the updates go through a and have a single deployment process that controls when to deploy each notice this mean you process each update as you can grab the current updates in the queue and deploy them further updates will arrive to the and will be picked up once the current set of updates is about the questions in the this is a custom solution based on my experience with processes which needs their rate of updates i had the need to use this approach for deployment as for such dynamic content i usually go with a combination of db and cache at different queue need to hold the full it just need to have the appropriate info that will let your process pass the info to start the publishing process with an external as it is custom you can have it join the information to be so you have to deal with that in the publishing db changes would be done during the publishing again you just need to know where the info for the required changes is and let the publishing handle regarding what to use for the the main ones i have used is msmq and a custom implementation with info in sql the queue is just there to control the rate of the so you need anything specially targeted at make sure your db changes are backwards this is really when you are pushing changes live to different

a i have bought into the tdd philosophy and take the effort to make extensive unit tests for any nontrivial code i sometimes this road can be painful changes causing cascading multiple unit test high amounts of scaffolding but on the whole i refuse to program without tests that i can run after every and my code is much less buggy as a been playing with and resident testing in a fashion distinctly different from quickcheck has an emphasis on testing invariants of the that certain properties that hold over all substantive of a quick a stable sorting algorithm should give the same answer if we run it should have increasing should be a permutation of the quickcheck generates a variety of random data in order to test these seems to at least for pure functions functions without side if you do mocking correctly you can convert dirty functions into pure that invariant testing could supplant unit testing as a strict superset of those each unit test consists of an input and an output imperative programming the is not just the return of the function but also any changed but this can be one could conceivably created a random input generator that is good enough to cover all of the unit test inputs that you would have manually created then because it would it would generate cases that you have thought if you find a bug in your program due to some boundary you improve your random input generator so that it generates that case is whether or not possible to formulate useful invariants for every say it a lot simpler once you have an answer to see if correct than it is to calculate the answer in the first thinking about invariants also helps clarify the specification of a complex algorithm much better than ad hoc test which encourage a kind of thinking of the you could use a previous version of your program as a model or a version of a program in another you could cover all of your former without having to explicitly code an input or an i gone or am i on to invariant testing replace unit	
a indexes perform but gist indexes are more you want indexes if work for your data there was a recent post on the pg lists about a huge performance hit for using gist expected to be slower than is the price of but not much work as you might post by tom a core postgresql main point of gist is to be able to index queries that simply not indexable in one would expect btree to beat out gist for i think significant point here is that winning by a factor of a pretty and might point to some

a line of code in language that line is written once and likely to be read many more times potentially of so proficiency in a language in large reading for a corpus of programs written in how quickly can you read the programs and understand what they are of the available i think since there is an arbitrary number of commonly used libraries that are created while you are learning even the libraries for many languages today have thousands of distinct concepts and tens of thousands of how the features of the language are a property of a given implementation of the language rather than the language but i think it does knowing that regular expressions are often implemented as state machines knowing the theory for is pretty relevant to understanding of regular expression though knowing how java byte code works has never had any relevance in java applications worked i guess some languages have a cleaner separation from their possible implementations than this may be a key difference between high and low level you have a particular language in a good test is to look at serious examples in for the case of reading the linux gnu os postgresql or and out how they is not only an indication but can be good there was that one assignment about static analysis of but the actual solution could have been written in

a pretty good overview of how such structures might compile on the x86 are ways to sometimes avoid a branch often has strongly negative performance implications due to pipeline for example the i686 instruction set onwards from pentium pro to the current has a conditional move instruction which might compile something like no as long as your compiler is set up to target it feels like compilers are complex and is conditional old arm programmers get to specify any instruction which cuts down on branches a

a project i need to develop an app in adobe i choose for the now the project is quite and contains a login and a details i would like to do is on app launch show and if that was succesfull question is if there is some quick and dirty way to save some of the info i received from the login as in a briefly looked into their but what i saw there is that although there are multiple they actually keep the open all the and load the childpages into the thus saving session data in in my eyes it creates kind of a and would rather have every page take care of itself which will make it a bit easier to adobe air for js support some sort of data	
a python programmer who has had a taste of ruby likes i think there is somewhat of an ironic parallel to when python was beginning to become and java programmers would stating that it a real and that the dynamic nature of its types would be and allow people to create as python became more and the advantages of its rapid development time became not to mention the less verbose p new began to see some more dynamic features appear in later versions of autoboxing and make it less troublesome to deal with and generics allow us to code once and apply it to many was with some amusement that i saw one of the key flexible features of ruby monkey being touted as dangerous by the python having started teaching ruby to students this i think that being able to the implementation of an existing even one that is part of the is very you can screw up badly and your program can i can segfault in c pretty and java apps can die flaming truth i see monkey patching as the next step in dynamic and since it has been around since

a trick you can do where you open the device handle requesting neither read nor write permission and interact with it using only feature mentions this trick in her books about usb hid i believe this gets around the problem with the exclusive which you would encounter when trying to open a handle to a device that windows considers a system keyboard or even though you read or write the you can still send a feature report to the device using and read a report from the device using i know offhand of a way to read input reports or send output reports under these and perhaps impossible to do but you might not need either of especially if the device is device in the sense that you control the strictly speaking this does nothing to answer your question as but it seemed potentially relevant so i figured throw it out

a user logs into the and says we get the unique identifier for the encrypt this with rijndaelmanaged with a keysize of 256 and place this in a httponly cookie with a set expiration of 120 the expiration is refreshed each successful request to the we generate the initialization vector based upon the user agent and part of the ipv4 address last two theres no real expiration system built into the user could technically use this encrypted key forever we change the server side considered the fact that to allow this feature i need to allow the user to be able to bypass the login and give me their unique id is a i figured the guid alone was really hard to guess a real users but would leave the site open to attack by botnots generating guids no idea how realistic it is for them to find a legit so this is why theres encryption where the server knows the encryption and optionally the iv is specific to the browser and ip i be considering a different approach where the server issues tickets associated to a and these tickets would have a known expiration date so the server stays in control of should i really care about remember me is remember me after forward to being humbled this a reasonable way to implement

about to decide how to handle internationalisation of an format for ui format typically looks something like for this and temperature file contains lots of screens and can be up to some and we have a dozen of these files in our can still change the format to best suit our so how would you go about translating been thinking about some possible ways to handle separate file for each language containing the english text and translated an id for each tag and use a separate file with translated text for each all translations in the same first solution has the problem where the english text might be translated into different messages depending on second solution makes the source file less readable not by and it does not handle translation of attributes third solution would make the file very large and cumbersome to work with once the file has been translated into some of xml	
above answers claim on compiler optimization the code given all the documentation and experience i have had in embedded systems dsp i know for a fact that turning on optimization will increase your code size for ti dsp chip me ti tmscx6416 dsp has 9 compiler flags that will affect your code different flags for different flags for different flags for code my when you turn on optimization level three the documentation for certain functions will occur will increase code pipelining is enabled will increase code is software is where the compiler will do things in assembly that make the for loops execute significantly faster up to a couple times faster but at the cost of greater code i suggest reading about pipelining at look for loop and epilog check your documentation to make sure the optimization making your code suggestion is to look for compiler flags that relate to code you have code size compiler make sure to crank up them up to the highest usually compiling for code size means your code will execute but you may have to do boyd

all of the code in classic text the c programming second edition can be compiled using a standard compilers like gcc if your c code is upto the standards followed in that classic then good enough ready to compile your c code using a the instance of linux kernel source code which is mostly written in c with some inline assembler a nightmare compiling the linux kernel code with a because of least possible reason that is being used as an variable name in linux kernel where as allow the usage of as a variable i am just giving one example remember that linux kernel is portable compiles runs very well in sparc etc this is just to illustrate that portability does have different meanings in software if you want to compile c code using a you are migrating your code base from c to i see it as two different programming languages for most obvious reason that c programmers like but i like both of them i use both of them a your c code is but you should make sure you follow standard techniques to have your code portable while you migrate your c code to read on to see from where get the standard have to be very careful porting the c code to code the next question that ask why would you bother to do that if some piece of c code is portable running well without any i accept again linux kernel a big code source in c is being managed very see the two programming languages c as different programming though does support c its basic notion is to always support for that wonderful language for backward if not looking at these two languages as different then you fall under the land of ugly programming language wars make yourself the following rules when choosing does your code or need to be compiled on different architectures possibly using native do a study of compilers on the different architectures that you wish to run your program plan for code invest good time on as far as possible try to provide a clean layer of separation between c code if your c code is you just need to write wrappers around that portable c code again using portable coding to some good books on how to write portable i personally recommend the programming language by bjarne stroustrup effective series from scott meyers popular ddj articles out there in linux kernel example in my post is just to illustrate that portability does mean different meanings in software programming criticize that linux kernel is written in c not in	
all the advances in 3d graphic it strikes me as odd that the same level of attention been given to modern games do rendering of 3d yet we still get audio accompanying those if you will a 3d engine that models not just the physical appearance of but also their audio and from these models it can dynamically generate audio based on the materials that come into their distance from your virtual when crouching behind the sandbags with bullets flying over your each one will yield a unique and realistic obvious application of such a technology would be but sure there are many other such a technology being actively does anyone know of any projects that attempt to achieve audio

am reading the problem as server gets messages from client 1 and 2 and forwards clients are different meaning the messages they are sending could potentially be what you want is the messages from the clients to be sent alteratively out from your but not to if a client has this i suggest that you have two queues and in your will have to read from the sockets in two seperate and when a message comes in add it to its corresponding client1queue client2queue in a third have the server forward the alternating pulling these messages from client1queue and solve your problem of if the queue is empty simply skip that this insures sending all messages at the fastest possible rate while still getting all the messages the downside is that it only alternates if a message is ready to be you of have it wait for x amount to see if a message comes for the other but i see why you would want to if the system is supposed to work regardless of the client

am working on a program in that needs to load some javascript parse it and do some processing to the found in the code as overwrite them with something problem is that having a difficult time devising an elegant way to actually find the string literals in the javascript code in the first example take a look at the sample javascript code do you see how even stack code highliter is able to pick out string literals in the and make them red in want to basically do the same except i will not be turning them into a different but i will do some processing on them and possibly replace it with an entirely different string dp sh utils brushes strings version aboutdialog alex all right expandcode expand viewplain print copytoclipboard to about copiedtoclipboard code is in your clipboard test blah blah test blah blah test blah blah sdfdff asdfasdasd fasdf have tried parsing through looking for but it gets complicated when you have escape characters in the string the other solution i was thinking is to use a but i am not strong enough with regular expressions and not even sure if that is the avenue i should be would like to see what stack oveflow thanks a to string literals from javascript source	
am working on a program which produces assembler code from one of the functions required is which currently works using the following sequence of code addresses are filled in at run i would like to use the opcode so i tried using the following test program uses printf to show the result stored at but for the second sequence the result is displayed as first using cos and sin works if i try examining the value at the memory or on top of the floating point in the it appears as the correct my question why is printf showing and how can i fix value at 0x00c01288 is double precision result in both cases is first thought was that the value being stored was a different representation of the same but inspecting the value stored at 0x0030fa8c shows it to be 0x3fe17b4f5bf3474a in both do not understand why identical inputs to the printf function could produce different help or suggestions would be greatly source where printf is unsigned int sc double a unsigned int ch return is printf showing for fptan

am working on a typical data entry system in most of my screens are basically i am using a ddd approach and have domain objects for a typical scenario is something like a user object with a user edit and entry working on this for a few types of i am seeing a i am creating a view that does nothing but binds to the domain each view has a similar look with a header to the domain and some edit controls based on the data type of the view box for lots of text instead of creating a separate view for each i could create some sort of generic view class that auto generates a form based on the object in the i could somehow tell the view what order to place the fields name is on then then and also give some attributes to the fields as setting name as a header which will be shown in bold or to this sounds similar to what you do with then to change the look of the entire i just have to change the view or the template for the here are my this approach make sense and would it there anything like this what would be the best way to do form

and serialization are synonymous in the context of remote procedure but semantically different as a matter of marshaling is about getting parameters from here to while serialization is about copying structured data to or from a primitive form such as a byte in this serialization is one means to perform usually implementing is also possible for an object to be marshaled by in which case the data the is simply location information for the original such an object may still be amenable to value there may be additional metadata such as code base location or even object implementation

answer below feel like initializing variables to their default values should not be it is redundant and add much any value to the find that most people who do this have a strong background in and consequently have it ingrained into their mind that you must initialize member variables in order to write correct code am guilty as such this practice just translated over to where it is not actually not something i lose a lot of sleep if people default initialize their variables i may add a nitpick comment in the code review but i really take a hard stance on

answer to another for some more examples of rtsj the latest version is compliant with so you should have it is feasible to write a gui to execute within the same jvm as not clear that this is a good architectural it is more likely that prefer to isolate the behaviors in a jvm and provide a separable interface that implements to gui in a separate memory you are supposed to be able to write rtsj code such that it runs in the same jvm with threads i have done a lot of but it can be tough to get synchronization

answer your last two by no memory leaks in managed there are two kinds of leaks that can are released when no references to the object are if you still have a reference to an it will not be this happens for instance when you throw away a reference to an object that has registered for an event if you manually unregister the event handler use a weak the event will still reference the so it will not be released although you have no obvious reference to it resources can be a wrapper for unmanaged resources implements idisposable and will free the resource when you call if you just throw away the it will not release the resource and therefore leak two rules of thumb any event handler when you release an or use a weak reference for that on explained a class exposes a dispose call if you use the object only use the using if you have members that implement implement idisposable yourself and call the dispose in your

appears that the poster is seeking a evolution which produces something similar to the observed agree that it would be extremely unlikely to produce a replica of the observed earth even something superficially by applying an evolutionary model with stochastic i believe impossible to produce something similar by employing an evolutionary model with event in since it actually there should be some set of events that could be added to the simulation that corresponded to the initial random event which produces the exact i think this sort of thing is still well beyond us computationally i think it will be for this would be an interesting way to attempt to find approximate answers to questions regarding gaps in historical it would essentially be a computational way to produce concrete testable it might not even be too different from the way we do it inside our

application delegate is not an application it should inherit from not that is a its method always returns the first nsapplication or any throwing away any subsequent objects you the nib may be calling you ended up setting your application object as its own the object you intended to make the delegate died in the second call to and the application object took its the application object to be an instance of your subclass would also have but still have the application as its own which is unclean and possibly dangerous may privately implement some of its delegate methods as just notification handler the only correct solution is to make your app delegate class not inherit from	
approach is to adopt a push model rather than a pull typically you need different formatters because breaking and have something truckxmlformatter implements vehiclexmlformatter public void format vehicle truck truck pulling data from the specific type into the create a data sink and invert the flow so the specific type pushes data to the sink truck implements vehicle public datasink inspect datasink out if begin returns boolean to let the sink ignore this allowing for cyclic return means still got the data and just feeding tagged data to the an xml sink might then ignore certain parts of the maybe reorder some of and write the it could even delegate to different sink strategy but the sink necessarily need to care about the type of the only how to represent the data in some using interned global ids rather than inline strings helps keep the computation cost down matters if writing or other tight

are 2 main approaches to building an rcp app you are using rcp just for the platform features the application code will be isolated from rcp conventions and libraries as much as possible for the actual app biz your app is completely immersed in you try to reuse rcp wherever possible have tried out option in this the experience is very similar to java you might want to try this option the advantages are swt is very well integrated into you dont need to run into hoops to get it i would recommend swt over swing any day as it is very easy for an average programmer to create a responsive and swt app while it takes a swing expert to create a decent swing app with a client the ability to is very eclipse automatically offers this stuff you still need to learn how the eclipse classloader this is to ensure you can explicitly load resources from your jars in the correct way it is not you will need to package the jvm along with the and invoke the jvm on startup using relative naming

are currently implementing the full recovery model from the sound of this will allow you to restore to a point in time provided that you have a transaction log backup that covers the desired point in time full order to reduce the size of your required transaction log you should look to increase the frequency of your transaction log i would suggest once you have gauged the actual usage of your log you can then look to shrink it to a more suitable the key point to note here is that once a transaction log backup has been the inactive portion of the log file becomes available for use once the reason why a transaction log file grows continuously is if the transaction log backups are not being taken at all or their frequency is not would also suggest that you consider performing a mix of differential and full backups in order to reduce the collective size of your backed up an example schedule would be a weekly full say every with daily differential hope what i have detailed makes please feel free to contact me directly and i will happily assist you in deploying an appropriate backup strategy for your to stop the transaction from growing and restoring databases sql

are facing a initialization the easiest way out is implemeting a singleton so that you can control the initialization as you are using multithreaded the singleton will have to be the check pattern for and probably a mutex and a condition to avoid race check your threading library documentation for documentation on this the general pseudo code would would be in your two last while wait for image image res already wake up producer is return image image while wait for image to be wake up consumer if it is threading library probably has better constructs for mutex acquisition and but the idea is that you have a single point where the two threads wait for the other to complete their tasks so that there is no thread	
are fantastic if doing just plain i just google and find things for the most	
are four basic this is the least maintainable but easiest to i personally consider use of to be a element at the top of the this is slightly better than because it keeps the markup however it wastes bandwidth and makes it harder to make sweeping css because you look at the and know what rules this lets you have the clean html clean main css it means your client must download lots of little css which increases bandwidth and page loading it very easy to big the main advantage of one big file is that only one thing to this is much more efficient in terms of bandwidth and you have any programming going you might be able to just dynamically combine multiple sheets from to get the effect of would recommend one big whether you actually maintain it as one file or generate the file through a build process or dynamically on the you can specify your selectors using ids include just in for the that was accepted when i wrote i disagree with finding a of classes that gives you the result you this sounds to me like the classes are identifying a visual style instead of a logical your classes should be something like and not then if you need to change the text colour on the user info you can say h1 color start applying classes all over the place because a class currently has a certain appearance that you you should put concepts into your represented by html with and then style those not the other way

asked a yesterday about comparing ranges for overlap and its been stuck in my throat ever consensus seems to be that my preferred answer which involves using the array intersection operator is inefficient because comparing arrays is wonder why this feature is in the could it be that the language creators believed that sometimes you need an elegant way to achieve a solution even if expensive to do is comparing arrays so costly that you should avoid it whenever the whole attraction of ruby for me is the focus on syntactic elegance over premature if the array intersection operator is why is it

believe missed on some basic idea behind starts with reusable units of with an emphasis on creating the case of the rtf memo it meets the above criteria by handling a given set of data in such a way that your program and other objects within your program care how it does purpose is to show an accept manipulate that specific and pass that data on to another part of your idea behind being is simply that you can replace that memo control with another control which meets the same interface that you can instantiate let the user interact with and pull the data out when loosely coupled goes hand in hand with the idea of of which is the process of breaking a program into distinct features in order to reduce overlapping functionality and make easier to but they are not the same this was also one of the main drivers behind moving away from the procedural style of programming into as oop forces the programming to think in terms of related and discrete sounds like you are really asking about are many ways to achieve sometimes it involves keeping the processing and persistance layers separated the mvc design pattern for sometimes it is simply keeping related functions together in order to reduce which the rtf control already does by containing all of the functions necessary to manipulate the data so that you have further hope that

best thing to do for handling errors in your program is the because simple tasks are the least likely to services are most definitely the they add several more layers of technology and custom code that can application should at the very least write error messages with any important information about the error to a log so you can find out what next simplest step would be to send a simple indicating that the program had an with any useful email address and smtp server you need to successfully send the message should be in the configuration information for the you still want to add sending your error information to a web service after logging and fine at least you will have a log and message about any web services failures you

boils down to the fact that the compilation phase has lesser information to work with and hence the runtime needs to do more work in case of duck typed if i am making the method invocation in case of java or the invocation to bar can be optimized in the compilation process by discovering the type of and then directly invoking the method at the memory location where the compiler knows it will be since a python or any other dynamically typed language compiler does not know what type the object foo belongs it has to do a type check at runtime and then look up the address of the bar method and then invoke are other difficulties a python compiler writer struggles with as though the one above hopefully adequately gives an so even with the best compiler statically typed languages are likely to perform much better at dynamically typed languages score are typically in the development due to fewer lines of code to write and and no compile wait times for the development often goes through much

cerberus is not supported in javascript you need to get rid of that and use something to keep in mind is that there is no standard for regular expression it is different in each so testing in something that uses the regular expression engine is not a valid test of how it will work in try and look for a reference on javascript regular such as match that looks for characters is also this will ensure that there are at least 8 but it does not limit the string to since the character class with the at the end can match as many characters as what you want instead is to replace the at the end with the and eliminate it from the re the other not really sure why you would want to restrict the length of unless a hard database limit there since you be storing passwords in plain text in the but instead hashing them down to something fixed size using a secure hash algorithm with a and as i see a reason to be so restrictive on the set of characters you recommend something more like re why would you forbid l and o from your passwords it looks like trying to forbid i as which you forgot to this will make it very hard for people to construct good and since you never see a password as you type no reason to worry about letters which look confusingly if you want to have a more permissive re

consist on hiding a base class method with a new definition in a child difference between hiding and overriding has to do with the way methods are when a virtual method is the call address for the method call table of the base class is replaced with the address of the child the other when a method is a new address is added to the method call table of the child a call is made to the method in method call table class type is if we are invoking with a reference to the base class then the base class method table is if we have a reference to the child then the child class method table is method is searched in the if found then the invocation takes otherwise the base class method table is we invoke the method with a reference to the child class then the behavior is the if the method has been the method address will be found in the base if the method was hidden the method address will be found on the child and since it has been already base class table will not be we invoke the method with a reference to the base class then behavior when as the method address overwrites base class we will call the child even when holding a reference to the base with the base class method table is the only one visible as we hold a reference to the base contains the virtual method and the base class method will be general shadowing is a bad as it introduces a difference on the behavior of an instance depending on the reference we have to

current language design philosophy is that nullability should be something a programmer is forced to ask not given by default on reference types i agree with tony hoare google for his recent qcon this specific with the unnullable it even pass static conservative analysis cannot guarantee that b2 so the program is not semantically ethos is simple references are an indirection handle to some which we can traverse to obtain access to that nullable references are an indirection handle to a a notification that the resource is not and one is never sure up front which semantics are being this gives either a multitude of checks up front it or the inevitable npe most programming resources these not massively resource constrained or bound to some finite underlying model null references one just bung a null in which i have too much sympathy know what to put in here typically also a legacy of older where you had to declare your resource names before you knew what your resources went a better error reporting mechanisms are thus essential in a know have something give me a this has more and we can think of ways to combat solving each of the cases that null current caters for with a better linguistic choice is no small and may add more confusion that it we can always go to immutable so null in only useful states and much real imperative technqiues are here to stay and frankly glad this makes the search for better solutions in this space

deciding what dimensions to make a i usually consult major high traffic sites like usually decent indicators of what an acceptable layout dimension right google news has a layout which autosizes to but has a minimum width of has a fixed layout of you may want to do your own survey of but the site working on at the moment has an 800px fixed it is a reasonable dimension for displaying the type of content we are and it will not alienate a dimensions should be specified in or relative to the no reason to define the width of your layout according to the height of a just because a bigger font size is used does not mean the screen resolution is automatically unless you are working with fonts where you can define the number of characters on each row of there much point in making your layout dimensions proportional to type text will automatically wrap around the column width i use frameworks like yui or jquery to shorten development these frameworks also largely conceal inconsistencies between different jquery masks inconsistencies in ecma scripting implementations between different yui largely does the same but also provides advanced ui components and css resets that work across most major beyond i no longer worry about supporting browsers like layout seems pretty if you understand how to build layouts and separate presentation from then you should be is the current w3c i think xhtml is supported by any major browsers ie still does not even fully support xhtml so it is best to write css1 is fully supported by most major while css2 is planning to launch a separate version of the site with a format specially tailored to mobile as tvanfosson mobile users will likely be interested in different content from desktop things like and other images will have to be removed or scaled navigation interfaces and website flow will have to be altered as

do you see as the advantages and disadvantages of amazon web services s3 compared with google application the cost per gigabyte for the two at the time i roughly i have not seen any widespread complaints about the quality of so i think the decision of which one to use may depend on the api all api breaks your content into what they call such as your css etc and http requests for static stuff will be served to whoever requests it until your bandwidth limit is requests will be fulfilled until your bandwidth or cpu limit is with respect to your you can provide any logic you are able to express in so you can be choosy about who you api treats all your content as blobs in a and provides an access protocol that lets you distinguish between a variety of fulfillable requests ranging from to if you want to something not in the i know what you do beyond being thoughtful about distributing your differences do you see between the are there other cloud storage services you had a press release but looking for a minimum of ten terabytes on the beta and none of my clients are there and will probably do something in the near advantages of storage using amazon web services s3 vs google application

doubt you will have any hard data on so i will add some thoughts on you use di other solid because it helps you do its the other way you do tdd because it helps you with the design which usually means you get code that follow those why to use interfaces is a different will assume you agree that having your classes do many different things results in messy i am assuming you are already going for you have different classes that do specific you need a way to relate if you relate them inside the classes the you get plenty of code that uses specific versions of the this means that making changes to the system will be are going to need to change the a fact of software you can call yagni about not adding specific extra but not on that you be needing to change the in my case something really important as i do weekly use a di framework where configuration is done through with a really small code you hook up lots of different when you take away the discussion on interface concrete you are actually saving typing not the other way also for the cases a concrete class is on the it hooks it up automatically have to building the rest of the it also allows me to control some objects life in particular i can configure an object to be a singleton and it hands a single instance all the note that just using these practices more using them for the first is what causes the overhead of the learning process in some cases mind set you gonna need to put all those constructor calls all over the place to go

edited i initially criticised the problem description as my problems stem from way the concept of a is used in the the question implies the programs and tracks are all stored in one i thought the questioner was building his own which would make this in one structure but i have now decided probably not doing in which case less so go ahead and offer a real based on the assumption using an existing file and his entire data structure is stored in one file within that file if i am assuming wrong no doubt be will first offer one piece of general advice for situations like look at things from the perspective of the api user then design your api so that the code he will write flows easily with no need to deal with the details that are properly in your way to work on your api design is to write some user code first and define the api so that that code is easy to as a after you actually implement the api then have some test code to try it out on to more specific is a catalog of the three data types in the we can treat them as abstract data types or if you like and define a struct track to represent each a collection of programs stored in a a collection of a collection of audio would propose that you make your users pick out data from the you really hide the internals of the structures in c jumping through hoops with casting but you can provde a family of functions that your users do what they need to do without accessing the contents of the abstract types for example our family of functions might look like disc const char int file disc program disc const char disc int int program track program const char program int unsigned char int unsigned long offset track should all be reasonably self explanantory it is modelled on the existing standard c file your user obtains a ptr to disc with assuming this works will return null if it he can obtain any global disc information with more to the point he can obtain a ptr to a progam within the disc with one of the family of a ptr to program he can drill down further and obtain a single track with one of the family of very important point is that you make your user iterate through the audio fragments himself to get data from the the user provides a buffer to read the samples and you iterate as necessary through the fragments to fill that the function is provided to give him random tried to work out the details of every parameter and how errors are handled i am just presenting a concept to be that the paradigm is used an introductory and a concluding sandwiches operations on every

far as i you have two choices for floating point exception handling in c and if you floating point exceptions most environments do by you can see whether any floating point exceptions have occurred by calling fetestexcept available in visual but you can steal the mingw implementation easily in the public once an exception has been not cleared until you call so you can call fetestexcept at the end of a series of calculations to see if any of them raised an this give you the traps that you asked but it does let you test if problems like nan or have occurred and react as you can floating point exceptions by calling in linux or in how the operating system handles a floating point exception depends on your operating the os sends a sigfpe so you can install a signal handler to catch that and set a flag that tells your routine to react the os invokes structured exception handling to convert the processor exception into a language exception that you can catch using a block in c or block in for mac os as described in you should be able to exceptions using from and as long as you use the default compiler options disable you should be able to catch exceptions using written a bit more on this and other floating point issues in c and in blog if

general rule of thumb here is that server roundtrips are expensive to how long a typical query so the guiding principle is that you want to minimize basically each join will potentially multiply your result set so the way i approach this is to keep joining until the result set gets too large or the query execution time gets too long seconds on your platform you may or may not be able to execute queries in this is a key determinant in what you should do because if you can only execute one query at a time the barrier to breaking up a query is that much worth keeping certain relatively constant data in memory for or doing them as a separately query but this in my reasonably more common is having to fix up systems with awful performance due in large part to doing separate queries correlated instead of

going to answer part of this question and it yes this can be you have two options on approaching the region can try to fit your window management into the region you would essentially have to write a region adapter for the docking library you would like to infragistics actually provides a cal region adapter for their docking library that you could take a look at different way of doing it is to create a service that provides an interface for modules to use to show register the service it with your unity container and every module can call this is a more flexible way to go since regions out of the box have a concept of it is true that this means that you will be skipping out on the region but it is a trade off of flexibility vs regards to the your shell window will just contain a ribbon control which either all modules have access to or you wrap a service around it so that all modules interact with it through your own interface this

had once a situation where i had to override the event handler in some derived class of i could not unfortunately just it since the implementation logic was bound strictly to that particular method implementation in the base natural idea was to first the original event handler from the event and then to bind my own so i tried to use the operator new eventhandler which point the compiler complainer that it had no access to the private method since the base class was a part of the library i did not really want to modify its implementation simply as it seems by just turning into so simple to attach an event handler to an why is it so difficult to get rid of i wanted because the base implementation was casing some problems did not handle our particular so i wanted to redefine but even after i attached my event handler the base implementation was getting executed since it was doing some kind of my own implementation was never going to run since the request processing was being broken at server after there anyway to get rid of an event handler in a base class from a library without modifying its to an event handler attached to an event in the base class when in a derived

has a limit of 10mb each on static files uploaded through right at the bottom of obviously you can write code to slice large files into bits and reassemble at download but it suggests to me that google expect app engine to be used just as a simple and that if you want to use it as one have to do some s3 does the job out of the all you have to do is grab a interface you want to do something with file access on then probably amazon expects you to spring for a server instance on once this is you have much more flexibility than but you pay more cash and probably in plus point for gae is that it has on its side for small apps to 1gb 1gb bandwidth and million hits a day are depending on your this might be or it might be irrelevant on the scale of your total bandwidth i have just this last couple of days looked at gae for the first i took an old perl cgi script and turned it into a gae which is up and about 10 hours including reading the gae introductory docs and remembering how python is supposed to work enough to write a couple of hundred speculate more effort than loading a bunch of files onto but less effort than maintaining ec2 i used to this sounds like the advantages are all with amazon for commercial this may well be but then gae is not yet mature and presumably will get better from here fairly they only let people start paying in december or before that it was except by special arrangement with while google sometimes takes flack for its claims of i think gae genuinely is still starting if your app is a good fit for the bigtable data then it might scale better on gae than for storage i assume that s3 is already good enough for all reasonable and clever architecture gives gae no advantages to compensate when all doing is serving except that google has just offered me a preview of java just noticed that you can set up chron but limited by the same rules as any other request second modify

have a cobol exe program which calls a cobol dll which in turn calls a cobol program using a dos interrupt the calling program uses an to activate an exe file as if it were typed in as an operating system command line the security program which wraps my cobol code is a third party program which wraps around my the author has suggested that my program read environment variables to insure that the security has not been i have been unable to get my cobol to read the so i thought that writing the program in the variables could be all the present program does is create a small sequential write one record to it and close the file for i have the program wrapped by third party security and it generates the variables i want to verify to allow the progam to write the record weith the contents of the security check as passed or not the calling program cobol then tests for the presence of the reads the record and validates whether the code for security has been written into the cobol program needs to be translated to because the author of the security wrapping code says he interface with cobol present program is small it does is create a small sequential flat text write one record to and then write the record and close the program needs to check for the presence and value of certain variables being generated by a security program which wraps around the little program generating the and runs while the wrapped program is the variable returns the name of the current license thanks for any author of the security software has been unable to provide a small executable to check his so i am looking to create one from scratch which will emulate little cobol program i have been referring to the environment variables of the security program wrapping and securing my little create a write one record to the contents of which depend on the environment and then close in this the calling dll will receive the file written by the small program executed by call to the operating system one which needs to be coded in instead of the present verify its and either allow the main program to procede or the main software consists of over 500 programs which i have ported from mainframe legacy code to i used to use dongles but my clients hated them as they interferred with their dos call which activates the new little wrapped program will work with any executable program so it really is not an simple cobol program needs to be recoded as a program to read environment variables passed by wrapping security

have worked on several rails applications that experienced high load due to viral growth on mongrel count should be based on several if your mongrels make api calls or deliver email and must wait for then you should run as many as try to maintain one mongrel per cpu with maybe a couple extra left sure your server is using a fair proxy balancer round here is the nginx module that does here are some other tips on improving and benchmarking your application performance to handle the most common problem rails applications face is poor usage of activerecord it can be quite easy to make of queries when only one is the easiest way to determine if this could be a problem with your application is to set up after making a request to each major page on your take a look at the newrelic sql if you see a large number of very similar queries sequentially from posts where id select from posts where id select from this may be a sign that you need to use a in one of your activerecord other basic activerecord tips are just the ones i can think of off the top of my not doing it make sure to correctly use indexes on your database making database calls in especially it can be very easy to lose track of how much you are making database queries in push all queries and calculations into your models or making queries in usually this can be done by using an having rails build activerecord objects for large datasets as much as when you make a call like a new class is instantiated for every post in your database it could be a large query in this case you would want to use which will make a single fast query and return an integer without instantiating any like create both a and the latter skips instantiation of activerecord objects and can be much especially when dealing with large numbers of objects this is a good way to speed things and use whenever it will help you keep your code tiny and makes it much easier to have efficient apis much as you do not make api calls to external services while handling a your server will stop executing code until a response is not only will this add to load but your mongrel will not be able to handle new you absolutely must make external calls during a you will need to run as many mongrels as possible since you may run into a situation where many of them are waiting for an api response and not doing anything is a very common problem when building facebook same applies to sending emails in some if you expect many users to sign up in a short period of be sure to benchmark the time it takes for actionmailer to deliver a if not almost instantaneous then you should consider storing emails in your database an using a separate script to deliver like have been created to solve this a good guide on the different methods of caching in performance you suspect a method may be try benchmarking it in an track of methods that are slow in your those are the ones you want to avoid executing in some cases only the first call will be slow since rails has a query you can also cache the method yourself using will also provide a nice overview of how long methods and sql calls take to

i always did i written an upload script for link up an upload script upload to a simple offers some you do not offer your users direct insight to your file system if there is a leak in your and you expose your whole can store extra information and in an easy and efficient can actually query for files instead of just looping through all the can enable a where you delete the but keep the file can enable logging way more files in pages is can using a database enables you to store a and a there are some disadvantages as it is a little harder to since your file system and database have to be in if an operation fails one of both you have either a database or file mentioned before we can not mention your uploading mime type extension issue is one that is going on for i think most of the web is solid but there used to be a time when developers would check either mime type or but never both this resulted in websites being very not written upload scripts are big hole in your a great example of that is a website i a while back their of they supported the upload of images to a but they only checked on file so i uploaded a with a directory scanner this allowed me to scan through their whole system it a dedicated i could see a little more then i helped

i propose a somewhat unorthodox would you think about placing the column after the rather than at the very this avoid the requirement for only a portion of the table to not exactly what asking but perhaps it is a sufficient given that the alternative would be pretty the and columns outside of the for would create alignment problems when not all rows are of equal you could correct this with javascript but then be entering a whole new world of from a ui it may be that and are the most important in which case it would make sense to put them followed by a sort of of the of we seem to have an intuition that a should come after its constituent but i think it would cause too much confusion to the user if the order were reversed like this this is a question for based on your product and your something to are some more unorthodox now that i think i understand your intentions a bit the give the most recent and the link to older which are provided 10 at a time give and some other meaningful as mean and then link for each name that results corresponding to you could then also link showing all results for score so that comparisons between different users be the point is that have to give 1 dimension for each rather an unwieldy 2d data the rows sortable with jquery so that if i want mary to i can drag one after the so i to keep scrolling left to see which scores which a row when it is by changing the or again so i need to keep scrolling left and you get the perhaps it is better to look for a ui solution than a contorted markup ultimately i would be questioning how important it is to present so much data to the user at that a portion of it needs to scroll in a particular fashion for the data to be perhaps building a spreadsheet and you really do need to display a 100x100 matrix in a single if you could surely come up with more creative ways than i have to split up the

i think probably not considering the use of messaging an mom instance or any other mom on a case really make sense best to think of your mom broker as a router of that you would have one activemq broker instance might be sharded or otherwise scaled if you have scaling or replicated if you have ha which all producers and all consumers connect then all xml goes to the same broker and all consumers read from the same broker in that the broker will determine which consumer the message should go to based on any heuristics it also means that you can add and remove producers and consumers and nothing ever they all connect to the same so you can add and remove producers and consumers as your load changes or as systems

i work for a company that makes performance management and capacity a lot of products out there to answer those quest makes a like spotlight for sql spotlight for capacity manager for sql and so no single formula or rule of thumb because each component in the system reacts differently to and each thing storing scales if storing sales data in a data your sales data will grow pretty a simple formula per per you first open your the transactions per day is fairly but as word spreads about your the transactions per day if you start carrying more items amazon going from books to your items per transaction may rise as well but not over as your reporting needs implement aggregate tables to include data about your etc and change the amount of data you store as the other if building a web filtering the formula revolves around the number of employees each company people will surf roughly the same amount over but the formula is affected by whether going to hire more people or lay people you nail down a formula to predict your data that formula necessarily useful to your cpu needs or your bandwidth a each capacity planning product has its own sets of for has something like half a dozen different formulas just to predict disk and not even talking about cpu or memory in a big find that different formulas work better for different types of found that more efficient to buy a product that has all these formulas built in rather than reinvent the wheel to become an expert in predictive i expect me to say that because i work for a but i bought capacity manager as a dba before i came to work for

imply a lot of linux file systems delay writes and batch them which improves overall presumably reduces wear on the disk and improves battery life for if the os had to write to disk whenever a file many of these benefits would be tomblin mentioned a controversy in his and explaining the one seen fit into a what recent controversy is over the ext4 ordering is the proposed successor to the popular ext3 linux file it is in linux and unix to change important files by reading the old writing out the new one with a different and renaming the new one to the old the idea is to ensure that either the new one or the old one will be even if the system fails at some ext4 appears to be happy to read the old rename the new one to the old and write the new which can be a real problem if the system goes down between steps 2 and standard way to deal with this is of course but that trashes the real solution is to modify ext4 to keep the ext3 where it rename a file until it had finished writing it apparently this covered by the so a quality of implementation and qoi is really lousy there being no way to reliably write a new version of configuration files without constantly calling with all the problems that or risking losing both	
important distinction between valuetypes and reference types is that value types have these a int32 and all other value types have no an int32 is essentially indistinguishable from any other int32 with the same value type exist either on stack or as a part of a reference type one special case is when you cast a value type instance to an object or an interface this is called and it simply creates a dummy object which only contains the value that can be extracted back on the other have an a does not equal any other because they are separate instances on the gc some reference types provide equals method and overloaded operators so that they behave more a string equals other string even if they are in fact two different when you have a it can either contain the address of a valid or it can be when value type objects are they are simply an integer a float boolean or if you need to distinguish between and you need to use either a separate boolean better use the class in which is simply the value plus a boolean also support in the clr so that boxing of a nullable with results in a null not in a boxed structure with as it would if you were to implement this structure

in this example you look you see that only the used for when representing this in an oo you end up with a class i would call a maybe in maybe in another query an object that can return a rowid based on some property and value of that real behavioral change would be in the query so if you are to create an abstract class or an it should serve that the concern of variation in property and value can be separated by adding a argument to the query

index range scan is pretty usually a lot less data in the index than in the table and a much better chance that the index is already in blame you for wanting to save round trips to the server by putting each of the ids your looking for in a if the index range scan really worries you can create a parameterized server side cursor in that takes the customerid as a stop as soon as you find a that query should definitely use an index unique scan instead of a range	
inferencing is a bit of a compromise found in some static you can declare variables without specifying the provided that the type can be inferred compile it offer the flexibility of latent but you do get type safety and you have to write as wikipedia	
insertion order must is any data structure so avoid or data or trees for then you use one of those but then you have to keep track of its insertion order in each must be unique database objects that are identified by a a unique identifier associated with each if this is a c then the pointer to that node is unique guess this applies in java as if the pointer is not sufficient to maintain then you need to add a field to each node which you gaurantee to have a unique if a newer object with the same is the older version of object should be do you want to place the do you want to the existing or do you want to delete the old then add the new one to the this is important because it is related to your requirement where the order of insertion must be the solution should be by many only way i can think of to do this is to implement some sort of java lets you wrap strucutres and code within an when the first object added to structure is it should removed from the data like a like an arraylist is a pretty good option for simply because of the only problem is that searches are but if you have a relatively small amount of then it really that much of a like others have a hashmap or even a tree of some sort would work but that will depend on the frequency of if the element is most likely to be use a linear but if accesses will be of go with a hashmap or	
int can be treated as a and in pointers can be incremented and point after that to the next and as pointers can be compared then pointers can be used as are requirements for iterators pointed in the standard and pointers meet here is some of iterators i support the as a regular pointer to an guarantees that there is a value pointing past the last of the so for any iterator there is an iterator value that past the last element of corresponding

interfaces lend themselves to readability as long as the method names are chosen that in like to nominate this particular api as a member of and takes an and returns true if the object is an instance of the you naturally tend to read it from left to right like actually the other but not all methods could possibly be named positioned in the to anticipate how they might appear in so this really a just pointing out another aspect of fluent interfaces the choosing of method names in order to cause the least many of the examples given the only reason a fluent interface is being used is so that several properties of a newly allocated object can be initialized within a single has a language feature that very often makes this unnecessary object initializer myobj new someproperty another complain str perhaps would explain why expert users are less familiar with the term for chaining calls on the same object it needed quite so often in properties can have this is an opportunity to call several methods on the newly constructed without having to make each method return the same limitations property setter can only accept one property setter cannot be would like it if we could call methods and enlist in as well as assign to inside an object initializer myobj new someproperty another complain str click why should such a block of modifications only be applicable immediately after we could someproperty another complain str click would be a new keyword that operates on an object of some type and produces the same object and type note that this would be an not a so it would exactly capture the idea of chaining in a you could use syntax regardless of whether got the object from a expression or from an ioc or factory fact you could use after a complete and it would be equivalent to the current style of object myobj new someproperty another complain str click as charlie points out in the static t t if return above wrapper simply forces a action to return and hey presto anything can be in that of but with event myobj new on a factory method instead of a myobj resist giving it the check for null as so if you have something that might return you can still apply to it and then check it for

is a lot of room between the bare metal and you have said you writing an os but not whether or not you are running under an directly on hardware without an you will still want to encapsulate all of your operations in a even if you formally define a device driver interface and framework for all of your modules to this is hugely architecture and makes you responsible for knowing all of the details of interaction with every device you might ever for some this can quickly become a huge development that a problem for embedded but running on commercial hardware this way is neither easy nor within an you probably get want to access to the actual hardware registers and if you are developing a custom the best practice is to make it conform to existing standards so that you need as little low level custom software for it as this is why you see a lot of custom user interface gadgets connecting via usb and identifying themselves as hids interface as a the existing usb drivers take care of the physical and the hid driver takes care of the logical providing a very simple high level access api to the of the operating key roles is to provide a consistent api across all that takes the form of and functions names but some form of at least the first four will always the os layer is quite an os call is forwarded without much processing to a device which then forwards the data on to the the os low level calls block the caller until they and often they have restrictions on the sizes of the buffers that make for raw access to a disk device is usually required to be for an integral number of disk blocks at a forget about things like file systems and network all of which are made much more reliable and compatible by encapsulation within an operating if it is acceptable to call and for single that is usually not the best performance operating system calls are relatively and if you can read multiple characters in a single your performance can go way is the origin of the stdio library for and various other buffering libraries in other the stdio library provides a buffering layer that isolates the c code from the block size of the underlying even on an entirely operating system where you have full control over all the something like c stdio will still be your own stdio replacement is a highly valuable even if you use it in production and is one i would recommend to anyone wanting to learn about what really goes on between and and the terminal or valuable resource is the book standard c by in the author presents an implementation of the complete c runtime library specified in the ansi his discussion of the specific implementation choices he made is valuable and apropos to the context of this and the discussions of why some of the standard library features were specified is interesting as	
is a means of that loosening the connections between two you want that because it makes your code neater and easier to pretty much the goal of all design easier to easier to maintain this you have two two publisher and publisher is a class that actually does some then it every so often will call methods on any observers to tell them about it knows which classes to call because it keeps a list of observers who your publisher might look something like observers new o in really does most of the all the observer needs to do is get added to the list and implement the called like public public stuff is a pretty barebones idea of how it why is that looks pretty well coupled up one reason for that is because i use an which would allow me to set up many classes with observer and publisher need never know anything more about them except that they can receive an also note that publisher will attempt to call alert on any and all observers it even if it has in the the language has a built in version of this pattern through event events are very powerful and make use of which is a way of passing a method as a parameter in another method they allow for some serious but save that for a new

is a quite common situation in our applications that some entity have to be represented by an for example and things like there are conditions or flows in the code that use the values to decide between one action or so the values have to be in some way for the application it has to be able to refer to a specific instance to decide instead of referencing the class in a that is why we use enums instead of just a regular problem is that these entities also need to be stored at least in the as fields of other we usually create a table for each to be capable of having referencial integrity checks in these and also that the data have a in the database alone without the need to refer to the enum to find out what each id the data for these entities should be populated from the data in the but nowadays we have the values duplicated in the db initialization becomes a bit more complicated when an orm like hibernate is like to know how other people handles this kind of not fully comfortable with the idea of having a duplication between an enum and a database but i found a better solution to handle duplication between java enum and database

is a school of thought out there that says you should never expose your surrogate to the outside so say if you want a business you should use something else for wikipedia for says values of generated surrogate because they are generated and arbitrary have no relationship the meaning of the held in a when inspecting row holding a foreign key reference a surrogate it is not possible work out the meaning of it that reference simply by looking the data in the row a layer added to this indirection for foreign key join that one navigate while attempting to sense of a data this can make auditing more incorrect data is not obvious keys are also not for data that is exported and a particular difficulty is that instances of a schema can hold which logically mean the same is they are the same in business but which have different key owing to the history how the keys were approach to dealing with this is adopt the rule that surrogate keys never exported or they never exposed outside the except as transient data in executing that have a connection to	
is a simple but the answer can be really really les try to narrow down the scenario with some the os is you have a relatively large number of writes that are truly can skip the by simply issuing the writes them all at once let the os schedule the matter if the writes are to the same file or to different this is only true if the above assumption about the writes being independent is this be any slower than a single plain old every day disk on a parallel ata it will be the os can schedule the writes very this would be true in the case of a storage system with lots of or with a disk that supports key thing to remember here is that disk cpu so going out of your way to use help it will just make life you can help things if you order the writes so they are sequential in a file or sequential on the disk by sorting them by their

its been a few years since done anything with java servlets here so going from would expect the thread safety problem here is in the check for when looking at threading issues the thing one must understand is that a thread can be interrupted between any two machine instructions just any line of that is to that not threadsafe i is shared as i 1 is two an and a the thread can get interrupted between the add and the store and only one of the adds will same thing is occuring in this suppose for a two threads make a request on the same session as goetz suggests from frames or ajax one enters this code successfully retrieves the then attempts to get the since it does not yet null is the thread is then interrupted by another request which does the same it also gets the two requests then proceed in any since both retreived a null reference for the attribute since the cart had not been stored at that both threads will create a new cart object and both will try to store one will loose and those changes to the cart will be thus this code is not for the second half of your i am not familiar with the atomicreference i quickly looked over the java api for atomicreference and it might but not in any the most obvious solution i can think of here is to use a basically what looking to do is have mutual exclusion on the portion of your provided your cart object is atomic we only need to protect the getting and setting of i think something like this could syncronized shoppingcart shoppingcart cart if cart new return session cart i know much about the performance of java monitors so not sure what kind of overhead this would this would have to be the only location where cart is the syncronized keyword means that only one thread can enter the method atomicgetcart at a a lock is used to enforce this lock is simply an object that can be owned by only one thread at a this way you no longer have the race condition that was in the other this	
java and avoid separate they make full use of they differ is that they require the programmer to write a pair of separate files when writing a reusable the user writes the definition of a class and the compiler extracts the information equivalent to the from that single definition and includes it in the output file as so the output file full of files in or an assembly in is a combination of binaries and headers in a single when another class is compiled and it depends on the first it can look at the metadata instead of having to find a separate include happens that they target a virtual machine rather than a specific chip but a separate they could put x86 machine code in as the binary and still have the metadata in the same file as well is in fact an option in albeit rarely compilers it is common to try to speed up compilation by using the metadata in and files is much like a header already parsed and ready for rapid upshot is that in these modern there is one way of doing and it has the characteristics of a perfectly organised and modular build system pretty speaking

let me say there are no hard and fast rules this is my understanding of ddd and repository but a fairly subjective from a ddd perspective what you might want to do when adding an answer to an existing question is something like the following style new var question you are using an orm that handles change tracking and that is configured to cascade child objects back to the database that is all you would need to do thinking of nhibernate but other orms can work in a similar by adding the answer to the question you have told the orm that you want the answer to be persisted in the database when the unit of work you typically call not a very way of approaching things where answer is in the same aggregate as question and question is the aggregate getting the objects out of the typically you would ask the repository for a question object id and then navigate to the answer from there an answers collection on the question answer in or do something useful this seems like a strange way to save or retrieve the answer object then you might want to whether answer does actually belong in the same or whether it would be better to break it out of the question aggregate

mainly not a question of how to make service and communication protocol is not the main issue with wcf you can expose your application methods via spectre of merely a question of application question here is how do you like to implement if your application is normal windows then it have just because service should not have so need separate gui is standalone application that somehow communicates with your say via in this case plugins should also be implemented in two plugin for service and plugin for i it would be too complex to of 1st both service and gui are packed in one it looks in what mode started or and either monitors mail or shows since this is one the configuration is also the so you will have single registry for i that in gui mode application will search for started service and configure drawback gui could be run only make a sort of gui service sends gui to simple which shows in this case you have one place for all app code and but executed in part in in part in client but you also need such universal client a little more about variant 3 we see that solution already exists it is web it would be simplest to implement your service as part a web and gui would be another if you are unfamiliar with html and javascript you can implement gui using you can host right in your is the good but i afraid it adds unnecessary

me a while to track down this error but i finally found out i am modeling a card game using the rails currently my database looks like games id the rails activerecord and currently look like card game i attempt to run a game and there are multiple games than i get the in duplicate entry for key insert into values time the action cardid i has something with how rails inserts the data into the since there is no cardsgames i think it is just pulling into id and inserting it into the this works fine until you have two games with the same which violates the primary key constraint on being affluent with my first solution to this problem was to try to force rails to follow a definition of this relationship by dropping id and making cardid and gameid a primary it work because the migration seem to handle having two primary keys the rails api saying that its okay to do another solution for this is to omit the column in the insert into statement and let the database handle the auto i know how to do this is there another for is there some nifty rails trick that i just or is this sort of structure not possible in this is really frustrating because i what is wrong and i several ways to fix it but due to the constraints of the rail i just cannot do key issues in

method most sites use for this is to have a script on your site handle the so instead of the link being directly link goes to something script logs the request and then forwards them to the address should be done give them a you to website b in 3 that as a to your i much prefer a method where the destination is apparent when i hover over the as opposed to the method that some sites use where all you see is an what i mean instead of the link being something instead have a link the destination can be achieved in a few one way is something like i described where the destination is part of the query you can use some javascript for the status value can be changed with javascript by setting the but many browsers prevent this by default for has found a sneaky way around this problem by actually using javascript to change the instead of the status when the page is the links in the results list go to their actual but every link has an javascript event that changes the link when you click on you can see this in action by on a after done hovering over the link will now show the true destination in the status bar instead of the real course the information displayed with any method could be a misrepresentation of where actually going to be but i still prefer it over seeing a meaningless id

most common solution is to have an activity you can assume that an active user will make at least one request within amount of time say 5 minutes or can enforce this by putting an async request triggered off a timer that starts when the page for if assuming that all active users will make at least 1 request every then each page will request an empty page every that as long as they have the browser window always have activity from that this is handled by asynchronous not by any sort of reload this makes it absolutely transparent to the an added see if you can make that ajax request pull down some useful rather than just enforcing licensing	
most important thing is to understand why the choice was made and use the team to determine if this is something that you would want to team buying is important for these kind of decisions and the team is more than just the source control trees contain things such as so there is a legitimate chance that the structure was determined by multiple parties to find a common use tfs where i as we do have a common root folder called control that is the main folder that all team projects live this choice was made because of the extreme by all that the drive would get cluttered with various you have the option to map multiple so what you do on your local machine is dictated by the structure on the my personal and my as is to use a single workspace mapping to the source control given the shelving functionality in there is not a concern about having multiple copies checked since they can be shelved if something else needs to be worked build server has the same as this in no matches the deployment builds are dropped based upon the criteria of the the only time this presents a problem is when absolute paths are in configuration for since we are not using absolute paths definition in our developer this is a

much easier to make it more modular you really unittest something with a whole lot of when to refactor is a tricky you really have to weigh the costs and risks vs the is this code something that will be reused or is this code really not going to if you plan to continue to get use out of then you probably want to like you want to you need to start by breaking out the simplest utilities and build on you have your c module that does a gazillion for some code in there that is always formatting strings a certain maybe this can be brought out to be a utility got your new string formatting made the code more its already an you are asserting that you are in a catch 22 you really just by moving things made the code more readable and you can create a unittest for this broken out you can do that a couple of you can make a separate app that just includes your code and runs a bunch of cases in a main routine on your pc or maybe define a static function called that will execute all the test cases and return if they this could be run on the you go with this but its a and it may make you see other things that can be easily broken out into testable

my design the ui this is for our as a complex ui will almost immediately alienate potential we prototype our designs on then as we decide on specifics for the prepare the view and any appropriate controller code for continuous interactive prototyping of our we move towards an acceptable we then write a spec for the workflow logic of the paper is and churning through designs guarantees that at least spent a small amount of time thinking about the implementation rather than coding specs are kept in revision control along with our if we decide on a or want to we branch the and immediately update the spec to detail what trying to accomplish with this particular unit tests for branches are not they are required for anything we want to incorporate back into found this encourages are not nor are they owned by any particular by committing the spec to the democratic environment of source we encourage constant experimentation and revision as long as it is documented so we saying a recent iphone game yet we ended up with almost 500 which later translated into nearly 20 different a huge number of concept simplifications to on the progress bar instead of a separate a number of rejected and 3 new the great thing is and every was so it was easy to visualize how the idea could change the each major build in trunk gets with unit tests we try to have at least 2 people test out the we try to find people who have little knowledge of as found far too easy to design complexity rather than use doxygen to generate our we really have auto generation incorporated into our build process but we are working on do not code if the unit test and the source cause probably ok but this is because we are able to rely on the quality of our this probably would not work in all testing has been a for our programming since any new code can not be passed into trunk without appropriate unit we have fairly good coverage with our and moderate coverage in our it is no substitute for user testing only a tool to aid in getting to that bug we use we like but it works for we will probably soon either roll our own solution or migrate to our goal is to not release software until we reach a 0 known bugs because of this our updates to our existing code packages are usually fairly our flow usually looks something like ui spec planning code unit tests 1 or controller model spec planning 2 or controller code unit tests 3 or idea spec coding unit idea spec coding unit unit tests 2 or bugs bug tracker bug repair 2 or product bug reports 2 or process is not perfect by any but a perfect process would also imply perfect humans and technology and not going to happen anytime the amount of paper we go through in planning is staggering maybe time for us to get a contract with dunder	
my experience static variables should only be used for singleton everything else can be either more cleanly contained by a singleton as a or made final as a logger however i believe in hard and fast so i would take my advice with a grain of that said i would suggest carefully examining any case where you consider declaring a static variable aside from a singleton instance and see if it can be refactored or implemented differently moved into a singleton container or use a final reference to a mutable

not a heard this kind of question before and it stems from a confusion with reference where circular referencing does pose a collector count it just scans and flags referenced those flags also prevent it from going into a this is a very simple and virtually foolproof the system need to count or track inbound so there is zero overhead for shortlived but you have to keep an eye on where references a common problem are objects that subscribe to the event keeps a so you need to unsubscribe before the subscribing object can be another benefit of gc is that the logic also works in whenever your code has access to a reference that reference is guaranteed to be simply because that reference counting requires the compiler to inject code every time a reference is copied or goes out of incurring a constant when the count drops to zero the object can be immediately the system needs a mechanism to handle you can find some horror stories by searching for the com iunknown

not too sure i completely understand your do you want to have all the pools using the same but just differing by a distinguishing or do you want separate pools of tables within the one with a suffix on each table to distinguish the way you should have multiple databases for two major the first being if you have to change the schema on one it affect the if your load goes up for any other you may want to move the pools onto separate physical machines with new database security access to a database server can be more tightly locked of these things can still be accomplished without requiring separate databases but the separation will make all of this easier and reduce the complexity of having to mentally track which tables you want to operate

not valid and is not valid xml is not valid xml because the and are not valid characters inside attribute they need to be escaped using the corresponding xml entities and is not valid html either because the short closing form is not allowed in html is correct in xml and the tag is also an implicitly closed tag as per the html this means that manually closing it is actually and is equivalent to closing any other tag correct version in html the correct version in xhtml and xml following example you gave is also is not valid html or xml the name of the tag must be right behind the although the attributes and the closing may be wherever they so the valid xml is another funkier you can actually choose to use either or as your attribute quoting is single quoted and the other reasons that were posted are but the biggest problem with parsing html is that people usually understand all the syntax rules the fact that your browser interprets your tagsoup as html means that you have actually written valid and even agrees with me regarding the definition of valid and your invalid is not while my corrected version xml is not made to be parsed with but there is also no reason to do there are many xml parsers for each and every you have the choice between sax dom parsers and pull all of these are guaranteed to be much faster than parsing with a regexp and you may then use cool technologies like xpath or xslt on the resulting dom reply is not only is parsing xml with regexps but it is also a bad just use one of the millions of existing xml and take advantage of all the advanced features of is just too hard to even try parsing on your first the legal syntax has many little subtleties that you may not be aware and html in the wild is just a huge stinking pile of get my there are a variety of lax parser libraries that do a good job at handling html like tag just use

other answers talk about how to either avoid recursion or how to use tail or how to simply set a larger stack i think for completeness that worthwhile to consider memory usage patterns answer to allow more memory on lots of of many programmers will allocate buffers inside the recursive and reallocate new buffers when the function is called if return int use return this is a throwaway i bother worrying about invalid input values larger than and i will assume somebody asking a question about programming either knows how to do that or is smart enough to find important point here is that takes up 400 bytes a 32 bit 800 bytes on a 64 bit of the stack each and every time is so if is called recursively 100 then bytes bytes on a 64 bit of stack space are being used for and very likely you can modify the function to reuse the same buffer on each int if return use buffer to avoid int return course you could instead use a which handles some details for you to protect you against memory leaks and buffer overruns for the keeps the data on the heap meaning it will likely use less stack or even 80k may not seem like much but things can add if the function have many other variables then this can dominate stack space if it for the extra space the buffers take up you may be able to call the function far more may seem it does come even in nonrecursive buffers always obvious as they may be strings or for stl such as arrays put all their data on the they actually take a template argument to specify the memory allocation just that the allocator they use by default puts the data on the obviously unless you specify an allocator that somehow puts the data on the the end result will be the using stl containers will probably use less memory than using stack allocated arrays or say because although the data is kept on the heap somewhere the container can only access that data through pointers it keeps if the container is on the stack then those pointers will reside on the and those pointers take up so a one or two element may actually take up more space on the stack than the corresponding	
other way of doing this would just be a more awkward syntax for monkey there are ways involving and and all sorts of but go ahead and do it the obvious want to be careful of monkey patching in big projects or when you have because you can wind up with conflicts when several hands are all messing around in the same this mean look for an alternative syntax that accomplishes the same thing it means be careful when making changes that could affect code not this probably a concern in your particular just something that might need to be addressed in larger alternative in ruby is that you can add methods to a single def undefined method for

python the interface of an iterable is a subset of the this has the advantage that in many cases they can be treated in the same there is an important semantic difference between the since for an iterable returns a new iterator object and not just how can i test that an iterable is really an iterable and not an conceptually i understand iterables to be while an iterator only manages the iteration keeps track of the but is not a collection difference is for example important when one wants to loop multiple if an iterator is given then the second loop will not work since the iterator was already used up and directly raises is tempting to test for a but this seems dangerous and somehow should i just check that the second loop was there any way to do such a test in a more pythonic i know that this sound like a classic case of lbyl against so maybe i should just give or am i missing says in his answer below that this is primarily a problem of wanting to do multiple passes over the and that one should not do this in the first in my case the data is very large and depending on the situation has to be passed over multiple times for data processing is absolutely no way around iterable is also provided by the and for situations where a single pass is enough it will work with an iterator created by a generator for but it would be nice to safeguard against the case were a user provides only an iterator when multiple passes are this is a very nice example for base the methods in an iterator and an iterable have the same name but are sematically so is but provides a clean to tell the difference between an iterator and an

quick answer here is it absolutely should not crash just because you are mixing printf and the only difficulty with mixing the two is that the respective output buffers will not be synced by so the order of the output may be a bit mixed but it definitely should not a quick perhaps you have a formatting problem with printf passing a double when it expects a short or something like that will lead to unpredictable which might well shift depending on the order of function calls in your

regards your implementation of the crossing number algorithm the first obvious mistake is that you are not looping over all the you are one you should loop up to i n and then define i plus one as ip1 i 1 applies to the code in your original question too of course to save you having to have two copies of the second one is cn no the code on softsurfer is fine is trying to detect if cn is odd or even by testing if the last bit is if you want to the same test using the modulo operator then you should write it cn that assigns the remainder on division by two of cn to looked beyond that to see if there are any more

requires minimal file which i believe is the main cause of problems when using this kind of shared resource over a network file the reason it can get away with this is that most of the files in a git all the ones that form the object are named as a digest of their and immutable once so there the problem of two clients trying to use the same file for different content come other part of the object database is the refs are stored in files under the directory in and these do although the files are small and always rewritten rather than being in this git writes the new ref to a temporary file and then renames it over the target if the filesystem respects even if the worst that could happen would be a race overwriting a ref although this would be annoying to it should not cause corruption as it just might be the case that you push to the shared and that push looks like it succeeded whereas in fact someone but this could be sorted out simply by pulling in the other and pushing i think that repo corruption is too much of a problem true that things can go a bit wrong due to locking but the design of the git repo will minimise the this all sounds good in but not done any concurrent hammering of a repo to test it and only share them over nfs not

seen a lot of questions related to mapping dtos to domain but i feel they answered my used many methods before and have my own opinions but looking for something a little more have many domain we are using a csla model so our domain objects can be pretty complex and they contain their own data you do not want to pass these around on the we are going to be writing some new services that will return data in a number of formats for this other we are also creating a data transfer object to pass around on the question is how should the dto and domain object be first reaction is to use a dto seen this done many times and it feels right to the domain object contains no reference to the an outside entity or is called to create a dto from a domain normally there is an orm on the domain object the downside of this is that the tends to get extremely complex for any real situation and can be very idea put forth is for the domain object to the since just a lean data the domain object properties would internally reference the dto properties and could just return the dto if asked i can see no problems with this but it feels i have seen some articles where people using nhibernate appeared to use this there other is one of the ways above worth if so or if for any insight in practices for mapping dto to domain

software development is a set of values and formulated by a group of the industry leading figures in is a concrete software development methodology that can be traced back to 1995 and was created by two of the original signatories of agile scrum supports agile early approach to software project management usually referred to as implies a sequence of clearly defined steps necessary to complete any execute and then represents a very simple and above all convenient abstraction from the project management theorist point of when one stage follows another it is possible to define clear inputs and outputs for each isolate and identify techniques and tools that are most useful at every this is a clear example of reductionism in tackling project management keep splitting the whole into smaller bits until you get to understand each bit in isolation and then hopefully you will master the mechanics of their as soon as the waterfall abstraction was presented it started to firstly it turned out that process can not be clearly cut into often definition is still changed on what it seems to be organisation or even execution in the stages were allowed to overlap and theoreticians started drawing all sorts of diagrams there possible to see how the definition stage gradually runs out as execution starts picking up during the organisation again only in it is possible to accurately estimate during the planning stage how long it is going to take to develop a piece of in actual the estimates and other plans have to be tweaked right through the execution phase which gave birth to a string of complex yet not very meaningful methods as value chronic problems with the waterfall abstraction gave birth to a number of project management methods xp programming that despite many differences at the more detailed level use the same fundamental principles to tackle product development project is organised as a number of small iterations through the classic project stages execution and iteration aims at a relatively small yet semantically complete increment in product functionality or involvement throughout the every iteration goes through a separate definition and planning stage the time horizon for various estimation and planning activities is greatly it helps achieve greater hence make it easier to access measure value and costs increments help controlling the evaluate utility of the changes and keep users involved since there is always a fresh version of fully functioning it is also much easier to organise a number of teams working on a large project simultaneously when increments are kept this really helps tackling task user feedback is key to iterative since it helps the product evolve gradually in a right direction providing greater utility at the end as opposed to the uncertainly of user reaction that is natural to driven by the waterfall

speaking with databases you rarely delete you can mark it as deleted but generally speaking you keep it in your database at least for a are many reasons for some of them are you may have requirements ot keep data for a given some of them are sometimes its just a you may need to restore the the user may request their account is reopened or it may have been locked due to spamming but that was because the account had been compromised and has now been data may be deleted or archived but this may take months or even i just give relevant data a status column 1 0 and then just change the status rather than delete it of the integrity is another issue let me give you an you have two want to delete a particular what do you do about messages sent and those messages will appear in someone inbox or sent items so you delete do you set the relevant field in message to that make a lot of sense either because that message did come from go even if they active better off just marking that user as deleted and keeping them it makes this and similar situations much easier to deal also mention forum threads and so you delete those either there are other reasons to do so such as spam or because content that is related to other content forum messages that have been replied only data you can safely and reasonably delete is child this is really the difference between aggregation and the user and message relationship above is an example of composition is house and you delete a house and all the rooms go rooms cannot exist without a this is composition in entity relationship a find more instances of aggregation than composition my so the question what do you do with that really hard to erase all traces of someone without deleting things you just mark them as locked or inactive and deal with it that

synchronized functions for the same marking a method is very similar to putting a block around the entire contents of the the reason i say is because i know offhand whether the compiler emits the same bytecode or but afaik the defined runtime effect is the deadlock is a classic locking one thread locks then simultaneously on a the other thread locks this part requires that the scheduling of the threads just so happens to interleave at the right thread whatever order or then attempts to acquire a lock which is already held by the other and hence each thread goes to neither will wake until the other releases its but neither will release its lock until it wakes is	
table locks can increase the likelihood of getting not all deadlocks are caused by out of sequence some can be you have by other activity that only tries to lock a single record in the same table you are locking so locking the entire table increases the probability for that conflict to when using serializable isolation range locks are placed on index which can prevent by other sql in a way that can cause a deadlock by two concurrent operations from the same even though they are coded to perform their ops in the same any to find out what exactly is causing the set sql server trace flags 1204 and these will cause detailed info to be written to the sql server logs about each including what statements were is a good article about how to do forget to turn these flags off when

tends to be a bad idea to make fields public because it then becomes hard to force error checking constraints add to value changes in the your you have a const so the above issues are not a the main downside of making it a public field is that locking down the underlying for if in the future you wanted to change the internal representation to a or a unicode or something then break all the client with a you could convert to the legacy representation for existing clients while providing the newer functionality to new users via a new still suggest having a getter method like the one you have placed this will maximize your future

that particular post i was refering to shrinking the dictionary in order to be a more appropriate size for the number of the hood most hashtables are backed by a large array which usually points to another structure such as a linked the array starts out at an initialize when the number of elements added to the hashtable exceeds a certain threshold of the number of elements in the the hashtable will this usually involves creating a new array at twice the size and the values into the new of the problems features of a weak reference hashtable is that over time the elements are over time this can lead to a bit of wasted imagine that you added enough elements to go through this array doubling over time some of these were collected and now the remaining elements could fit into the previous array is not necessarily a bad thing but it is wasted compaction is the process where you essentially shrink the underlying data structure for the hashtable to be a more appropriate size for the

the best advice as every other poster on this topic has to write often been in the situation where this is if the code is that line embedded and undocumented magic code also likely to have another which is that deeply coupled and components are almost impossible to isolate a codebase that loads and hundreds of different database objects on components assume random parts of the cache and parts of the cache assume other parts of the cache you have to load the whole thing to get code dependant on and promiscuously state where impossible to determine setting those or even what they suggestions i can come up to fix the things hardcoded magic number obvious code perhaps a quick release that gets rid of the worst of the violations will be of low risk and make the next steps easier to organizational support for refarctoring often no will or desire to do work that add immediate and risks breaking existing there of great arguments for but not everybody buys if the organization support it you may have to give it other developers around to the same view if any probably as unhappy with the codebase as you if new code is built to better standards and people are start to fix older code as tweaks need to be a particular subsystem is really bad and has reached the point where new development is nearly impossible you can probably use this opportunity to rebuild

the top of the exception hierarchy is it is a checked exception compiler forces you to catch it or declare that you throw throwable there is also a checked and an unchecked exception compiler warn you about exception there is also an unchecked way that the designers of java intended exceptions to be used things that can go low level things that can go wrong and a program cannot recover programmer errors going past the end of an or calling a method on idea behind not having to catch unchecked exceptions is that they indicate failures or that either you cannot handle or should not exist in a properly debugged program everyone agrees with the intent of the designers of java on this and chose to use runtimeexception to mean things other than programmer

they are actually static readonly values and not that has a distinct difference in because constant values are by the various compilers and hence impossible to track their usage in a compiled static readonly values however are not copied but instead this is advantageous to your question because it means the use of them can be you use reflector and dig through the notice that minusone and zero are only used with in the vb it exists primarily to serve conversions between decimal and boolean why minusone is used coincidentally came up on a separate thread just today if you look at the value notice used to why they are explicitly defined i doubt there is a hard and fast there to be no specific performance and only a bit of a convenience measure that can be attributed to their my is that they were added by someone during the development of the bcl for their convenience and just never into the issue a bit more after a comment by the definition of uses the modifier however it is emitted as a at the il the compiler uses a couple of tricks to make this value virtually indistinguishable from a literals for this would show up in a language which recognize this trick recognizes this but does

think a few more steps to accomplishing your which is understanding the basics of game you mentioned understanding sprites and which are imperative to game but i think that initially you should spend a little time understanding the programming and methodology behind general graphical user of what language you will eventually program your game i think that learning in a modern language like java or will provide you with a vast amount of libraries and will allow you to accomplish tasks like animation and event listeners much more is a list of guides and tutorials that i think will be extremely helpful to you just as they were to me and is an for a java game framework that includes full source code and a full walk through source of writing the infamous game in complete with a control score and sound book java 5 game by jonathan harbour will introduce you to concepts such as 2d vector graphics and bitmap including sprite plus you can get it used on amazon marketplace for is an unbelievable tutorial on sprite animation that has more than 5 parts to plus written by richard a professor of compsci and an extremely reliable and knowledgeable for more tutorials by is his these sources going to possess the methodology of the parts that go into a which are applicable in any as well as the knowledge of how those parts can be actually implemented as

think i read the question a little so hopefully this response too off can get a good overview of how much memory your application is consuming by using windows task or even sysinternals this is a quick way to review your processes at their peaks to see how they are of the an x86 process will only be able to address 2gb of this means any single process on your machine can only consume up to in your likely to be able to consume only before getting out of memory much ram your copy of windows can actually address will depend on the windows version and cpu your example of 4gb the os is going to give your applications up to 2gb of ram to play in all processes and it will reserve 2gb for on the operating system your you can tweak using the switch in the will adjust that ratio to 3gb for applications and 1gb for the this has some impact to the so review that impact first and see if you can live with tradeoff a single application to be able to address greater than your going to need to set a particular bit in the pe image this has good info on this subject game changes under x64 good reference limits for windows address

think this has to be the most frustrating thing ever done in web yet one would think it would be the easiest of all things in the world to that is need 2 separate lists of radiobuttons on my one set allows a customer to select an the other set does also but for a different but only one set can have a selected tried this using 2 radiobuttonlists controls on the same got around the nasty bug with groupname assigns the uniqueid which prevents the groupname from ever working because 2 radiobuttonlists have the same groupname for all their radiobuttons because each radiobuttonlist has a different uniqueid thus the bug assigns the unique id as the name attribute when the buttons are since the name sets are they are not mutually so i created that custom radiobuttonlistcontrol and fixed that groupname when ended up happening is when i went to put 2 instances of my new custom radiobuttonlist control on my all was swell until i noticed that every time i checked for or not matter which i was the value always spit back and i was not able to figure out why onto the third try tonight and into the break of dawn i tried to instead just scrap trying to use 2 custom radiobuttonlists altogether because of that issue and try to spit out 2 sets of radiobuttonlists via using 2 repeaters and a standard input html tag got that ok but the 2 lists still are not mutually i can select a value in the first set of radiobuttons from repeater1 and same goes for i cannot for the life of me get the to be mutually exclusive sets of mutually exclusive radiobutton

trying to export classes from a dll that contain objects such as and the whole class is declared as dll export class problem is that for members of the complex types i get this class needs to have to be used by clients of class able to remove some of the warnings by putting the following forward class declaration before them even though not changing the type of the member variables class class like the forward declaration the for when the member is compiled but is it does it realy change anything when the client compiles this header and uses the std container on his will it make all future uses of such a container possibly not and does it really solve the problem that the warning tries to warn this warning anything i should be worried about or would it be best to disable it in the scope of these the clients and the dll will always be built using the same set of libraries and compilers and those are header only using visual studio 2003 with the standard std update like to target you more though as i see the answers are general and here talking about std containers and types as maybe the question really we disable the warning for standard containers and types available to both the client and the dll through the same library headers and treat them just as treat an int or any other does seem to work correctly on my if so would should be the conditions under which we can do should maybe using such containers be prohibited or at least ultra care taken to make sure no assignment copy constructors etc will get inlined into the dll general like to know if you feel designing a dll interface having such objects for example using them to return stuff to the client as return value is a good idea or not and why like to have a interface to this maybe the best solution is what neil butterworth suggested creating a static classes containing objects from a

was talking about this with someone here the other as we use stored procedures for all database access we were discussing linq in and the linq to sql iqueryable she quickly realized that using linq with sprocs would be redundant at best and difficult at advantages of linq to sql are that the code lives in one and what is occurring in the db is very in addition the development time can be depending mostly on as there is one less work product to advantages of as i see are also stored procedures allow for much better access control for a as they can inspect the sproc before and allow the application use access only to execute that sproc rather than access to all the tables this makes for much better reviews of database contention and performance the other advantage i see is that while linq to sql will generate a correct in the case of complex queries there are times where you hit a case that causes poor optimization on the db in those cases you would either rewrite the or provide hints to the both are breaking with the dba in a but have but i feel really nervous when working on a large high transaction load db and not knowing every possible statement that would be executed by a so sticking with sprocs	
was thinking about this the other day and wanted to see what the so community had to say about the it stands right now common lisp is getting some attention as a web development and with good reason which sure you are already was wondering how one would go about using a library in a shared environment in a similar fashion to i set up something like sbcl as an interperter to interpret fasl files like python or what would be the best way to use libraries for come as asdf installable but it would be a stupid amount of overhead to require and install the library each and every time a request is in mind this is for shared would it be best to install system wide copies of the libraries for use in reduces but there may be problems with using the correct version of the allow users a control to install local copies for more no version tell them to wrap it into a module and load it on demand like python does not sure this can be done with just being able to load a library for use would be the best but i think a lot of them are designed to be used this looking to hear your the best way to use libraries in a shared hosting

way been approaching it is to have a display layer that knows nothing about the gameworld its only job is to recieve an ordered list of objects to draw onto the screen that all fit a uniform format for a graphic so for if a 2d your display layer will receive a list of images along with their scaling and source and whatever other attributes a display object could the view may also be responsible for recieving high level mouse interactions with these displayed objects and dispatching them somewhere but important that the view layer not know anything sementically about what it is that only that some kind of square with a surface and some the next layer down is a program whose job it is simply to generate a list of these objects in helpful if each object in the list has some kind of unique as it makes certain optimisation strategies possible in the view generating a list of display objects is a much less daunting sort of task than trying to figure out for each sort of character how its going to physically render sorting is simple your display object generating code just needs to generate the list in the order that you and you can use whatever means you need to to get our display object list each prop and npc has two a resource database and a character the database assistant presents for each character a simple interface from which each character can pull up any etc that the character will probably want to come up with a fairly uniform interface for fetching the but going to vary a little from object to a tree or a rock need as much stuff as a fully animated npc for you need some way of generating an instance for each type of you might implement this dichotomy using your built in or depending on your you may need to work a little beyond for having each resource database be an instance of a resource database and each character instance being an instance of a this saves you from writing a chunk of code for every single little object in the this way you only need to write code for broad categories of and only change little things like which row of a database to fetch images forget to have an internal object representing your then your job to query each character about where they are in relation to the it is basically going around each character instance and asking for its display do you look and where are character instance in turn has its own little resourcey databasey assistant thing to so each character instance has available to it all the information it needs to tell the camera what it needs to leaves you with a set of character instances in a world more or less oblivious to the nitty gritty of how they are to be displayed on a physical and more or less oblivious to the nitty gritty of how to fetch image data from the hard this is it leaves you with as clean a slate as possible for a sort of platonically world of characters in which you can implement your game logic without worrying about things like falling off the edge of the think of what sort of interface you would like if you were to put a scripting language into your game simple as possible as grounded in a simulated world as without worrying about little technical implementation details what this strategy lets you the separation of concerns lets you swap out the display layer with whatever technology you open software adobe nintendo without having to fuss around too much with the other you can actually swap out the database layer to do things like reskin all the or depending on how you built swap in a completely new game with new content that reuses the bulk of the character collision path finder code that you wrote in the middle

we generate classes in by returning all the sprocs from all of our databases and adding the correct parameter types and names to a object and then returning it in one giant this means we can do things like when we want to pass parameters to a for a stored procedure without having to add the parameters with their relative data types every single time we make a it also means that we have to look up the exposed parameters for each sproc because they are merely put it into for every parameter you want to deal with in a sproc have to do this is undesirable as mean an application would explode into gazillions of lines of code to achieve really quite simple looking into refactoring this in such a way where we can do something like instead by making it strongly unfortunately this means our folder will be twice the size it already is because such a large quantity of code would be written a short example of what i class dim cmd as public sub uses the configurationmanager to get the connection string for a certain dim cmd as new end public sub param as end public sub param as end public sub param as end public function as return end end there alternatives to having to do this that we are unaware sure this is a common problem amongst many businesses developing typed stored procedure resolution in

well along in the development of our first wpf app for silverlight 3 looks but for this application i would still have chosen the application centers around presenting and manipulating very large sets of images hosted on a central server on our the software rate will be mass import of new images from a local no internet connectivity performance make this a project well suited for of our upcoming will require many remote users to access a single data store on our the data they work with requires significant validation and error so running that code locally is they will need the ability to work both on and offline and remain in synch with sql data sloob out of the will most likely be our choice for that one so they can have all the silverlight advantages but use it like a regularly installed even without an internet formats have their the trick will be to avoid using silverlight for everything we have more tools than just 1	
what are the downsides favouring immutable objects in incompatibility with orm or presentation based frameworks are complicated by immutable objects since they constructor are no default arguments in which forces us to always provide all of the necessary dependencies overriding can be argument names are not usually available through which forces us to depend on argument order for dependency immutable objects is still a boring the compiler should take care of the implementation as in it possible to design a system object that predominately uses immutable immutable objects makes great building blocks for other objects favor since much easier to maintain the invariant of a complex object when you can rely on its immutable the only true downside to me is about creating many temporany objects concat was a problem in the

what i gather on that creating anonymous types for and using that to get the if the no easy way to add methods on to those if the xml structure will be the same every time the sp why not create a concrete class that has all the properties you and populate a collection of those objects yourself with the that you can easily add any methods you need directly into the based on our discussion in the a the code when building up the an overload to definetype which takes a type to create an interface event have to have any methods in and when dynamically building up the extend that interface using the overload i linked you then create an extension method on that interface that does the another overload that may be of interest that takes a type to and code create an interface isaveextentable suck at naming stuff in the code you liked to in that find a method change it to private static typebuilder assemblyname an new assemblybuilder assemblybuilder modulebuilder modulebuilder typebuilder tb new return create an extension method on that interface to do the public static class public static void isaveextentable save most likely need to use reflection in your save method to get all the properties since the type was created	
what i understand about transactions in subversion this should be possible in but i know any tool that supports background is that we are discussing a migration from pvcs dimensions to and the main feature cited as missing in subversion is a design part is an arbitrary collection of files that can be handled all the source files needed for a idea to replace this is by copy operations in a which copy the relevant files into a but if all files are copied separately this may lead to a lot of which may clutter the so it would be nice to avoid more background project consists of several subprojects which are released but which share some common source files and external libraries imported from other reason cited for the design parts is restricting dependencies on source is for managing the products of so that all of them can be updated in version control in one both kinds of files are somewhat sprinkled across are about 5 developers on the can multiple copy operations be done in a single

when i ask do you not use cpan i am referring to the people who refuse to use cpan modules high quality ones like not all cpan code is of high and it is fine to stay away from modules that are trivial or are based on experimental code got annoyed at a developer the other day for wanting to bring in just because he know that strftime was in on someone want to know how to do something without resorting to the perl module commonly suggested for that he or she did not want to install the module from this made me think about the reasons i have seen people avoid using cpan and i came up with five reasons for this behaviour and the solution for each scare you get over scare your sysadmins work around them installing in your home directory and use the lib are using a hosting service that prevents you installing modules get a better are cheap services that behave like target machine necessarily have the module use par or target machine is totally locked down you to rbash and have to provide code to a third party inclusion on the combination of 4 and going the are using an embedded version of perl that load modules you are but this is very if you use and why are the answers above not i am not asking why you install directly from cpan on production i am asking why you avoid using the modules from cpan via packaging systems count as using cpan to do you not use cpan

whole reason to have accessors and modifiers is to provide yourself with an extra level of extra level of indirection allows you to provide a read only view of your variable to a public while not allowing your data member to be you could still use a private or protected allow you to do special error validation and corrections when a value is for example you could make sure there is a terminating slash if the user specify this ensures that your class state will always be can also shield your members from having them exposed to allow pointers to by not allowing pointers to them from the you can ensure that if your object goes out of scope it lead to a extra level of indirection for also allow you to be able to change the data member that they a getter you can also obtain different views of your when your data member is actually stored in is not the reason to use but a nice side effect of using getters and setters is that you can set a breakpoint inside your modifier for example to see exactly when it is you should use them or not is a judgement call based on your if you have so many members that it is a huge pain to provide getters and settings you could consider storing the data members in a struct and using that struct inside your class you could even provide for an object for the whole struct at

working on a video display device that uses custom timings for resolutions at848x480 and 800x480 that do not conform to any vesa the device has an edid that specifies these would like to know the process that windows xp uses to determine the resolution to display and how it presents the user with a list of this seems highly dependent on the video card manufacturer and have observed wildly different behaviors on different seems that vanilla windows xp does not query the edid except at boot however laptops and custom video drivers sometimes seem to query the edid at will in a computer with no hit presentation and the device name shows pcs seem to have no trouble generating 848x480 or but some just seem to ignore the detailed timings and fall back to a vesa if you specify a custom timing what is the chance that any given video will be able to generate the proper vga often the edid information will be transmitted to the but if you open the windows display and select the device in the settings the slider of available modes does not show either 848x480 or it usually just shows 640x480 among a list of other standard modes not the custom modes this then you can often get the device to display at 848x480 or 800x480 by selecting it in the list of all modes under display properties settings advanced adapter list all when you select it switches to the proper if you go back in to display properties you will see the mode you selected in the but the slider only has the one it should also show is this just a fact of life when dealing with windows xp and video it would be great to know exactly how windows populates that would greatly appreciate any resources that discuss the details associated with all of i know that this is not strictly speaking a programming but it is closely related to a programming problem that i am and i am having trouble finding any information on this does windows xp use a edid to determine allowable display

world has check down and upvote think is still relevant even though there is a lot of hype surrounding bdd and other testing being if you are up for you could bypass learning and start with something like rspec and shoulda right but there is something to be said about following through the examples in the agile web development book to see where the ideas from bdd came find myself still using for some projects since it comes with rails and is still a very great testing long story i think obsolete but not the cutting edge any bdd is a testing paradigm shift especially if you start using cucumber and but fantastic once you get into shoulda is the easiest to make the transition so i would start with then move to then give rspec and cucumber a are testing or at least interested in the best in the end it matter what you use as long as you are happy with

wrong with the boost but the developer guidelines are a bit to relaxed once a library is in the developer can change he wants behavior and happened to me with where parts of the interface and just changed or simply dissapeared even a notice in the change similar thing happened with behavior recently the behavior was never precisely official answer is that you should view each boost version as a different the problem with that is that the bug fixes will almost never end up in the previous versions if the library versions quality of any boost library depends on the quality and dedication of and sometimes there are no being i still find some of the libraries genius and use then

you cannot do cron fields hold the values for day of month and day of 5 10 means run at on every 10th of every 5 12 means run at on every day in 5 1 means run at every can make it run on a series of specific as the crontab format does accept april through december would be in that case for the month but that does not take into account your wish for having this limited to is no mechanism to set start and stop dates for you can always script this of make a cronjob run every day and check the current date to be before if it is make it remove or something more thought crontab of 7 do what you want but it would start at june 1st and run through december skipping the first part of june and december 31st would have to be scripted in the x	
you cannot hash uniquely all strings to integers there are more strings than so there have to be you can have a hashtable that can hold all sets of data all your but to get you need to change the code of the not the hashing i see a problem with the hashing function you in this it really does rotation of checked on rotating by 4 means that strings having two assume parts swapped will have equal if you change it to something relatively prime to the hash size this will only happen for swapped parts of length

you possible they are trying to detect when wraps to zero goes and keep it pegged at the max value for whatever type or they may be trying to deal with a situation where is incremented in multiple threads either this is buggy they are trying to wrap to zero or one too many increments will cause the problem if they are trying to deal with being incremented not sure what problem really trying to solve or how they are trying to solve are the jon skeet it still sounds odd to me because unless offset is the latter expression may not get the latest value even worse than that even if is volatile nothing to serialize reading the new value of with another thread that may be incrementing so the very instant after the expression the value of any number of other threads may come along and increment it number of so at the expression is but using that technique can be harmful because you may end up using a value of that to the situation where using to track an array index or something given the name sounds like exactly what might be going when you atomically increment the array element at that index becomes yours to if you use the expression as in the you may suddenly be trampling on an array element that really belongs to another think of a legitimate reason to use offset i at best harmless but it could introduce hard to diagnose problems use to the comment by simon svensson that pointed to a google search for the usage in the it looks like this code usually comes from the output of a to it even uses this expression to increment local variables threading an in the cases where is a local this expression falls into the useless but mostly harmless variety will be a if the increment really more or less a very inefficient expression fact it appears to be the way the converter converts the expression to see actually this conversion is buggy for anyway because it returns the incremented value when it should return what the value was before really bad thing is that other people may look at that code and the way i need to use

you said it reasonably well right truth is that the comb is almost always a bad idea exception happening for example when marshaling or when for a short interval you may not have all the type information at as josh a sign of a bad class hierarchy way that you a bad idea is that it makes the code if you use and the type hierarchy then it probably breaks that comb everywhere it you then lose the benefit of strong the compiler help you by catching errors ahead of is somewhat analogous to the problems caused by typecasts in me extend this a since from a comment it appears i quite the reason you use a typecast in or it that you want to say use this as if it were a in there is no run time type information around at so just working without a if you typecast the generated code is going to treat that address as if it contained a particular type no matter and you should only that it will cause a error instead of silently corrupting typing just raises that to a in a weakly typed language like ruby or python or everything is an untyped you shoot messages at it at runtime and see what if it understands a particular it like a it handles can be very handy and because it allows marvelous hacks like assigning a generator expression to a variable in or a block to a variable in but it does mean vulnerable to errors at runtime that a strongly typed language can catch at compile a language like you have duck typing at you tell the compiler what type going to treat something you can get something like duck typing by using type so that you can do something a reference to an analogous to a void in some code that assigns something to some more at run fine as long as x is a kind of at or at otherwise or no your you protect yourself by using a comb of and object x code code code instanceof else if instanceof misslecontroller else if something else protected against the but got the responsibility of doing something sensible at the now imagine you make a change to the so that can take the types and you now must go through all the code and find all the instances of that comb and modify now the code is changes in the requirements mean lots of code in striving to make the code less oo solution is to use polymorphism which you can think of as a kind of limited duck defining all the operations that something can be trusted to you do this by defining a superior probably that has all the methods of the inferior in a class like that is best expressed an but it has all the type properties of a in you can see an interface as being a promise that a particular class can be trusted to act it were another public interface veeblefeetzer public class fooddispenser implements veeblefeetzer public class misslecontroller implements veeblefeetzer public class floorwax implements veeblefeetzer public class desserttopping implements veeblefeetzer you have to do now is use a reference to a and the figures it out for if you happen to add another class a subtype of the compiler will select the method and check the arguments in the a reference to anything that implements some code that assigns something to some more	
you say probably cut wondering which xslt approach you have in approach would be to somehow transform the instance data for the not sure how that would work in and maybe why you said xslt approach would be to use xslt to produce a schema tailored for the current state of the form then use this schema to build the for the transformed schema would exclude definitions for fields that ready for display this sounds quite feasible to me that volunteering to the i know well enough to say if its caching would be suitable for your have thought that you want for reasons that get try to clarify what i what i was hearing in your description is that the current state of the record may affect the structure of the for the legal values for field a may be constrained by the values of fields and some of which may actually be unknown and unknowable at a given this ambiguity might make it difficult to present the form using a unified thought was that perhaps you have to limit yourself to an immutable if the current state of the data would be better represented by a modified schema one that reflects the allowed enumeration values for field or the union choice that is currently allowed for field then i proposed that perhaps transforming the schema before creating the form might do the to your comment about be concerned that caching might result in stale form definitions being served up when newer ones are due to changes to the data and the perhaps you could avoid this by permuting the namespace url based on the current state of the customized hope this

you truly need to ensure that and change while you are doing this then you need to use the same synchronization for access to and your only each read and each write to either of these values needs to use the same memory timeslice or whatever mechanism is you can ensure that if a b test will not change while you are reading but you have to use the same synchronization mechanism for access to and to reflect a later edit to your question that you are looking for a it depends entirely on the processor you are using and on how long and are and on whether or not these memory locations are consecutive and aligned these are consecutive in memory and 32 bits each and that your processor has an atomic then you can issue an atomic read to read the two values parse the two values out of the do the math and return what you want to assuming you never need an atomic update to and at the same but only atomic updates to or to in then this will do what you want without

you want to both trap invalid use of the library to access the objects when they have been as well as have a api and in the then you could consider have a different api for debug and nondebug suppose for simplicity that you have only one class of objects you call this class the pointer type which you return from the api for accessing the internal objects is then defined objectptrfacade objectptr object the facade is class which you it works roughly like objectptrfacade copy constructor and assignment here object operator const return object operator const return object return this whenever you build a debugging you have a special kind of smart pointer in use which asserts before accessing the object that its is higher than that the object still if the object has been you get a failing which is better than a null pointer general of course it is so that using does not help if you have users of the because they could call and then still make a reference after the returns a which is
