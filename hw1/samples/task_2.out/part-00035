a personal been developing a kernel in things are going in fact i have very good support for much of available in kernel land implemented nearly the entire libc and of the more difficult and compiler specific things is rtti and exception for now disabling exceptions but rtti is something i want since things like can be very to make this i have a basic implementation of which matches what expects and then i link to and this works rtti works like a been toying with some optimization options and would like to someday have as a compile time obviously this being a kernel and having to interact with assembly there are certain functions which play nice with not having the parameters on the to solve i use the following asmlinkage this works very the problem is that when you do a the compile emits calls to some implicitly defined internal functions in the support libraries previously and does so respecting the of course since i linked to the support they may or may not in my have a compatible calling to a nice pretty kernel since these functions are implicit prototype in any of my and they have mangled it is impossible to add my asmlinkage attribute to are 3 possible solutions which come to about all those 2 support libs same flags as the be annoying and know if be cleanly isolated from the and toolchain upgrades very but should make the compiler when calling code found in a particular option 3 my gut feeling is but i figured that i would ask since there are a few gurus on here do i make ignore for certain

a rather extreme approach check out roy timothy yuan vesta approach to software configuration vesta approach is based on the following versioned storage of all sources and vesta uses explicit version numbers rather than configuration by we the descriptions name all elements contributing to a every aspect of the computing including header environment is fully described and controlled by we mean that configuration descriptions specify how to system from scratch using only immutable sources descriptions themselves are versioned and immutable and is a particular description always describes precisely the same build using the same even after new versions and descriptions have been derived file the storage and naming of derived managed automatically by the vesta storage thereby easing of building multiple releases or building for multiple target caching of all build vesta features a shared build results so developers can benefit from each dependency the vesta builder dynamically detects all so none can be omitted by human by we mean that the builder detects which sources are actually used process of constructing a build result and records dependencies only dependency analysis does not make use of any knowledge the build tools it is thus in the terminology of gunter for if a compiler reads file in the compiling file vesta will assume that the output all of even though a tool with knowledge of c might be able to items in that could be changed without changing the the

absolutely need the consumer to lock in order to prevent the producer from appending to the file before the reader can imagine this writes and receives opens the fires again and writes another 10 reads the last 10 closes the happens next depends on if your named event is manual reset or auto if auto then the consumer will see the second and go back and read the same thing if manual then the consumer is going to reset the event and miss the last thing that the producer that even with the lock you have a race condition if the producer can respond quickly that the producer might be able to put a second record into the file before the consumer is able to read the appears that what you have here is a fifo queue implemented in a and depending on the ability to process data faster than the producer can create if you can that then otherwise the consumer will have to keep track of where it last read so that it knows where it should read

always think this is easier to explain with a you have an icustomerrepository an ishoppingcartrepository interface and an icheckout you have concrete implementations of those interfaces and checkoutservice concrete class has a constructor that takes an icustomerrepository and an ishoppingcartrepository ishoppingcartrepository set fields for use in some methods when you want an icheckoutservice implementation to do some work you tell your ioc container which concrete class it should use for each interface type and ask it to build you an your ioc container will go and build your classes for injecting the correct concrete classes into the constructor of your it will also build dependencies all the way down the class heirarchy so for example your shoppingcartrepository takes an idatabasesession interface in the your ioc container will inject that dependency as long as you have told it which concrete class to use for your some code you might use when configuring as your ioc container code would typically be called during app class appregistry public to get an instance of icheckoutservice built up and ready to with all the dependencies passed into the constructor for you would use something checkoutservice hope that makes

an exception is raised during a crud operation performed by your biz layer it should be handled by the biz but this is because you want feedback to reach the presentation layer you also want to log the you could the exception this will bubble it up to your presentation add a data pair to the property of the exception and then wrap the raised exception into a custom exception type and throw exception will then be bubbled up to your objectdatasource and will be available via the property in your event you should then check if this property is if the objectdatasource wraps plural in a so you will probably need to get at the you could modify the ui elements to provide necessary feedback to users that the operation did not complete you would need to set the property to true to prevent the exception bubbling up to the page for logging the i would log the error in both layers biz logic layer and presentation

another way to look at assume you understand the concept of an array something that supports the operation of where you can get to the ith in one no matter how large a for if you want to store information about a group of people who all happen to have different a simple way would be to have an array that is large and use each age as an index into the thay you could have access to any of course there could be more than one person with the same so what you put in the array at each entry is a list of all the people who have that so you can get to an individual information in one step plus a little bit of search in that list a it only slows down if there are so many people that the buckets get then you need a larger and some other way to get more identifying information about the like the first few letters of their instead of using the basic instead of using any function of the person that produces a good spread of values can be the hash like you could take every third bit of the ascii representation of the scrambled in some all that matters is that you want too many people to hash to the same because the speed depends on the buckets remaining

any graphics compression algorithm is going to do what you heavily optimized for compressing 2d arrays of numbers into the smallest possible to other thing to since looking to use compression to reduce processing is that getting really high compression ratios generally involves more calculation to compress and decompress the you may reach a point where spending more time compressing and decompressing the array than running the neural again to on your it sounds like what you may want is a use the curve to turn your array into a 1x2500 line and then come up with a formula that approximates the values you want for each cell of the the array have to be it may be much easier to fill with a space filling curve if a square of slightly different the hilbert curve works nicely for dimensions that are powers of for

application appears to have the same characteristics as i wrote a mysql custom storage engine to efficiently solve the it is described your data is laid out on disk as an array of 2m fixed length entries per each containing 3650 rows per of 20 bytes row for one entity per read pattern reads one it is contiguous on disk so it takes 1 seek and read 3650x20 about 80k at maybe so it is done in a fraction of a easily meeting your read update has to write 20 bytes in 2m different places on in simplest case this would take 2m seeks each of which takes about so it would take if you spread the data across 4 disks it could take the places are only 80k in the which means there are 200 such places within a 16mb block disk cache so it could operate at anything up to 200 times reality is somewhere between the storage engine operates on that kind of although it is a little more general purpose than a fixed length could code exactly what i have putting the code into a mysql pluggable storage engine means that you can use mysql to query the data with various report generators the you could eliminate the date and entity id from the stored row they are the array and may be the unique id if you really need it since is and store the 2 values as then your stored row is 6 and you have 700 updates per 16m and therefore a faster inserts and a smaller compare to flat notice that comments general favor flat forget that directories are just indexes implemented by the file system and they are generally optimized for relatively small numbers of relatively large access to files is generally optimized so that it expects a relatively small number of files to be and has a relatively high overhead for open and and for each file that is all of those are relative to the typical use of a file system names as an index for a which i take to be a integer 1 to 2million is in a programming you would use an not a for and you are inevitably going to incur a great deal of overhead for an expensive access path that could simply be an array indeing if you use flat why not use just flat and index on performance of this application is going to be dominated by disk seek the calculations i did above determine the best you can do you can make insert quicker by slowing down select you make them both it matter whether you use a or one that you can add more seeks that you really need and slow it down for indexing its the file system index or a database causes extra compared to array look and these will slow you on benchmark have a table that looks very much like yours almost exactly like one of your it was 64k entities not 2m of and 2788 the table was created in the same insert order that yours will and has the same index a select on one entity takes seconds to inspect the 2788 which is about 130 seeks per second as expected 8 millisec average seek time the select time is going to be proportional to the number of and not much dependent on the number of will be faster on disks with faster seek using a pair of sata2s in raid0 but that making much you the table into entity alter table x order by the same select takes 198 millisecs it is reading the order entity in a single disk the alter table operation took days to complete 182m a few other things the measurements tell your index file is going to be as big as your data it is 3gb for this sample that means my all the index at disk speeds not memory insert rate will decline the insert into the data file is linear but the insert of the key into the index is at 180m records i was getting 153 inserts per which is also very close to the seek it shows that mysql is updating a leaf index block for almost every insert you would expect because it is indexed on entity but inserted in day so you are looking at to do your daily insert of 2m by whatever effect you can get by partition across systems or

are a few things i would like to respond i think and vinay all have good this explains why calling the destructor on a local variable is a bad realize this is just a simple homework problem and you are probably just trying to keep your stack class but you might consider a container class instead of an array of in your stack not sure your emptystack and create functions are doing what you think they are when you declare your original and reversed stack classes in the main program the memory is allocated for your internal character not really necessary in this case to have a create perhaps if you were allocating memory on the heap for your character you would put that code into the create function you chose to leave it out of the constructor for some but not the case emptystack really doing it would be better to have empty stack set the stop member variable to at least that way the stack would appear to be empty the next time someone tried to use a lot more that could be said about this but it might be better if you tried some of the suggestions here like using the and this after your homework it will help you a lot more in the future if you find the solution

at it appears that the types all line up getting back values and passing in the value so my guess is that the mark operation correctly marking the objects and the sweeping phase is snatching them by wrapping the child objects in an array that has a correct marker function you protect your data more a theory than a solid but maybe something to start back to digging a little too deep into the ruby looking to wow some edit add onto i was just digging in and on line the precise test you want to is do what you must in your mark function to include in your flags so the sweeper sweep

been designing and developing software for windows mobile and windows ce in and for quite a few years i been doing so for honeywell hand held purchased by honeywell in where worked on nearly all aspects of the from drivers and services to line of business guis and of i tell you one language is better than the i probably spend a split of my time with and each platform definitely has their own place in the mobile will give a suggestion that you likely stay away from any device that runs an os as old as wince especially if you are even considering the reasoning for this is that only at cf embedded in rom of the os rom meaning that you would require a cab file to install at least cf you could develop with cf not worth the pain of using such an old most wince devices these days come with cf installed in the rom so i would at least look for that same you may even want to consider using a device with windows mobile or as they are easy to program with and will always have cf in case wondering why i have not mentioned cf or cf just because the first mobile platform to be release with those versions will be windows mobile which is not out though you can always install the framework if you want wince definitely gives you a more look and feel to its gui over its windows mobile so that is all a matter of your programming preference and what your end users want and comments on sdks being only a thing this is just not if you have a proper sdk you should have all of the same access to any devices or drivers that you would in but with the ease of for honeywell provides an extensive sdk for all of our devices in vb and and the portion of the sdk actually has functionality than the you will have to do a with our code from you want to take a look at the sdk talking freely available to download and has some great i would actually consider the provided sdk as more important than the hardware in many cases most of the the hardware for the devices is pretty much the they all have arm laser or image based i looked at the intermec link you posted and it look like that unit actually has a built in you using an external scanner hooked to the a look at the honeywell offering if you want got devices with probably the best imager based bar code scanner in the built into all of our and we have a rock solid sdk should i wrote a lot of and the sdk provides extremely access to all of the hardware on the stop my sales pitch for one language over the really all depends on what exactly you want to and services be written in anything but native c or so is out for anything like and can absolutely be your friend on mobile devices in terms of keeping things since you need the whole framework to run the

been writing a lot of code recently that involves interop with the win32 api and have been starting to wonder the best way to deal with native errors that are caused by calls to windows api the calls to native functions look something like nativefunction returns true when successful and false when an when an error the msdn docs usually tell you that error code can be discovered by calling getlasterror long as setlasterror flag has been set in the dllimport is the equivalent managed it throw new line that raises the exception can be equivalently rewritten as such i new this is all well in that it throws an exception appropriately containing the win32 error code that was set as well as a description of the error as the property of the exception i have been thinking that it would be advisable to at least if not of these exceptions so that they give a slightly more error one more meaningful in whatever situation the native code is being i have considered several alternatives for a custom error message in the constructor for new custom error the in another exception object so that both the original error code and message are retained is now the of the parent new custom error same as except using another as the wrapper same as except using a custom class derived from as the wrapper same as except using a bcl class exception as the parent when not sure whether even appropiate to set the to the in this case for a wrapper but not a interface that make it obvious that win32 interop is happening behind the what i want to know what is the recommended practice on dealing with win32 errors in i see it done in code in all sorts of different but i was curious whether there were any design if be interested in your personal preferences you even use none of the above a

can imagine a couple possible in and are both actually if you choose to provide custom allocation behavior for an object by overloading these you must be very careful in doing so to ensure you introduce some types of objects require that you overload to avoid memory management for if you have a reference counting smart pointer object the boost you must implement and you must be sure to do so consider this broken refcountedptr mdata return t implementation here is broken because it manage the reference counts on and it does not decrement the reference count on leading to a and it does not increment the reference count on leading to a possible memory fault down the road because the object being pointed to could be deleted before all the actual references are that if you do not explicitly declare your own for your the compiler will provide a default implementation which has behavior identical to the implementation shown here that completely broken for this particular as the article says in some cases you must overload and you must be careful to handle all situations i realize that the reference was an online rather than a even after reading the full article not clear what was but i think eckel was probably referring to situations like the second one i described

can think of the first block argument as an the result of each run of the block is stored in the accumulator and then passed to the next execution of the in the case of the code shown you are defaulting the to each run of the block adds the given number to the current total and then stores the result back into the the next block call has this new adds to stores it and the end of the inject returns the which in this case is the sum of all the values in the or another simple example to create a hash from an array of keyed by their string do this we are defaulting our accumulator to an empty then populating it each time the block notice we must return the hash as the last line of the because the result of the block will be stored back in the

can use the default ruby cgi module to parse the query string in a rails controller like will give you what you but note that you get any of rails other extensions to query string such as using so you will have to us string rather than symbol i believe you can set params like that with a single line and overwrite the default rails params depending on how widespread you want this you may need to monkey patch or hack the internals a little however the expeditious thing if you wanted a global change would be to put this in a before filter in and use a new instance var like

cdata section is for the purpose of allowing literal text that would normally be interpreted in a special way in an xml that something that looks like an entity or something that looks like xml anything in a cdata section can be inside valid xml without a cdata just need to use entity references to encode the various special characters so they be treated as xml but as character data that is the value of a the following is perfectly as long as it is what you the value of the element is the value which will not be interpreted by the xml parser as the entity reference for the copyright you can also do the this looks xml the value for the element this looks xml do this without a cdata this looks xml is much less but equivalent as far as an xml parser is if you did this that the element is defined an a schema or dtd as containing a string and not then your xml parser will this looks xml you use the cdata or entity escaping to protect the special characters from the xml parser so the client of the xml data can get the value of which happens to contain xml markup to be the above example is but if the schema or dtd says that the element contains or then it is an xml html or xhtml entities that are not defined as part of xml itself are not valid xml unless they are your xml parser will return an

comments say that the code assumes outputting in however it seem to matter because through a lucky quirk your most significant byte is always to explain that further when your value is at its maximum value of you should be writing but the actual output from your code is which is this happens to be near the proper maximum value of but with the bottom 8 bits all it would be better to always use 32767 as the maximum and then discard the bottom 8 bits if means that even though outputting the effective resolution is only 8 this seems to account for the lack of sound made a version of your code that just dumps the raw data to a and see anything otherwise wrong with the bit shifting no unexpected changes of sign or missing but there is a buzz consistent with 8 bit sample for what worth your math will be easier if you calculate the wave equation based on sample and then worry about byte offsets samples 2 new channels int i j i int wave frequency i byte msb byte lsb for c c if	
common and are just two structs that add they are for convenience of creators of function object so they have to do those but they behave what you want is function object comes to const str no error make it a const str no error can take it by value and then return the copy from if use it to apply it to some which would allow the function object to update some state variables among its is an example that does it like i would accept them by value because they are usually small and copying them allows greater so i const str no error will then be able to take a copy of fct and save it and can be and update some members is part of the whole point of remember if you take a function object by const you generally copy because the user could have passed a copying it then will try to locally declare a function instead of a local function accepting will accept a function pointer instead when a function was which can safely be

could preprocess the source code files before compilation to add a random amount of random code that actually do it would be simple enough to add innocuous comments in the real source code where you wanted your junk code to be as far as what you do when you are not trying to do my suggestions would be not to loop or wait for too or allocating too much i would err on the side of not caring what the size of the binary output and letting that vary possibly the easiest and most effective way to accomplish that might be to just include some libraries that get and yet get optimized out because they were not if you have your compiler call something quick just so that the lib will get included for your final binaries would differ in size by quite a bit that but the program be appreciably any	
could produce a hash based on the file contents there are two good reasons to do you to never store the same file twice for if you have two copies of a music file which are identical in content you could check to see if you have already stored that and just store it separate name is just meta from the so you would have a storage system which is indexed by the hash of the file and you then associate the file with that hash lookup risk of finding two files that compute the same hash that indeed the same depending on the size of the hash would be and you can effectively mitigate that by perhaps hashing the file in chunks could then lead to some interesting storage optimisation scenarios

couple of ideas that leap to length you could always generate phrases by picking words from a for a good example of this in see length is more use a list of syllables and the result would be a nonsense but pronounceable you might need to filter the results to remove undesirable actual pronounceable is not but you want to be able to quickly verify a code as coming from your then a small crc of a counter packed into a byte array and encoded with or similar would you can improve the human factors by keeping the code and by picking an encoding that eliminates similar letters have and all in the the code needs to be longer than about 5 characters in then consider adopting a standard punctuation scheme that breaks it into is much harder than to read and the number five here is a wild there is probably literature on the best this is really a crypto if there is significant real value to be had from forging these then consult a crypto expert for a best practices answer because rolling your own will cause grief

currently do some testings on the multipage meeting workspace template to check whether it fit our needs to be the base template for our you might a multipage meeting workspace is designed to be able to manage several dates within a single workspace and to display either pages that are only related to a certain date or pages that should appear on every you examine a multipage meeting workspace with sharepoint designer you can see that there is a library which contains all the pages of the pages that are displayed on every date are stored in the root pages that are only displayed on single dates are stored in folders which are named with the according now we come to my in order to set the permission for a single page that is displayed on each i iterate over the page library to find the page i want to change the permissions the listitemcollection of the library pretend to contain the number of pages i expected it to but when i then iterate over the collection it only returns the pages that are attached to the actual neither does it return the pages which should be displayed on every date nor the pages for the other have already tried to get the pages by using and with impersonation as the system also tried to get them via a command line application without using any context it seems as the that you can only get the items which are related to a certain is also followed by the object how could i get all pages of a multipages meeting workspace regardless of the actual the pages of a multipage meeting

currently translating a java project to flex a large part of the project involves asynchronous program will connect to a start downloading shortly after it will need to download context data in the same format by at various points during the stream or additional http calls may be to get an encryption use a blocking call to perform the http requests to get the key which would effectively pause the keyframe or stream while the http is which would then carry on where it flex being and http requests being implemented with asynchronous impossible to implement the code in the same new to not sure what the normal practice would be for planning to save the state and relying on the http completion to the paused or maybe use timers for the should i decouple the data being received from the processing it and buffer it while the http requests are being or is it safe to ignore the progress events and let flex the os buffer anyone have any advice on an architecture which would make all this thanks for the answers so far not sure i understand what getting but look into one of the connections is already a raw the question was about pausing it and grabbing some other data from another source that looks to flex translating asynchronous comms from

danger of doing that sort of code the general is that you might break because there are two general templates for boolean if instanceof return boolean if return first will still work with the anonymous subclasses talking about but the second thing the second is considered best practice because instanceof necessarily might not equal in this case however uses the method which merely checks that the other object is an the interface so is something to be aware of i would suggest is to do it slightly list new more wordy but less likely to get in trouble this way as the resultant class is a

do agree with carlos that using event subscription in the view is not a good as far as i understand it leads to eliminate any code behind from the view and i really like it of the proprs of the mvvm is ability to unit test but i still beleive that view model can be tested even if it popups all we need is just to use window with initialized content with needed view i think there could be 2 possible situations when vm should open new either to show window or to show a window which is dependent on the business in the first case new window code is the only code of the command for or in the second case we have some decision making logic which opens the but in any case we can move the code which opens new window into separate and when testing our vm just to mock this even this separate class can be some kind generic windowscontroller which will tracks all windows in the but still we can say that view model opens popup using helper windowscontroller and view does not know anything else about other all business logic stays incapsulated into model and view

er we need to know about a team is the name and therefore we need a table to store the seed the only candidate key is team name so we will use that as the primary to keep things ncaa team names are unlikely to change over the course of a single tournament or contain duplicates so it should be an adequate table can be used to pair the teams into each of the match foreign keys to the will ensure that the teams exist and a primary key over these values ensures that teams are only matched up against each other foreign key to the table from the table will record the logically the winner would need to be one of the two teams participating in the match a check constraint against the primary key could ensure the outcome of a match up has been determined the seed could be retrieved from the team table in order to compare against other in order to determine subsequent match upon doing so an fk to the resulting match up can be written to the determining match ups in order to depict the progress of the tournament this data could probably be derived at any also modeled out the games of each match a game is identified by the match up it is a part of and a sequence number based on the order in which it took place during the match games have a winner from the team table score could be recorded in this table as

fine to compare iterators which are from the same container as a for loop but this only makes sense if you are moving one or other iterators in either the increment part if the for loop statement or in the body of the for loop in this for loop you compare against but the for loop never changes this means that either there will be no iterations or the for loop will never you probably want to use and not for the and work for all for i iter starts where you want the loop to you may want something like for iter still learning we probably instructive to work through an algorithm like but you should be aware of which probably does what you final need to and i see incrementing iter or it in the outer for loop invalidating the logic in the later for the point in points to one past the end of a so you can use it for loop termination but you try to dereference an iterator which is to

guess is that have a binary which is output by a fortran these can look like compressed files because they are not readable in a text allows you to write the data out to a file without formatting so that you can reload it later without having to parse the is that you need that original source code in order to see what types of variables are written in the you have no access to the fortran source but a of time to you could write some simple fortran program and guess what types of variables are being i advise as fortran is not very you want some simple source code to look at which details binary read and write in and includes a code just start by replacing with for a double precision

have a websphere java ee application that requires for which looking to use work would require its own view onto data coming from a most of this would be but it would still need to go to the database to get we anticipate that the duration of the overall work of all of these threads would be enough time for underlying data to be a result we need to ensure isolation of the data in use by the application and queried during the course of the seems that the only way to ensure this is to have a transaction and use xa but like to avoid this complexity if at all and are looking for ideas or any to what degree at do work components support container managed perhaps i just meant our thought was that xa transactions and messaging incur overhead that work components sharing a transaction could dataset being operated on would be distinct rows of each needing calculations done on whereas these could be divided up onto different threads operating on the comparative memory overhead of copying off a queue seems would you tens to of milliseconds per also focusing on improving the logic processing as a separate i need to use xa transactions when what is required that all threads have a consistent view of data in a single my answer to this is that each thread would require its own jpa entitymanager and would need xa in order to coordinate their if i can do this without xa then so much the management with

have almost any sql in your database access layer as it should be merely abstract the communication with the database regardless of what actual sql the now famous mvc your business logic what typically contains the sql which forms the model all these definitions what you have now is moderately to end up with piles of sql has to depending on your priorities and performance requirements here is what i would do by performance there is noticeable repetition in the throw in a quick refactoring iteration to hide all the common sql inside the methods do not necessarily have to execute but just build it all depends on your application and in which way the sql is if you have an underlying layer which does the actual communication with the maybe part of the refactoring could be to add consider a query which is a very good balance between performance and you can only find a query builder as part of an orm or database access layer and its sub propel so you can either port a query builder off one of those to your project without using the whole layer really be hard as all of them are this add any noticeable performance consider the doctrine this has considerable effect in performance you will end up with very maintainable code never consider putting the sqls into resources or something like

have looked for a example of a but cannot find one either because i understand the builder pattern or i am trying to do something that was never for if i have an abstract automobile and abstract builder methods to create car i should be able to send all 30 of my choices to the have it build the pieces i then build my regardless of which i should be able to it in exactly the same problem is most examples hard code property values in to the concrete which i really think should come from a i thought the idea was to send my choices to the director a data and have the builder create a customized product based on my problem is i want the builder methods to actually create the parts then assign them to the not pass strings but real strongly typed product i want to create a form on the fly by having a builder manufacture form fields for including a an input this way i can read the object from my check out the pass this to my builder and add the newly created user control result to my web every builder example i find only has hard coded data instead of passing choices from the main code to the builder and kicking out a customized everything seems to be a big static case for if i have three parameters with 10 choices i want to build 30 concrete builder i want to create only enough to manufacture the properties my product which may be only am tempted to have the director exist in the main code there should be a way to automatically determine which concrete builder method to call similar to polymorphism and method overloads that is a very bad instead of using a case statement within the time i need to add a new product i will need to modify the existing which is

his excellent clr via jeffrey richter said that he like and recommends not to use he gave some but i really can anyone explain to me why i should or should not use with automatic does this a i added jeffrey a property may be or field access is always readable and you define a it is best to offer both get and set accessor a property method may throw an field access never throws an a property cannot be passed as an out or ref parameter to a a field the following code will not sealed class private static string name get return set static void string n public static void for the line of code the compiler emits the error a property or indexer may be passed as an out or ref a property method can take a long time to field access always completes common reason to use properties is to perform thread stop the thread and a property should not be used if thread in that a method is if your class can remotely your class is derived from the property method will be very and a method is preferred to in my classes derived from marshalbyrefobject should never if called multiple times in a a property method may return a different value a field returns the same value each the class has a property that returns the current date and each time you query it will return a different this is a and microsoft wishes that fix the class by making now a method instead of a a property method may cause observable side field access never in a user of a type should be able to set various properties defined by a type in he or she chooses without noticing any different behavior in the a property method may require additional memory or return a reference to is not actually part of the so modifying the returned object has on the original querying a field always returns a reference to an object guaranteed to be part of the original working with a property a copy can be very confusing to and this characteristic is should i avoid using properties in	
hit a stack pretty much out of luck for debugging the problem blowing your stack space leaves your program in a so you rely on of the information in it at that point any stack trace you try to get may be corrupted and can easily point you in the wrong once the stackoverflowexception too according to you catch a stackoverflowexception from so the other suggestions to surround your code with a for that probably this makes perfect given the side effects of a stack overflow surprised ever allowed you to catch only real option is to engage in the tedium of analyzing the looking for anything that could potentially cause a stack and putting in some sort of markers so you can get an idea where they occur they obviously any recursive methods are the first place to so give them a depth counter and your own if they get to some value that you that way you can actually get a valid stack	
honestly not a fan of coding bootcamps or short duration courses in terms of money an issue i would say go for it but since you are paying your own way and brought up the money aspect going to assume that at least some consideration must be taken before dropping find that i can honestly absorb much more material and at greater depth by simply reading a book and attempting exercises or small projects certainly there are some tips tricks that can be imparted to you through actual instruction that you might not glean right away from but those things be the bulk of the knowledge you have to programs remind me of short duration certification expensive and of little you have to be you are there for 4 you are going to learn how to setup the development shown some canned examples that you follow along with illustrating the basics of the and other iphone that really worth it to to a serious professional developer would simply sit down with a few of the books and start banging out some chapters on their time in my save yourself some money and spend bucks on and take a few days off

i suffered a lot with the same dilemma when i moved to it really depends on your from the java ee world so i would recommend to have as little business logic in your backing beans as if the logic is purely related to the presentation of your then it is fine to have it in the backing believe one of the strengths of jsf is actually the fact that you can expose domain objects directly on the managed i would therefore strongly recommend the otherwise you end up making too much work for yourself in manually exposing each furthermore it would be a bit of a mess when inserting or updating data if you encapsulated all the there are situations where a single domain object may not be in those cases i prepare a before exposing it on the if you are going to encapsulate every object property that you want to i would recommend that you instead bind ui components to the backing bean and then inject the content directly into the value of the terms of bean structure the turning point for me was when i forcefully ignored all the stuff i knew about building web applications and started treating it as a gui application jsf mimics swing a lot and therefore the best practices for developing swing applications would mostly also apply to building jsf

i worked out where i was going the image scan data is saved in but the actual important info is encoded as variable length bit this means that the end of the actual image data does not necessarily fall on a byte when the jpeg encoder needs to pad out the number of bits to make the byte boundary it simply adds a series of the way the actual pixel info is stored is a little too complicated least for to but basically everything is encoded within minimal coding units or these vary in size depending on the chroma horizontal and vertical sizes being either 8 or 16 for each there are dc and ac parts that make up a single component of or cb and the problem was that the dc components are stored as values in relation to the relevant dc value of the previous so when i added the new image data from jpg it had stored its dc values in relation to 0 there were no previous but it needed to take into account the final dc values of the last mcu from jpg that makes need to do an initial decode of the image data to find out exactly where the image data ends and then strip the trailing you also need to change the initial dc values in the second jpg you then need to reencode the appropriate add 1s to fit to a byte et you want to append in the its a little more you have to rearrange the mcus so that they scan in the right jpgs scan from left to then top to bottom and then adjust the dc values far only tested this on single mcu but theoretically it should work with bigger ones i only worked this out thanks to the owner of this jpg related

intend on writing a small download manager in that supports resuming multiple connections per the info i gathered so when sending the http request i need to add a header field with a key of and the value then the server returns a http response with the data between those roughly what i have in mind is to split the file to the number of allowed connections per file and send a http request per splitted part with the appropriate so if i have a 4mb file and 4 allowed split the file to 4 and have 4 http requests each with the appropriate implementing the resume feature would involve remembering which offsets are already downloaded and simply not request this the right way to do if the web server support guess is it will ignore the and just send the entire sending the http should i specify in the range the entire splitted or maybe ask smaller say 1024k per reading the should i write it immediately to the file or do some kind of i guess it could be wasteful to write small i use a memory mapped if i remember recommended for frequent reads rather than writes could be is it memory what if i have several downloads not using a memory mapped should i open the file per allowed or when needing to write to the file simply i did use a memory mapped file this would be really since i could simply have several probably be using but this is a general question so i left code out of a download manager that supports

is an even smarter and see what this code is doing and how we can improve code is serializing the one byte at a for each byte calling which is checking the free space in the internal vector if we have no room for another memory reallocation will happen the reallocation will not happen frequently typically happen by doubling the existing the new byte is copied and the internal size is increased by has a requirement by the standard which dictates that the internal buffer be also happen to have an and here is the best code you can come up is a test invalidlength you probably want to make this much to avoid resizing compressedbytes is as large as the length we want to p this is valid code and designed by the standard for such p points to a buffer that is at least as large as a copy all bytes in one above cast can be done in one go with the but it be this is more serializing this way even with the union is that on an processor the least significant byte will come while one a machine the most significant byte will come if you want to be you use a math method

key is to adopt a practice of only deploying code from the source control not familiar with but it must implement the concepts of the question of what to deploy then falls out of the build and release tagging in the source control tips works best if you split the package spec and body into different files that use a consistent file pattern for each for package and for package if you use an automated build process that can process file patterns then you can build all of the specs and then the this also minimizes object invalidations if you are only deploying a package the time in to configure an automated build process that is driven from a release or build state of your source control if you have even a moderate number of db code objects it will pay to be able to build the code into a reference system and compare it to your qa or production	
kind of instancecontextmode and concurrencymode are you using on your service percall you might want to check if you can reduce the overhead of creating a server instance for each single instances do you really need try using percall	
kind of reference does the client project have on the core is it a file or a project try removing the reference and it as a project	
know any free configuration management but why not place your design under source just add it to or whatever you are this is good it is always up to date you check it of it is you can keep track of changes by using the compare available in almost any source control may not be the solution but you are a small team of developers so for that it is more than i see now that you already mentioned a source control my i think it should work	
know for a fact you can use that feature when creating silverlight 2

know if multithreading will help until you build the but it seems that you really just want better before doing anything you need to measure the performance of the perhaps there is some code that is so use a profiler to identify	
know if there are any formal rules on the subject but i usually add type defs at the location most befitting the use within the the typedef is only used within one class then add the typedef inside the class the typedef is used by several unrelated classes add it in a header file at a namespace scope for the actual name of the i name it whatever makes sense for the i give typedef names any special convention such as prefixing with or anything along those for

know if this is your exact problem or but you probably do not want but instead that your schema should etc etc	
know if you are doing but you need to specify a string instead of the object when using i see the codes you have in your so i may be way the way i do it is in a prefix	
know if you serve a html document as a word document with the it will open in word just just do anything here is an example using classic	
know it is but in code reviews provide little value to begin there are few errors found almost never if you have competent most code reviews end with trivial action items and fix any unless you count grammar as a big more important review is did you test the what tests were did the developer do a sufficient level of that is where you will find out if the code works or is not that having peer reviews is a bad but the realities end up getting in the the main reality is that software is usually hard to understand and when it hard to understand then the problem it is solving is hard to while some companies have easier in the places i have worked it would frequently take a day or more just to understand the problem and requirements the code is solving before even being able to begin to dive into the code to understand if the code works if you understand the how can you find errors in the most people have the luxury of 1 days to properly review someone that there are some where code reviews are productive even at a rudimentary single most important reason for code reviews is that it forces any developer with pride in their work to make sure their code is of good enough quality that they would be willing to show it to other original developer in lead developer knows what they is having someone do the coding for code is either simple to grasp or a variation on a theme that is common at the in answer to your i would say	
know mssql but 36 million rows is not large to an enterprise database working with mainframe rows sounds like a configuration table to me not a big fan of of this access talking about i assume they can handle pretty substantial database sizes with their enterprise suspect days may have been too fine a resolution to divide it if indeed it needs dividing at	
know much about sifr because flir and it better to me than just looking at the 3 beta demo i noticed that it seem to react to browser preference text that i increase my in firefox and reload the the headings stay the same those who know is this an actual limitation of the script or did they just do the demo page it actually handle call that a major advantage for which does work this people with impaired vision who use screen readers probably appreciate that the text resize to their from a quick glance at you should be able to make resized text work in consider it a bug to be not an essential disadvantage of the	
know mysql very but i think have to give the standard performance answer thoughts only with not database a new database means a separate file in the file these files could then be put on different filesystems if performance of one needs to be separate from the new database will probably handle caching all tables in one db is going to mean a shared cache for the whereas splitting the tables into separate databases means each database can have a separate cache all databases will share the same physical memory for but there may be a limit per to the separate this means that if one of your datasets becomes more important than the it can easily be pulled off to a new the databases has an added benefit of allowing you to deploy updates more easily than with the single to having multiple databases means the server will probably be using more memory it has multiple sure there are more for the but i am drawing a blank i suppose i would recommend the obviously this is only with the understanding that there may very well be a better way of handling whatever you are actually	
know not what you you may want to start by switching from hsqldb to h2 is a relatively pure java it is written by the same guy who wrote hsqldb and he claims the performance is much using it for some time now and very happy with it should be a very quick transition a change the connection create the so worth a i believe in trying to get the most of what i have before rewriting the application in a different try profiling it to identify the bottleneck

know of no library but i recall rather trivially writing such	
know that a page method is able to access session if it then you may be i recall that access to session state is so that only one request at a time can arrive for a given	
know that using callcontext is the right move here if the desire is simply to provide access to your if that is the the lock statement is all you you have to make sure you are applying it you are going to get access because you are going to have separate instances of callcontext when calls come in on different threads different very different from making access to a resource you want to share the same value across multiple then the lock statement is the way to if you want specific values on a use the or use the static methods on the thread or the threadstatic attribute any number of storage	
know the blackberry has a custom ide but if memory serves me quite a sub par does anyone know if a different ide out there for the is the best ide for development on the	
know there are a number of threads on here about how to use the using statement and calling the i have read the majority of these i call does it call i want to use an object but then use it again in another code should i not call which also means to omit the using to if a filestream is wrapping a streamwriter and i call dispose on the this will call and on whether calls on the if i call close on the this will only call and on the checking il a good way to answer these questions about what is happening under the advanced questions on the using	
know there is an but not	
know this is not the answer you are most probably looking for but i would suggest that such a framework will be very hard not to find for doing something like dumping the stack cannot be done in a portable way as it can in a language like which not only shares a common runtime accross all but provides powerful introspection capabilities program in but my guess is that it can provide a in the same way as the stack is probably just another object in the runtime which can be inspected and on the other hand has none of these its meant to be a language that basically adds to c sure others will come up with much more elanorate explanations of over c but thats another is not rich enough at the level required to provide the kind of features you require in a generic there may be some code that could get some of this info at defined points for you out but it certainly wont be standards regards to graphs that sounds much more like which you should either be able to find something or more you can perhaps output your log messages in a format which can be interpreted by some of these existing things you could look at would be integrating with for which there may be richer analysis tools for would provide you with a capability along the lines of the one advertised for smartinspect that is based a lot of what i said here about comes from previous experiences trying to find decent frameworks in to do introspective type things as proper mock objects	
know this question is a month and almost certainly moved on from this but i decided to take a look at had no problems executing your the behavior worked properly and correctly prevented the searching turned up the following from cancel parameter for office events is ignored in visual studio behavior of ignoring the cancel parameter seems to exist for excel versions 2002 and below when using code created using visual studio 2003 framework is a complex given in the article that involves the interop it looks pretty if a fair amount of would be easier to upgrade to vs 2005 or vs if that is at all possible for i compiled my code using vs 2008 targeting and ran my code on excel 2007 with no the even if you get this the user will still be able to enter a value into the cell by typing the value within the formula executing a or the so i am not sure that this is a great way to try to prevent the user from entering a value into a perhaps you might want to look into protecting the worksheet i know that this is very but i hope that it is of some value or	
know what a datapager control but if some kind of and you want to do something like at the bottom of the stackoverflow new questions then yes it is completely doable in most the page numbers are just so what you can do is find out what class the pagination control uses for the and style them the way you for if the html looks something like want to include something like this in your 1px solid 1px solid you know the css selectors to use for the pagination i suggest taking a look at some online references on css the firebug plugin for firefox is also very helpful in identifying layout elements and the styles currently applied to like urls with underscores in them

knowing additional context about your there could be a couple of things going the first that comes to mind is that you have a very visual each item in your listbox is going to create some graph of visual the more you the longer it takes to those items are not visible on the silverlight is still doing the work to render basically this means that the and pass are being performed on all of your listbox even if they trick is to use virtualization to force silverlight into not performing the passes on controls that are not visible within the visible region at the is a blog post that describes how to do this with a it take much to abstract this to a listbox or better you could simply make the control container for your listbox a virtualizing stack panel and then be done	
knowing alot more i would tend to lean towards the first option if this is a speed critical portion of the just make sure the code is well if you have the speed to play with and there too much difference in the time between the two do the because when you come back to it in two make a lot less sense why the item model is pulling category info

layout support is done through subclasses of some of them like behave a little bit like swing layouts but no way ever be able to take swing code and compile it into is a common when it comes to written in java solely because java is statically type and widely supported with world class the fact that written in java has nothing to do with any desire by the gwt team to allow you to port to the web is a different environment to the and since your code ends up compiled into javascript it would never make sense to take any kind of java desktop application and hit the convert what applets tried to do many years we all know how that turned out

like probably cpu all the programs you listed depend highly on memory and cpu rather than disk since it looks like you have plenty of memory guessing mostly cpu slowing you you really do wish to improve your disk performance without spending much money you can try putting your disks on a raid 0 this will make your computer treat them like one large data storage volume and speed things up by reading from both disks keep in mind that this also increases the likelihood that you will lose data since the rail volume could become corrupt or one of the disks could fail data on both disks to be you can try buying a faster disk newegg sells western digital raptor drives the fastest sata disks from between these could give you a boost in disk io depending on how good your current drives

might be out of the scope of a java in global keyboard hooks are definitely out of the scope of simply using but i can help you get moving in the right you have some point you into the direction of native which will allow you to use native since you want to stay in the java i suggest not directly using jni because have to write some confusing native code there are several wrappers for jni that allow you to use the functions but the native implementations are abstracted but a lot of these cost the best solution for i is native this allows you to directly call native libraries from within the implementation not will be cross you have to make separate implementations for a good example for windows keyboard hooks in the examples on the project for opening own window not in a do you want the applet to not run within the browser but in its own separate or just be in a separate window and still rely on the browser window being you want to simply launch a new window and still require the browser to be then a good frame window new is the title is the public void you want the applet to spawn a new process and run without the need of the look into

most important point is that heap and stack are generic terms for ways in which memory can be they can be implemented in many different and the terms apply to the basic a stack of items sit one on top of the other in the order they were placed and you can only remove the top one toppling the whole thing like a stack of a there is no particular order to the way items are you can reach in and remove items in any order because there is no clear like a heap of licorice does a fairly good job of describing the two ways of allocating and freeing memory in a stack and a what extent are they controlled by the os or language heap and stack are general and can be implemented in many computer programs typically have a stack called a which stores information relevant to the current function such as a pointer to whichever function it was called and any local because functions call other functions and then the stack grows and shrinks to hold information from the functions further down the call a program really have runtime control over determined by the programming os and even the system heap is a general term used for any memory that is allocated dynamically and out of the memory is typically allocated by the with the application calling api functions to do this there is a fair bit of overhead required in managing dynamically allocated which is usually handled by the is their call stack is such a low level concept that it relate to in the sense of if you disassemble some code see relative pointer style references to portions of the but as far as a higher level language is the language imposes its own rules of one important aspect of a is that once a function anything local to that function is immediately freed from the that works the way expect it to work given how your programming languages in a also difficult to the scope is whatever is exposed by the but your programming language probably adds its rules about what a is in your the processor architecture and the os use virtual which the processor translates to physical addresses and there are page they keep track of what pages belong to which you never really need to worry about because you just use whatever method your programming language uses to allocate and free and check for errors the fails for any determines the size of each of it depends on the operating system and a stack is usually because by definition it must be contiguous memory on that in the last the language compiler or the os determine its you store huge chunks of data on the so be big enough that it should never be fully except in cases of unwanted endless recursion or other unusual programming heap is a general term for anything that can be dynamically depending on which way you look at it is constantly changing in modern processors and operating systems the exact way it works is very abstracted so you normally need to worry much about how it works deep except that languages where it lets you use memory that you allocated yet or memory that you have makes one stack is faster because all free memory is always no list needs to be maintained of all the segments of free just a single pointer to the current top of the compilers usually store this pointer in a fast for this subsequent operations on a stack are usually concentrated within very nearby areas of which at a very low level is good for optimization by the processor

mostly solved after some digging round in problem came down to way too many tables in the local schema tables had been created in there coincidently at some archive tables being included in the dump and a select from the data dictionaries taking 14 seconds to fix the i did three all unneeded tables 250 out of archive tables from the schema dump the result of the long running improved the time from the dump for the remaining 350 tables from about 90 minutes to about 15 more than fast code as follows inspiration not copying and pasting this code is fairly specific to my but you should be able to get the you need to create the temp table it takes about 2 or 3 minutes for me to do still too long to generate with each and fairly static anyway module class def from where owner and not like escape do t tabs todo think of some way to automatically create the table table created create table as select as as from where and and not exists from uc where and def name result select from where order by indexes do if indexes

msdn article 6 improving it says the asynchronous calls unless you have additional parallel asynchronous calls from your web application only when your application has additional parallel work to perform while it waits for the completion of the asynchronous and the work performed by the asynchronous call is not cpu the asynchronous calls use a worker thread from the thread in you are using additional the same time that you make asynchronous such as calling a web method or performing file the thread that makes the call is released so that it can perform additional such as making other asynchronous calls or performing other parallel you can then wait for completion of all of those making several asynchronous calls that are not cpu bound and then letting them run simultaneously can improve is confusing to my understanding was that when you make an asynchronous call that no thread is used while but that an iocp is set with a reference to your callback is it true that you should only use async calls when you have parallel my understanding was that for an web it is often a good idea to change a webmethod to when you will be calling an bound operation and implement the whole thing someone help me understand what is meant by calls use a worker thread from the thread in you are using additional and the difference between workerthreads and implement an webmethod asynchronously if you can

my experience inodb is slighly faster for really simple pg for more complex myisam is probably even faster than innodb for but perhaps slower for mostly varchar are you indexing them with you normalize some of cost you on the but may save time on subsequent as your row size will thus fitting more rows into memory at one so you have two query time against the and updating the to the in my mysql myism is bad at on tables the size of your daily to 1m with rather wide flat i found it was faster to the table than to insert and wait for the and attendant disk this or might not select from the tables but no insert the new records as then create the indexes on new wait a drop old and rename new table to old in response to the fourth i know that myisam is always that i know in my particular i was at how much faster copying the table and then adding the index as it i was doing something similar to what you were copying large denormalized flat files into the and then renormalizing the but an not also think i found that overall innodb was given that i was doing as much inserting as a very special case of database that copying with a select as foo join was also faster than an update which as the update was to an indexed

my we also use i installed but had already used and it really offers many great refactoring and supporting renaming methods and reordering i really like is that according to your corporate code you can configure resharper to give you hints on style violations in different severity levels quickly apply according like ms but much easier to configure and more absolute favorite feature is by entering only the you type tshwlov and resharper will know that you mean the class from some referenced library named year i have tried the devexpress after i was quite impressed by the things that oliver sturm did with it on basta spring interface catchier and more impressive than there are huge arrows flipping around your ide and things like though the core functionality is rather had the feeling that coderush is more focussed on code creation than on more shortcuts for tasks like creating variables favorite feature there was a which always shows you all available in your current this makes you learn those commands where in resharper you have to look up most of them in nested suites are really powerful and it after months of using them you will probably still discover new which you have always needed without knowing i decided in favor of resharper mostly because of i was more familiar with it and devexpress was using much resources on my notebook and occasionally even slowed it by i use a much more powerful machine maybe i will give it another try

neither ie6 nor the standards browsers are the margins collapsing with its this is correct as per the quoted difference in renderings is caused by interpretation of which margins flow you give each div a background colour it makes it easier to see what is happening or more adjoining vertical margins of block boxes in the normal flow the defined a float is not in the block boxes created before and after the float box flow vertically as if the float they flow together and have adjoining vertical margins which may ie6 ie7 in quirks gets this and thinks that the float breaks up the causing no collapsing to the general confusion surrounding vertical margins and compounded by the browser recommend avoiding vertical margins and using padding instead wherever

never used the boost so reader appears to allow you to interact with the socket with a this approach abstracts the complexities associated with socket so it would be preferable especially if you are new to socket it makes a lot of sense for data it is especially convenient if you are doing very simple data such as there are cases where you need control over the data if your receiver receives a bunch of messages at the same you may prefer to read each message from the socket instead of processing them after the fact from the on the sender if your messages are structured as it is often easier just to send the object instead of first converting the object to a the functionality would be preferable in this my own socket programming i usually prefer dealing with the functions since it gives me more flexibility even though it is slightly more i hope that

not saying that and is not insane horace but i am saying that there is a sane way to expect this i am dealing with i am focused on the elements in the array the index because the index is the method is each with or or this is also consistent with the index being viewed as an optional is equivalent to which is consistent with i am dealing with i am often more focused on the keys than the and i am usually dealing with keys and values in that either or you want then either explicitly use a defined method as brent longborough or an implicit method as maxhawkins is all about accommodating the language to suit the not about the programmer accommodating to suit the this is why there are so many there are so many ways to think about in you choose the closest and the rest of the code usually falls out extremely neatly and for the original is the way to iterate through an array in i think the core way without powerful syntactic sugar or object oriented is to index in 0 puts ruby is all about powerful syntactic sugar and object oriented but anyway here is the equivalent for and the keys can be ordered or key in puts my answer way to iterate through an array in ruby depends on you the programmer or the programming and the the better ruby programmer makes the better choice which syntactic power which object oriented the better ruby programmer continues to look for more i want to ask another is the way to iterate through a range in ruby question is how i came to this is nice to do the puts i like to do the puts i actually mind doing that too but when i am teaching going i want to show my students a nice symmetry with minimal only adding a or a step but without modifying anything can do puts puts i like but you puts puts puts puts puts puts i want this could ultimately def i want to teach pure ruby rather than object oriented approaches i would like to iterate creating an array for any range not just using any extra object oriented power no class believe this is impossible without defining a which means modifying the range class to use if you can do this please let me otherwise confirmation of impossibility would be appreciated though it would be perhaps ruby addresses for your time in reading	
not so daily coding practice to use this could be considered something as an advanced starting from this simple important to better understand concepts behind the word terms of and taking it simple as an appdomain is an isolation container even in terms of memeory inside it all the assemblies needed by an application are loaded and even if this concept is more complicated to explain in details hope not about yor question to going so from the appdomain class first of all is used to obtain access to the application related executing application this could be done viea the singleton property implementation in this way possible access the loaded access to the data in terms of unwrapping created instances from loaded assemblies in created the appdomain class is used more in the same assemblies in the the could be usefull to take a view of the code of the new microsoft framework yet extesibility which is truly based on concepts like appdomains creations and dynamically loaded a simple example of things and examples of what you can do with i can share this hope i answered your

not totally clear on what but this is what it sounds know how to use post and aka html to pass data between using javascript are a couple of interpretations of you doing something like my my my something my and 3 are examples of using javascript to make the buttons do 4 is a standard html form button javascript is not being the standard html form behaviors will cause the button to submit the data to whatever page is specified in the form tag like the thing to understand is that are ways to send data around between webpages between the browser and the the process of sending the data around can be triggered by html javascript function that calls a url or triggers that a form get or form elements like not intending any but the way you asked your question makes me think that not trying to figure out different formats to transfer the data to the receiving page other posters and figuring out how to parse cookie values or iterate through your form fields to create a query string would be really here are some your form was already using javascript to submit the form or 3 you just add the same onclick part to an html my function submitmyform might look something like get the form object you can also do this with the var myform use the submit method of the form in add a javascript behavior to a normal html anchor one note in users expect the rule go buttons do not a hard and fast but people generally are happier when a button is used for things like submitting form

of the answers are correct in saying that this is a specificity problem but are incorrect or incomplete in explaining the specificity in your case is than and so that rule wins even though it comes css rules are located these rules 1 if the declaration is from is a attribute rather than a rule with a 0 otherwise values of an attribute are style sheet these rules have no so and the number of id attributes in the selector the number of other attributes and in the selector the number of element names and in the selector the four numbers a number system with a large gives the in your case you have two a b c d 0 specificity a b c d 1 specificity 0001 is lower than 0010 and thus the first rule are two ways to fix to make a rule more avoid doing this because it is confusing when you have lots of rules spread out over several a selector for the td you want to you can add a class name to it or an id and this will allow you to supersede the rule from the linked css 0010 0101 0011 fixed the specificity rules for comment prompted me to the which does show that the selector contributes nothing to the specificity shiny and shiny and

only are bug reports a suggestive measure but they are not really how is the one big bug may be worse than having 5 small on the other hand it may not so you would need to get into the specifics of each individual bug is going to be a could go with how long it takes to fix each but that can be easy to play add a simple fix it which counteracts the time it took to fix an honest to goodness bug that was harder to can use lint tools and unit tests to improve the code quality without being the lint one is a relativley simple process change that you work at over time off with x warnings on an existing code base and then reward the people that remove the most warnings over a period of time turn it into a positive rather than a tests are another reward the code with the fewest bugs and the most tests the tests are properly written then odds are the best tested code will have the fewest again this is a positive reward and an encouraging thing for the tests make the code and people are not are many other things like but off the top of my head those will have a noticeable impact are impartially on the quality of the product which is the end

only purpose for a code review is to improve the quality of the code and the quality of the processes that produce the with that in review must never be undertaken by a single person and should always include all of the programmers involved in writing the if someone who wrote some code you intend to review is not postpone the must be no artificial distinction between and both are part of the same team and must have the same results of the review must never be a general statement like code is of it should spell out in with specific examples why and where the code fits into these i sound a bit dogmnatic because i was once subject to a hostile review of legacy code in an app that i was managerially responsible but which nobody on my team had i was explicitly forbidden to rewrite the code and was not allowed to take part in the code the review basically said code is which we already and did nothing to raise the quality of the product and everything to lower the morale of the

orm compared with stored procedures it except your concern is speed think the problem is many people think of orm as a object to to code less or simplify sql while in reality is well an object to relational db is used to persist your objects to a relational database manager and not just to substitute or make sql easier although it make a good job at that too you have a good object or using to make or even if just trying to get some orm is not worth in the other hand you have a complex system modeled through objects were each one have different rules and they interact dynamically and you your concern is persist that information into the database rather than substitute some existing sql scripts then go for	
orm will always add some overhead because of the layers of abstraction but unless it is a poorly designed orm that should be the time to actually query the database will be many times more than the additional overhead of the orm infrastructure if you are doing it for example not loading the full object graph when not a good orm will also give you many options for the queries run against the database so you can optimise as required as

points the biggest to the experiment in the paper is that code is always written under some about what is cheap and what is apart from that the experimental methodology a java program create an oracle of object instrument back in the is actually quite brilliant and illuminating my personal opinion is that confound does not detract too much from their my is that using a runtime means accepting a performance hit to your application will be 3x but the real landscape of programs is littered with and be likely to find a huge scatterplot of data if you could perform the experiment on lots of programs across many application with gc sometimes winning and manual often the landscape is continually changing will the results change when multicore software designed for is also my answer has the thesis that to so many all evidence about software engineering is

primary benefit of is that you have to write any nearly glue code to get remote processes to there are a wide variety of client libraries available for many in the case that you have a rich api of can be a very easy way connect remote processes to that performing the same task with a plain post will require you to convert an api to a form and dispatch requests into api there are a few systems that can help with but it is certain to be more difficult than just exposing the api through the other if it you already have a rich api exposed through plain form encoded hard to justify the work of porting both client and server to another

problem is that your template is going to be instantiated in more than one compilation unit as it is completely therefore in every compilation unit that uses the template you will end up creating one singleton compilation what you would need is to force global so that all compilation units reference the same template the upcoming standard will support this via what you can do now is to disable automatic instantiation in your project and manually instantiate the templates that you use this way when you use the template in any compilation unit you will generate an unknown reference to the implementation which can then be satisfied by the linker from the compilation unit where you do the explicit

question below is based on the assumption that controls are always binded to data source controls in the order they are so in our example sqldatasource1 will connect to data source prior to sqldatasource2 and thus will be populated with values before and reason for that being that was declared before if then when exactly does retrieve a value from i assume after event handler and before event but when it is a then those parameters will get loaded from a viewstate on the in the order they are assume controlparameter is bound to property c1 of a control i would imagine that on postbacks controlproperty would always be able to get value from no matter of what type c and even if c has viewstate but may i ask if a page is created for the first a value for controlparameter also be retrieved from the moment lstcities retrieves data from data has its value apologize for not replying but i realize and when i spent good 20 minutes trying to get my 3 braincells to work but not sure if i quite so controlparameter evaluates and thus retrieves value after c has been controlparameter only reads its own state and only to determine if it so controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed in order to fire onparameterchanged before binding takes place thus it checks its viewstate during how will controlparameter know that its viewstate has changed it will know on first postback from the first time the page is created viewstate will always be marked as so how from one postback to controlparameter know whether its value has changed between i assume controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed only so that it can fire onparameterchanged but why is handling that event so first time a property evaluation happens is on property evaluation you mean controlparameter checking its own thus you mean controlparameter evaluating which i assume happens after c has been bound really appreciate your really sorry for again taking your will do my best to make this my last is called both in onloadcomplete and when data binding takes inside the following sentence is also if is called when data binding takes then what that means that when on next postback is called in and controlparameter will already have same values and thus if null storedvalue null actualvalue always return false when is called in onloadcomplete and so onparameterchanged event will never get if the i fail to see the need to call in controls are always binded to data source controls in the order they are declared

question is a little i wrote an algorithm for breaking up a into convex but now having trouble proving that optimal minimal number of convex polygons using my prof is adamant that it be done with a greedy algorithm such as this but i think of a if anyone can prove my algorithm is suboptimal i would appreciate easiest way to explain my algorithm with pictures are from an older suboptimal my algorithm is extends the line segments around the point i across until it hits a point on the opposite there is no vertex within this it creates a new one red and connects to there one or more vertices in the it connects to the closest this produces a decomposition with the fewest number of convex in some cases it can fail in the following if it happens to connect the middle green line this will create an extra unneeded to this i propose double checking all the edges and check that they are all still if remove some this is not see this and with would yield a better in this scenario no edges to remove so this poses a in this case i suggest an order of when deciding which vertex to connect a reflex vertex it should choose the vertex with the highest closest closest reflex closest reflex that is also in range when working backwards to we can see that the reflex vertex 9 chose to connect to 12 it was when it would have been better to connect to both vertices 5 and 12 are in the range as defined by the extended line segments and but vertex 5 should be given preference because 9 is within the range given by and but not in the range given by and the edge elimates the reflex vertex at but does not eliminate the reflex vertex at but it can eliminate the reflex vertex at so 5 should be given is possible that the edge will still exist with this modified but it can be removed during there any cases by john this is missing the bits under figures 3 and vertices in are given in ccw mean that if is being compared with then is in the range given by the rays and each vertex if is find the closest point of intersection given by the ray starting at and extending in the direction of this lower repeat for the ray given by this upper if there are no vertices along boundary of the polygon in the range given by the upper and lower create a new vertex exactly half way between the lower and upper bound points and upper will lie on the same connect to this new iterate along the vertices in the range given by the lower and upper for each vertex if is a if no other good reflexes have been save it any other vertex if it is closer then the other good reflexes save if no good reflexes have been found and it is closer than the other vertices save connect to the best repeat entire algorithm for both halves of the polygon that was just no reflex vertices then is out there is one more case i algorithm will attempt to connect vertex 1 to unless i add another check to make sure it so i propose stuffing everything the onto a priority queue using the priority scheme i mentioned then take the highest priority check if it can if pop it off and use the i this makes my algorithm n log if i optimize it for a little more maybe this put together that loosely describes my i tend to move stuff so get it while to convex

really want to synchronize on an since you have control over what instances are the same and what instances are java just provide such a facility using integers in a small that is dependable across different if you really must synchronize on an then you need to keep a map or set of integer so you can guarantee that getting the exact instance you would be to create a new perhaps stored in a that is keyed by the to synchronize something like page page p if synchronized p locks new object integer return explain this it uses which allows use of you could do new then you incur the cost of creating an object for each to avoid i just save the integer itself in the what does this why is this any different from just using the integer you do a from a the keys are compared with at least the method used is the equivalent of using two different integer instances of the same value will be equal to each you can pass any number of different integer instances of as the parameter to and you will always get back only the very first instance that was passed in that contained that are reasons why you may not want to synchronize on you can get into deadlocks if multiple threads are synchronizing on objects and are thus unwittingly using the same locks when they want to use different you can fix this risk by using new and thus incurring a small cost to each access to the doing you guarantee that this class will be doing its synchronization on an object that no other class will be synchronizing always a good

recently found myself in a similar had some serialized objects that i had to the of those objects was different than the newest version in my there were a couple of different stored in the file for the same class at different so i have the luxury of modifying the class and setting its i actually had to go in and modify the stored i figured out reading the source is that an object gets serialized by first storing the class name and then immediately after using to save the solution was to catch the exception then go look for the class and immediately after the class name replace the old with the

running a fairly complex app as a portlet on websphere portal server on aix using ibm jdk on our production system i can see a strange behaviour in the verbose gc after a period of normal behaviour the system can start rapidly allocating larger and larger the system starts to spend 1000 ms to complete each but blocks are being allocated so quickly that there is only a 30 ms gap between allocation allocation failure slightly larger than the last by some integer amount x 1024 you might have 5 and then a short while later 5 mb 17 can go on for up to 10 blocks tend to grow up to 8 to 14 mb in size before it a and i assume that now spending of time doing gc with three cores waiting for the other core to complete for 10 system performance dies at this have hibernate web services log4j output and not much interpret this as likely to be something infrastructural rather than our application if it was a bad string concatenation inside a loop we would expect more irregular growth than blocks of if it was stringbuffer or arraylist growth we would see the block sizes the growth is making me think of log buffering or something i think of anything in our app that allocations even 1 let alone today i looked for logging backing up in memory before being flushed to but the volume of logging statements over this period of gc thrashing was nowhere near the mb the problem is with the excessive memory allocation rather than with the garbage which is just doing its best to keep something is allocating a large block and trying to grow it inefficiently in increments that are far too ideas what might be causing all this when the system is under anybody seen anything similar with portal for anybody interested starting to look like the cause is an occasional but enormous database it seems the culprit is either hibernate or the jdbc garbage collection behaviour with websphere portal

say you come from a cocoa background so assuming not talking about most webframeworks that say they do mvc are actually using a different pattern called front a bit of a different story from normal mvc because you need quite a lot of plumbing to make that hence all the mvc frameworks in the originally mvc was a pattern for for these applications you can make mvc work without needing a is a pattern that can be implemented in any object oriented no reason why you do it in the only reason i can think of why people would call mvc on java a approach is that the ui libraries on java like swing do not actually require you to do they just give you the tools to implement a have to create controller and model classes about what is are usually not really constructive mvc is a pattern developed for smaltalk about 30 years none of the implementations that are used now are exactly the same many implementations are got different flavours called and they are all usefull in some the important thing to take away from this is that its a good idea to separate your ui logic from your application java can do this and so can most other people claiming otherwise are probably just afraid to look outside the language comfortable

simplest way to answer your question might be to turn your question upside that the cryptoserviceprovider implementation holds all the it is just as fast and uses just as little memory as why do both implementations do we even in the at what we know about each one generates cryptographically secure random the other makes no is generating random numbers that are sufficiently random to be used in or generating numbers that simply but guarantee anything there a cost associated with generating cryptographically secure random then random number generator would do can usually assume that standard library functions are designed to do what it says on the box and do it is designed to get you the next random number in a sequence of numbers efficiently as is designed to generate random numbers strong enough to be used in and do as efficiently as if there was a way to do this as efficiently as then would use it question seems to assume brain damage on the part of the framework designers that they somehow designed a needlessly slow function to generate cryptographically secure random even though there was a faster fastest way to generate cryptographically secure random numbers is most likely to call the function designed by experts to generate cryptographically secure random

some dissent since this got bumped so some relevant bits from the research shows that the standard really define forward nor does it explicitly state that enums can or be forward from section underlying type of an is an integral type that can all the enumerator values defined the it which type is used as the underlying for an enumeration except that underlying type shall not be than int unless the value of enumerator cannot fit in an int unsigned if the is the underlying type is as the enumeration had a enumerator with value the value applied to an an object of enumeration or an is the value applied to the the underlying type of an enum is with one minor we flip to the section on which is about as close as we come to any standard on forward class that has been declared but not or an array of unknown size or of incomplete element is an object class type as might be incomplete at one point in a translation unit and complete later the type is the same type at both the declared type of an array object might be an array of incomplete class type and therefore if the class type is completed later on in the translation the array type becomes the array type at those two points is the same the declared type of an array object might be an array of unknown size and therefore be incomplete at one point in a translation unit and complete later the array types at those two points of unknown bound of and of n are different the type of a pointer to array of unknown or of a type defined by a typedef declaration to be an array of unknown cannot be the standard pretty much laid out the types that can be forward enum so compiler authors generally regard forward declaring as disallowed by the standard due to the variable size of its underlying makes enums are usually referenced in and the compiler would indeed need to know the storage size in those since the storage size is implementation many compilers may just choose to use 32 bit values for the underlying type of every at which point it becomes possible to forward declare an interesting experiment might be to try forward declaring an enum in visual then forcing it to use an underlying type greater than as explained above to see what

some more details of what environment you are using difficult to be but a few of pointers to things that can easily go wrong when setting up sure you have the camera set up to look at point you are drawing the this can be surprisingly and the simplest approach is to implement glutlookat from the opengl utility make sure you front and back planes are set to sensible off backface at least to start sure with production code backface culling gives you a quick performance but remarkably easy to set up normals incorrectly on an object and not see it because looking at the invisible to call glflush to make sure that all commands are drawing to the back buffer then failing to call glswapbuffers is also a common you can run into issues with buffer formats although if you copy from sample code that works on your system this is less likely to be a coding tends to be quite straightforward to debug once you have the basic environment correct because the output is but setting up the rendering environment on a new system can always be a bit tricky until you have that first cube or sphere i would recommend obtaining a sample or template and modifying that to start with rather than trying to set up the rendering window from using glut to check out first drafts of opengl calls is good technique

someone can comment on hashing it helps if they have at least a fundamental understanding of the underlying concepts and all of the responses so far which have focused on endless typecasting are completely but even will result in unreliable results if a unicode string is being first thing you need to understand is that hashing and encryption algorithms operate at the that means they care what hashing or you can hash plain full etc the algorithm working with the only thing you have to ensure is that the internal function of your hashing library returns an ansistring in the function which spits out your resulting all that actual code for your project can be based on normal string which maps to unicodestring in delphi you be typecasting anything to ansistring or by doing you immediately create a broken hash if and when the user tries to hash anything outside the scope of the ansi character and in the world of a broken hash is both unreliable and

suspect that this will end up being a database design issue more than a query optimization the steps to analyze this query have all been outlined to consider the logic of your you may not need to run this query nearly as many times as you are or you may find that you need the data in the same format that currently producing allowing you to write a simpler and faster going to assume that you need this query generate the execution plan for the query for a sample the include execution plan button or for portions of the the execution plan that are taking a lot of and see if you can tie those back to a specific part of the this will give us the clues on where to focus our around with these portions of the query and see what you can come up thing that i can see that might help performance on the specifics of your is to try and force the order of data access to the dettaglioorarilinee for dettaglioorarilineeperiodi select idorario from where idorario in select idorario is still an inner from periodi where 0 as as and as as select as as as as over by order by as select from dettaglioorarilineeperiodi where idrellineestazionamenti as inner select idorario from dettaglioorarilineeperiodi where idrellineestazionamenti as on inner join on select idorario from where 0 or idgiorno on or as as and as as and or not in as as idorario from as as as as as 0 or idgiorno as row thing you could try would be replacing the or not in as as idorario from as or not like and not like and not like if you find anything that or you have a bunch of the next step would be to see if you can modify the indexes for these what recommend is loading sql profiler may need to install it from your sql and creating a new as soon as the trace has execute the operation that is taking too and then stop the save the trace to a and then launch the database engine tuning load the and select the database to and press this will give you a list of focus on changes to the dettaglioorarilinee and any other table that took up a large part of the execution plan with a scan strongly advise not implementing the recommended changes straight from this instead use these recommndations as a if none of the above give you the needed performance you could look into denormalizing the table dettaglioorarilinee so that each row has the data for the a and b this is probably not a good

the general it will be faster with the some points to data on the disk is organized in surfaces tracks and it takes the disk some time to position the reading heads so that you can start reading a now you need five blocks from that you ask for then in a different order than they appear on the physical the cache will help greatly by reading the whole track into memory more blocks than you then reindex them the head starts to it probably will be on the not on the start of the first without have to wait until the first block of the track rotates under the head and start reading the time to read a track would be effectively so with a you can read the blocks of a track in any order and you start reading as soon as the head arrives over the the file system is pretty the os will start to squeeze your data into various empty imagine block 1 is on track block 2 is on track block 3 is again on track without a loose a lot of time for positioning the with a track 5 is kept in ram as the head goes to track 7 and when you ask for block you get it files need a lot of namely where the data blocks for the file in this the cache will keep this data live as you read the saving you from a lot more head cache will allow other programs to access their data in an efficient way as you hog the so overall performance will be this is very important when a second program starts to as you in this the cache will collect some writes before it interrupts your most programs read process it and then write it without the a program would either get into its own way or it would have to implement its own caching scheme to avoid head cache allows the os to reorder the disk say you have blocks on track 7 and 13 but file order asks for track 13 and then more efficient to read track 7 on the way to 13 rather than going all the way to 13 and then come back to while reading lots of data would be faster without a this is only true if your file is the only one on the disk and all is ordered the physical layout of the data is in such a way that the reading heads always start reading a track at the start of the first

there are a handful of ways to do what but a good number of them are not going to be implementation you could use locks or but they will really only work on threaded servers and probably not at all in a more or less means the locking implementation will be up to two file on your file property in your model both you have to manually set the lock object on update and check against it on try something obj if raise simultaneousupdateerror this return in models locked def def overriding save because you want to use generic probably not the best idea to rework model code to accomodate view but i like to give this creates a different critical is indeed a clumsy implementation that have to clean you may not be comfortable with the fact that a different critical region has been but i see how do much better if your using the database as an implementation without making the implementation much more option would be to make the locks entirely separate then you could update them after the method is but i feel like coding that if you really want to use a locking that would also solve the if this might be the thing for something def return def if not raise if f def raise class locked def maybe some way to mix and match these suggestions to your

thing that jumps out at me with this why are you using ints instead of a class to represent true this is a simple but a piece class seems to jump out as a fairly obvious class to with int you really have 3 presumably something you should check for 0 before bothering to check for if they are the same it will be quicker really cares this need to be and make more logical sense the square if so then do not bother checking if the squares hold the same for simple things like especially when you are just starting try to embrace it is a different way of and it takes so practice as much as you

think got a good grasp on how to handle memory in but doing it in c is different a bit got constructors and got the pretty straightforward new and delete and i know how to encapsulate it using using with smart pointers and within in c i handle malloc and free the same i know how to hide them and how to automate all i can figure is using functions for initiating and destroying my but how should i structure my memory writing this realized this is more a question about me understanding the flow of c than anything but one question at a for the answers but i need to rephrase i say that i use raii and smart pointers for i want the same for i know not the but how i handle memory allocation in is connected to these example in my classes i dynamically add and destroy the memory my class this way i can achieve a sort of i need to know the class handles it just this means i can the lower memory handling and just focus on a few i want to know is the in handling memory in there are no classes with to handle this for is it good to allocate memory in the beginning of a function or use a function that creates it for and how should i free them are broad questions and they differ from situation to situation but how do you prefer to handle what tips and lessons can you way to handle memory allocation in

way past my so i may sound quirky on this seems to me that you have things set up the wrong matching an input string against a list of you should be matching each pattern in the list against the input string and determining a it should be quite straightforward to construct an array of regex patterns by parsing the xml then you can iterate through the array and match each regex against your input why do you need wildcards at wildcards can be considered a subset of regex and so you already have all the functionality of wildcard matching encapsulated within the regex more data on the type of may prove helpful to understand your

what i you will need ruby dbi and ruby to my knowledge the ado dbd for dbi is no longer the installation below is not a comprehensive walk thru on how to get all the required moving parts like freetds installed it will also assume gem installations of both the dependent libraries and the adapter should be noted that this version of the adapter was developed using both the ancient version of dbi up to the current stable release of because later versions of dbi will be changing many it is highly recommended that you max your install to version which the examples below for the time being we are not supporting dbi versions higher than the good news is that if you were using a very old dbi with technically this adapter will still work for but be warned your path is getting old and may not be supported for gem install dbi gem install gem install update your to include the reload your by logging out and in on ubuntu server i needed to install some sudo aptitude install unixodbc sqsh freetds installed i could configure it like cat host port tds version important thing here is which is the dsn that use when connecting to the the and port are and worth noting that i had to use specifically as the tds freetds is not too sqsh acumenserver username symbol has different size in shared consider copyright scott is free software with absolutely no more information type use select top 1 lastname from row up necessary to configure cat tds driver cat odbc connection via then tested the connection with isql acumenserver username help quit use database context to sqlexecute returned returns select top 1 firstname from returns rows so got odbc using freetds to connect to a remote mssql all left is to add ruby into the sudo aptitude install last thing to test is that ruby can use dbi and odbc to hit the actual and easy to require dbh a more complete test with sql mind top 10 firstname from rec puts here fix the odbc lib being in the wrong freetds you can either edit the path in the file for the driver section or cp the into way works when accessing mssql from the found this to be then in the

while ago we started developing a new project which internally has about different that are heavily related to each other either via or then we went with a native oodbms system basically because what it allowed us to do was to take our object model and simply add a few persistence related here and there and we were ready to over time we ran into more and more really a reasonable limitations that forced us to implement slow workarounds resulting in mediocre performance and scalability issues on the horizon and license fees have almost increased by a factor of 5 for us with no change on our end got bought by big currently starting to look for a solution in terms of as well as we had a look at other and always came across major breakers for us and therefore we started to look a little further and basically are thinking about orms which hopefully let us keep most of the focus on our objects instead of wrangling with basically my does anyone have any experience with entity framework or any other orm that keeps configuration as maintainable as possible as well as performs well in related the amount of data we store is not amazing or extensive in any sort expect a total of 100k instances across all entities within the next 3 anyone have any for an orm experience migrating from an oodbms to from oodbms to orm framework sql

with all good simplified what actually trying to this is but it is worth noting that python has a of flexibility when it comes to class versus instance the same can be said of for a good list of i recommend starting especially sections 2 through thing that takes a lot of work to remember when getting started is that is not more than just a in an entire class is making the namespace resolution real any variables declared outside a method are instance if variables and are implicitly accessible within the grand rule of thumb is that there are three namespaces that are in for current are limited exceptions to the main one that occurs to me is when a class definition is being the class definition is its own implicit but this lasts only as long as the module is being and is entirely bypassed when within a class foo bar class foo def return bar recent call file line in class file line in bar file line in return global name is not the the thing to remember is that you have access to any of the variables you want to but probably not if your goals are simple and then going for or will probably be if your example is getting more or you want to do fancy things like inheritance can inherit or the idea of referring to the name of your class within the class itself seems wrong to check out the intro i

working on a reporting system that allows the user to arbitrarily query a set of fact constraining on multiple dimension tables for each fact written a class that automatically assembles all the correct joins and subqueries based on the constraint and everything works as i have a feeling that not generating the most efficient on a set of tables with a few million these queries take about 10 seconds to and like to get them down in the i have a feeling if i could get rid of the the result would be much more than show you my actual schema is much more show you an analogous example that illustrates the point without having to explain my whole application and data that i have a database of concert with artists and users can arbitrarily tag the artists and the so the schema looks like say i want to query the database for all concerts happening within one month of for all artists with and performing at concerts with and best query been able to come up with looks like as as as as as as join artist on inner join venue on in select from inner join tag as a on inner join tag as b on in select from inner join tag as a on inner join tag as b on between and interval 1 query but i like having those multiple if i could accomplish the same logic purely using join i have a feeling the performance would drastically a perfect be using a real olap but my customers will be deploying to mysql or mssql or and i guarantee that a compatible olap engine will be so stuck using an ordinary rdbms with a star get too hung up on the details of this example real application has nothing to do with but it has multiple fact tables with an analogous relationship to the ones shown in this the and tables function as fact and everything else is a important to in this that the queries are much simpler to write if i only allow the user to constrain against a single or it only gets really tricky when i allow the queries to include and requiring multiple distinct my question what are the best techniques that you know of for writing efficient queries against multiple fact best way to join multiple fact

writing some optimized c code that basically runs through an array and does something to each what it does depends on the current value of the element so something i if else if 2 else returning to c after many years working in dynamic where my practice has been to try to write straightforward code and not create lots of local variables for things that i can just refer to like am very much aware that best practices are to write readable code and trust that the compiler is smarter than you and will do good i were writing the code above in i would load into a register once and then just use that value each time because i know that is private memory and change between even a smart compiler might do a load every time because it be sure that the memory do i have to explicitly declare volatile for the compiler to not make this my question should i expect better performance by rewriting with a local variable like i val if else if 2 else does stuff like take care of this automatically for the code optimizing takes days to so even modest improvements will make a i store c array values in local variables if going to reference them

you sure you need you need to add new code when adding a new disease there is little point in making the to be data driven static will just complicate you are worried about a mismatch between the database and the you can verify that database and the constants match when starting up the you have the diseases defined in a table and are using some kind of referential integrity you do think you need a data driven you probably should not need any fields for at as the code really depend on in that case each disease should be a proper object with a identity and other you need special handling for certain types you probably should go back to an enum you instead have many diseases might be added and only a few types several diseases are handled in the same way by the same add a type in the and in the code as an enum for the and use that to run different each disease actually have a lot of it might be a good idea to try to write one class for each can then do a proper thing with and interface enum cludge is not neccesary since java as you can get both do a static import if you need when using validating the database is simpler as you get an enumeration for fields should probably be located in a class called disease or sickdude instead of a gigantic global constants for the fields in possibly as an inner public enum in the class where they

your problem was that fancy error correction mechanism prevented you from knowing that there was a syntax error in the back in 1982 or running tex on a long document would take so much time that knuth want tex to just quit when it ran into an tex tries to guess what you meant and go on typesetting the so that you can fix a bunch of errors before you run it for when it spots a command outside math it assumes that you forgot a dollar sign and inserts no automatic mechanism is so syntax errors often cause some part of text to be or typeset in a wrong does try to tell you that it has found but i suppose current ides make it easy to ignore the try running latex on the document from the command line and pay attention to what it for the short seems i forgot some dollar tex to prompt you missing it seems i forgot some dollar 2009 way of dealing with this is to type x to fix the source and run latex again but you can actually enter other commands at the prompt to edit the input that tex if you just type q run quietly same as specifying which emacs or whatever ide you are using probably does for you get a typeset document as a and it might not be obvious that there are in fact syntax errors in
