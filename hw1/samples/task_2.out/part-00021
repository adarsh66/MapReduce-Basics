am assuming that when you make the call to execute the query you have the and you receive the so at that point you have it seems like you could do your analysis maybe catching things further what you might do is on your own custom subclass of add a triggeringsqlstatement member with a getter and and then at the place where you attempt to execute the catch the original exception from create a new set the triggeringsqlstatement to be the statement you just and call on the databaseexception to set the exception caught from postgresql as the cause of your then throw your databaseexception and the calling code which catches it will have an object that prints out a very decent stack trace of what happened plus provides access to the sql statement that caused the for more information on this you might want to research java exception even if you use all of what i just i think you should definitely be using java exception chaining not a spot anywhere in the code where you have access to both the sql statement that caused the problem and the exception that gets be very curious as to and how that is and suggest you redesign your code so that you do have such a since wanting to see the sql statement first thing in the you could probably also override your method other appropriate not sure what gets called when an exception is printed to print out the included sql assuming you included it as i described

an excellent book that is not as widely but is full of deep software the cooperative by alistair so special about clearly everyone has heard the term and it seems most are believers these whether you believe or there are some deep principles behind why the agile movement this book uncovers and articulates these principles in a scientific some of the principles are these are my not hardest thing about team software development is getting brains to have the same we are building complex systems which are invisible in the tangible the better you are at getting more brains to share deeper the more effective your team will be at software is the underlying reason that pair programming makes most people dismiss it i did too but with this principle in mind i highly recommend that you give it another you wind up with two people who deeply understand the subsystem you just built there many other ways to get such a deep information transfer so it is like a vulcan mind always need words to communicate deep understanding and a too many and you exceed the meaning the understanding transfer attempting does not consider that children learn how to speak language by being and not just language either he gives the example of some kids playing with trains on the along comes another kid who has never even a train before but by watching the other he picks up the gist of the game and plays right this happens all the time between this along with the corollary about too many words helps you see how misguided it was in the old days to try to write 700 page detailed requirements is so much more in there shut up but i highly recommend this

an interesting going to address concepts around the question rather than answer the question directly i know that much about gcc probably already explored some manipulation of the source code to achieve what you want to some kind char return with with a macro on the function if looking for a compiler then you probably want to modify are some gcc extensions discussed that sound a bit like what going if gcc has anything that does what you probably be documented in the area of the i find anything that sounded exactly like what but perhaps since you understand best what looking know better how to find gdb script would do a pretty good job of outputting but it sounds like got bigger plans than simply doing inserting significant logic into the code seems to be what reminds me of some dynamic linker tricks come across library could insert code around function calls without affecting the original the example encountered was on but there is probably an analog on other came across the option documented instrumentation calls for entry and exit to just after entry and just before function the following profiling functions will be with the address of the current function and its call some does not work beyond the current so the call information may not be available to the profiling functions void void void void i guess this work because you are not able to modify the return value from the profiling

an using the stl spits reams of incomprehensible and compiler reason for this is essentially if you use templates stl you will get of error so if you implement your own template based collection classes you will not be in any better could make non template based containers and store everything as void pointers or some base class but you would lose compile time type checks and sucks as a dynamic it is not as safe to do this as it would be in python or one of the reasons being that does not have a root class for all classes to all introspection on all objects and some basic error handling at instead your app would likely crash and burn if you were wrong about the type and you would not be given any clues to what went

another thread were to check the variable i believe it to quirks in the memory see a partially initialized the new of java memory model means that any fields should be set to their values before the object becomes visible to other threads long as the reference to the newly created object escape from the constructor in any other but beyond that there many share data without appropriate locking guarantees given by static inializers memory models are seriously as is programming in try to avoid this becoming a terms the assignment happens the constructor runs so if you observe the variable the same it will be null during the constructor as i say there are memory model for the purposes of you can get away with this your field is and using java 5 or prior to java 5 the memory model strong enough for you need to get the pattern right see effective 2nd item 71 for more my reasoning for arguing against inlining being visible in a single suppose we class public static foo f public static void f new make this nested if you i believe it affects the class public boolean public fwasnull believe this will report from three steps are the operand is evaluated to produce a if this evaluation then the expression completes abruptly for same the operand not evaluated and no the operand is if evaluation completes the assignment expression abruptly for the same reason and assignment the value of the operand is converted to the type the is to value set conversion the appropriate standard value an value and the result of the conversion stored into the from actions can be ordered by a if one action then the first is visible to and ordered before the we have two actions x and we write to indicate that x x and y are actions of the same thread and x comes before y in program then is a edge from the end of a constructor of an object to the start of a finalizer for that an action x a following action then we also have and then should be noted that the presence of a relationship between two actions does not necessarily imply that they have to take place in that order in an if the reordering produces results consistent with a legal it is not other okay for weird stuff to happen even within a single thread that be in this case the difference be which is why i believe it would be

answer for your revised what is happening is that the sql server query optimiser is optimising out your it is performing a single scan of the test and combining the inner and outer where clauses into why you get the error to see view the estimated execution plan for the and hover over the clustered index scan icon to see what is actually being carried you will see the following predicate being applied on the regardless of the structure of your it is trying to do the on every row in the avoid use a table variable or temporary table that be optimised table myvalint as myvalint results set you actually want to return will be so suggest storing the primary key along with the int value in the table and then doing your final query as a join like table id myvalint as inner testtable on	
answer is correct but the key point is buried deep enough that bring it out as a separate your types in this specific case the compiler accepted an array of integer but only because that has a special meaning and what you any other attempt to define a type in the definition would simply have if you want two things to be assignment compatible you have to declare them as being the not merely two types that are built the a array of b array of a array4 array of a b a the compiler does what you would

anyone here ever built or maintained a third what steps did you take to get can you really to throw one in been brought in a few times to cleanup second systems gone steps i took are to be frank the system built by experts note that calling baby and you are not liked for doing we throwing one throwing away the ineffective software in note that saying that the previous software is a not an you are not liked for doing been brought in other times to build a working every design goes through all three understand the problem domain the the first system is a it has problem domain kluges technical the first system always has some management declares puts it into production and users hate it because the problem domain developers hate it because of the technical in a few i have continued on past the initial klugy the real work fix the problem domain kluges dig out the lies the users find the business and stupid fix the technical requires which requires unittests so that you can that the problem domain kluges are the most users say just a simple of the when really not a copy but a second users say give me a and then turn that into a magical key that does everything away the problem domain stuff is it takes a while for users to wrap their head around what they lobby for of the process the users realize they their business or their relationships or their when the third system can in one case continued on to this level of problem domain discarding a bunch of problem domain and arrive at a view of what really simpler than the second system and have the crap workaround in the first we threw away two business this appear costly just analysis and but really the old and plans and are now laughable because so and we threw away previous software using a lot of so it very painful to stop using one component and start using

are a number of things that most frameworks although the definition is a basic bootstrapper setup check for compatability issues between php routing how to define rules for which urls point to which orm manipulate objects instead of writing sql queries usually involves creating a for template logic to avoid having php code in the template most frameworks also include a slew of libraries from simple to advanced web service would recommend two frameworks to look recommend this because a framework that works out of the it also has a great lots of 3rd party ci has a bit of trickery to get the framework to play nice with both php4 and which is also good to know for some a lot of people still use you should also take a look at which is a branch of codeigniter that has been rewritten as a strict php5 is a instead of dropping everything in a directory and churning out you pick the parts you need and glue them together since zend is made by the folks behind the engine behind php it uses latest and of php5 everything is and it uses type very clean if a bit think the essential stuff is the bootstrapper for the as well as how each framework implements a system to support libraries and the rest you can find as applications

are absolutely correct when you say that ui is time costly and error great compromise i have found is as realized that a lot of data not can be presented using a simple table as a rather than continuously try to create custom panels and fancy it seem obvious at but quite usable and visually is it so because i was able to create a reusable framework which can accept a collection of concrete models and with little to no effort can render all these models within the so much its adding a toolbar above the my framework can add remove from or edit entries in the using the full power of i can hide and sort as needed by extending various classes only this is find myself reusing a heck of a lot of code every time i want to display and manage new i make extensive use of icons rows or to beautify the i use large icons as a window header to make each screen different and appealing and it always looks like new and different but its always the same code behind lot of work and effort was required at first to do the but now its paying off big can write the gui for an entirely new application with as many as 30 to 50 different consisting of as many screens in a fraction of the time it would take me using the ui would recommend you evaluate and explore this

are three approaches commonly taken in building a chat applet either find or build a java applet that communicates to a chat the applet can be an irc or a chat client with a custom even seen some websites use a java applet as a communication where the interface is all run by javascript and html in the but the javascript sends and accepts events from the applet to run the every time a use writes a send the message to the http where all the users connected are periodically polling for new using mainly each client establishes a connection to an http and when a message is being sent from the it is send over the already and instead of polling for new messages from other users just flow down the same i find the 3rd option to be the most but the most complex as you will probably need to build your own version of an http server to support the connection that comet and since a 16bit limit on the descriptors of sockets in be limited to about 64k per on your each client will need a open the techniques for building comet code are wildly different between there exist a few frameworks for but have to maintain them while new browsers come running a small and you want to face a surmountable then just go with ajax not too and learn a if you be then just find a java once configured with a matching never have to worry about maintaining since that solution is very of it requires that the java runtime environment be installed on the and not always going to be

asked a question about interfaces previously and got some excellent really excited to start developing really flexible now have a question about overriding a virtual am currently working with the community server one of the controls is a bread so it will list the on the relevant am using tags to allow adminstrators to target specific spots for content to appear in a however those tags are not relevant to the end for tag is used to target the main panel on the home but i want user to see i have the sdk for community i found the control which renders the and made modifications to it that do what i want however my understanding is that not good to modify the core for many what like to do is create my own which is essentially almost identical to the base but override one is the public virtual string of there is code to format the and like to write my own code which does all of the same except checks a configuration file for to my understanding is that i create my deriving from the base control and i can write my own method is that only need to change one aspect of but does this mean i have to copy the original code for that method from the base class and change what i need to in it just feel right copyign code from one but i know of another way to extend the method without changing code in the base for any to override a method in another

asking for seems to be basically a graph distance algorithm data computed from a set of pairwise a reasonable nicely metric is can be thought of construct a graph where each node is a and each edge represents the relevancy of the nodes it connects to each now imagine that starting at some node in the graph and randomly jumping to other nodes along defined say that the probability of jumping from skill a to skill b is proportional to the relevancy of those skills to each other by the relevancy of those to other skills now the commute time represents the average number of steps it takes to make it from skill a to skill has a very nice property that adding more paths between two nodes makes the commute time if skill a and b and c and and d and a are then the commute time between a and c will get shorter commute time can be computed quite easily using an eigenvalue decomposition of your sparsely connected skill graph think the reference i gave you shows but if not there are many you want to actually store the commute time between any pair of skills need a or nxn matrix is the number of a far nicer is as stated drop all connections weaker than some then store a sparsely connected graph as rows in a and i hope this

autoincremented identity columns have a when used in a restful web working on my first mvc application and trying to keep my urls there is no separate administrative web site for the i use attributes to control who can access what parts of the site and what menu items are visible to the current user based on their roles in the i follow the activerecord db pattern and use synthetic ids for my including the user with the ids being autogenerated identity occurred to me this morning that there is a subtle security risk to using default seeds for identity columns in a restful if you assume that administrative particularly the most powerful are typically created first in an then it follows that they will be the lowest numbered ids in the while not actually opening a hole in the using default values for the could make it easier for a cracker to attack a high value target simply by targeting low numbered ids using restful actions as changepassword which is one of the actions in the mvc site i add setting a seed at my users table to my arsenal of security best is the effect of doing this worth or am i being too as a related should i be changing the template names for columns and security in a restful web

basic rules are actually fairly where it gets tricky is in how they apply to your cache works on two temporal locality and spatial former is the idea that if you recently used a certain chunk of probably need it again the latter means that if you recently used the data at address probably soon need address cache tries to accomodate this by remembering the most recently used chunks of it operates with cache typically sized 128 byte or so even if you only need a single the entire cache line that contains it gets pulled into the so if you need the following byte already be in the this means that always want your own code to exploit these two forms of locality as much as jump all over do as much work as you can on one small and then move on to the and do as much work there as you simple example is the 2d array traversal that answer if you traverse it a row at a reading the memory if you do it read one then jump to a completely different location start of the next read one and jump and when you finally get back to the first it will no longer be in the same applies to jumps or branches mean less efficient cache usage not reading the instructions but jumping to a different of small probably change anything only skipping a few so still end up inside the cached but function calls typically imply that jumping to a completely different address that may not be unless it was called cache usage is usually far less of an issue what you usually need to worry about is the data a struct or all members are laid out which is in an all entries are laid out contiguously as in linked each node is allocated at a completely different which is pointers in general tend to point to unrelated which will probably result in a cache miss if you dereference if you want to exploit multiple it can get really as only one cpu may have any given address in its l1 cache at a so if both cores constantly access the same it will result in constant cache as fighting over the

been thinking about using formal methods to help clarify the requirements for the tool for both my client and the few developers have formal methods the only time seen clients with formal methods training were members of the zug when we were porting to formal methods i mean some form of possibly something some of the things read about and are considering include z state uml with extensions such as petri and some stuff like contracts and pre and post is there anything else i should a very large gap between which is a formal taking its basis in set and which is a informal notation with some notations tagged technical such as expect to find using a software requirements are quite comfortable with may be value creating a z model of your and there may be value in creating a model of your messaging between client and server but i find pi is both simpler and more a z model of your domain would give is an implementation independent set of type expressed more powerfully than the type system of any common implementation a formal model of your messaging would give you is the facility to run analyses to ensure you lose updates or get conflicts or a uml model gives you is a notation for breaking a large system up into function areas of showing how classes in those areas relate to each other statically of showing how instances of those classes relate dynamically activity and interaction and showing how the packages are deployed and deployment these are useful for communication in the and to get ideas fleshed out a but have formally defined semantics which allows very sophisticated z specialists i worked with in the considered the idea of specifying a case gui in z creating a uml model for such a gui is used formal pre and post though i do sometimes add them in and frequently in and i unit test conditions which might violate

can put the implications into two first is how it affects your application using unsafe code requires that your assembly be run in a full trust not possible to run in a restricted environment such as certain click once security the reason being that unsafe code prevents the clr from ensuring type click once though with no security restrictions should not have a second is what it means for the way you using unsafe code typically involves using pointers and in using them to performed advanced marshalling via there is nothing inherently wrong with either of these actions it just requires significantly more understanding of the clr and marshalling than code object pinning is a great example of knowledge need to have a firm grasp on before you started using these

can share a socket between two processes in linux and even linux posix type using will cause the forked child to have copies of all the file any that it does not close will continue to be and example with a tcp listening can be used to new sockets for this is how many including apache in most windows the same thing is basically except there is no system call so the parent process will need to use createprocess or something to create a child process can of course use the same and needs to pass it an inheritable a listening socket an inheritable handle is not a completely trivial activity but not too tricky needs to be used to create a duplicate handle in the parent process which will have the inheritable flag set on then you can give that handle in the startupinfo structure to the child process in createprocess as a out or err handle you want to use it for anything the mdsn library it appears that wsaduplicatesocket is a more robust or correct mechanism of doing it is still nontrivial because the processes need to work out which handle needs to be duplicated by some ipc mechanism this could be as simple as a file in the answer to the original multiple processes cannot just the original parent process would call the child processes would just process requests by

classic pool processes the requests in the app pool by using seperate processing pipelinesfor iis and integrated uses an integrated iis and takes advantage of the improved features of iis using only the one practise is to create a new application pool for each then configure sepeerately according to application follows the steps below incoming http request is received through the iis request is processed through request is processed through request passes back through request passes back through the iis core where the http response finally is incoming http request is received through the iis core and appropriate handler executes the request and delivers the http the session timeout in as increasing this causes the application to consume more eg

design is like any other kind of your understanding grows and with better understanding comes an evolving wish it were easier to explain how there in a conceptual basis for relational database schema the only tool that really models it is object role which has been a long time the most familiar tool was to get a flavor of here are a couple links to and but the conclusion one would draw is that assertions lead directly to a specific relational logical hence the schema will need to change as your conceptual model your rdbms can handle quite a bit of flexing if really comfortable with transformation and worth it to get good at i think that sql avoidance techniques like linq and models will just be an impediment to an evolving i may be some reason to hope that entity framework will encompass object role but only seen oblique references to the	
design you are describing seems to be pretty much in line with the a lot of smaller components is also generally considered to be good solid principles would generally accept the denormalization describing in the and would rather focus on letting each external of such a component have its own think the main problem you have is that spending too much time wondering how to these you should probably be looking at a dependency injection framework to handle like then just construct the object in its full state and not worry about all the dependencies not being used for every

drawing offscreen to a created using then later generating a from it with and drawing that onto my view in also drawing some other stuff on top of that this is an exercise in isolating different levels of variability and all works fine when all running on the main however one of the motivations for splitting this out this way was so that the offscreen part could be run on a background thread i had thought should be ok since not rendering to an onscreen when i do this the resulting image is checked over the and placed judicious to verify that everything is happening in the right next step is to boil this down to the simplest code that reproduces the issue find some silly thing missing and fix at which point have some code to post here if but i first wanted to check here that not going down the wrong path with i find anything in my travels around the googlesphere that sheds light either way but a friend did mention that he ran into a similar issue while trying to resize images in a background thread suggesting there may be some general limitation for the responses so if nothing else they have told me that at least not alone in not having an answer for this which was part of what i wanted to find at this point going to put the extra work into getting the simplest possible example and may come back with some code or more in the meantime keep any ideas coming point to bring a couple of people have used the term with respect to it should be noted that there are two types of thread safety in this of the api itself ie can it be used at all from more than one thread state and other issues such as strtok are common reasons that an api might not be thread safe of individual operations can multiple threads interact with the same objects and resources through api without application level suspect that mention so far has been of the first but would appreciate if you could i got it all executive summary is that the problem was with rather than bitmap contexts my background just before i drew into the bitmap i was doing some preparation on some other it turns out the calls to those other objects where leading to setneedsdisplay being called on some separating the part that did that out to the main thread it now all works for anyone who hits this question wondering if they can draw to a bitmap context on a background the answer is you can the caveats that have been presented here and in the core can you draw to a bitmap context from a background

everything described your best bet would be to use the datalist you can specify how many columns wide you want things to be by using the repeatcolumns property and you an even eliminate any sense of by setting the repeatlayout property to will also allow you to not worry about column counting and you could even bind a collection of images for since you requested an it would be as simple as first create your grid and make sure to have a placeholder for the in your code all you would have to do is a simple data not sure how your images are but for the sake of say you had a database query that gave you the urls to each image you wanted to your page load would look something like dtimageurls this is where folks will differ on i prefer to do all my rowbinding type methods in code as opposed to so i then consume the rowdatabound event of my datalist and simply bind the url property protected void image targetimage datarow datasourcerow datasourcerow targetimage that should get you up and note you would need to change your datasourcerow object to whatever type of item you were databinding i was using a datarow since that is the most common scenario i usually

fact that this method is securitycritical instead of securitysafecritical is likely an artifact of the fact that at one point the desktop version framework version demanded environmentpermission to get at this since relaxed the demand on the desktop side so it really does make sense for this to be safecritical on raised this as an issue we should fix in a future release of siverlight and it looks like be able to do you find more cases where there are public methods that feel like they should be safecritical instead of critical in do file some feedback at real people do look at these issues and your best bet for letting us know about your pain now it looks like have to go with the workaround provided but at some point fix the security annotation has been fixed in silverlight

have a design conundrum that i could use some feedback so hoping my fellow sharepoint experts can help me work this am managing a set of projects in a single moss list where the column will be treated as a least in my for related each project will have associated with it a set of defined deliverables to 37 separate activities throughout each and each deliverable will track one significant activity that is recommended to complete during the initial thinking was to define the 37 deliverables in a separate so that each deliverable had not just a but linking to a separate where the user can find more info on how to accomplish the to give a quick explanation of what the deliverable means having to send the user off to a separate server to get any to help us filter and sort the deliverables into the order in which required to be to identify the primary project role that owns completion of the i would create individual items in another list each of which was associated with the project and the item in the lookup so that we could track additional these date when deliverable was finished a from which the user can choose states such as or in text to record more on what was done and one major problem with this approach is that best practices guidance strongly discourages moss lists with 2000 items in the even if we never added more deliverables to each afraid that scale beyond 54 projects how many in very short creating multiple instances of list3 is theoretically but strikes me as a nightmare to automate my set of tracked projects first alternative i can think of is to 37 additional columns in the projects plus the x columns needed to enable the and fields that the users will need to track for each plus having to manage a brittle of each of the spd forms web part pages that like to use to the ui for all this data entry data alternative someone suggested to me is to create for each and list the deliverables in a single list in the seems awfully heavyweight to and considering this only as my last would any of you pull this off in moss relying on an outside or any code that would have to be installed to the is there some trick to making this that obvious from the usual moss list is there some hidden feature of moss i should some neat aspect of sharepoint designer i discovered i to believe that many others have faced this same and have figured out way to make it appreciate any ideas you folks can suggest thanks in which would you choose additional or a separate linked

have a site an application that creates mail merges or based on a couple of user it can generate cartesian joins worth of data without a but in comes the needs of enterprise to make life a bit more have to build the application so after verifying zip codes of remote it creates emails to media targets based on how far from that employee the media target say for instance employees are well known volunteers where they the enterprise wants to email media within a 5 mile radius of these employees a message about the work the employee is this is where things get i have several choices which i will outline the attempts and the largest radius is 20 i create a database table that holds records of every zip code in the joined to every zip code within 20 miles of that zip the dataset looks something like names are different this is for the sake of as an ny has 350k records from the above dataset other states are average load time on that 6 not i verified this by setting it is during the stage that the disconnect one was never implemented due to a logistics i make a database connection for each employee zip to media target zips with a distance of x or except that the source files and the media targets combined can reach upwards of 34k individualized 34k db even if i could devise a way to reuse zip code i did some test checks in the db and found that there are 500 distinct zip codes in ny where employees 500 db i doubt that would work but i could be latest scheme to get around the problem is in that hoping the web server runs a better game then the dataset object by getting a new dataset looks doing a distance formula to figure out if the data this relies heavily on the processors on the web is this a worthwhile or will i find the same load time damage on this attempt as there a better appreciate any even if it confirms my fears that this project might not i have control of the and running sql2k programming the site in visual studio framework might get upgraded to sql2005 and vs2008 within the next few months dataset to long load time

have found that one of the best investments i ever made in avoiding deadlocks was to use a object relational mapper that could order database the exact order is not as long as every transaction writes in the same order deletes in exactly the reverse reason that this avoids most deadlocks out of the box is that your operations are table a then table then table c perhaps depends on table can achieve a similar result as long as you exercise care in your stored procedures or data access the only problem is that it requires care to do it by whereas a orm with a unit of work concept can automate most a delete should run forward to verify that everything is the version you expect still need record version numbers or and then delete backwards once everything as this should all happen in one the possibility of something changing out from under you the only reason for the orm doing it backwards is to obey the key but if you do your check you will have all the locks you need already in

have seen two solutions to this kind of the first is to try to use characteristics to define subordinate products to the the challenge here is that in addition to your thoughts for in most cases the product will evolve with new manufacturers that bring new aspects to the for one manufacturer may make a cheaper but have a different application method for the logo or stitching that may be significant enough to think that carrying a non significant product number for each product and then attaching the characteristics as attributes works out the it is easily searched and if a group of products are strongly a productgroup that the individual products attach to works advantages here are that you can easily query for specific attributes are in that more can be added old ones if you started with but then added another to the color you can change them to and can control price and inventory are at the detail product level more tables may be required to account for all assumes that your characteristics are universally if they are your characteristic subtable approach can work by creating a join table between characteristics and the product detail tables and populate as this will require more business logic ensure each product category gets characteristics this latter case i would use products in the base product table qty and cost of that i would clone the characteristics from and then adjust as each new product is as you move when a new variation having a this function that allows you to just adjust the from the base product would be as far as managing the inventory and this is going to happen at the ui being able to generate queries for related products and manage all the pricing for related products will go a long way to making this

have the following bit of code that i have used in the past to export a dataset generated from the stored procedure to dim c as long for each dc as datacolumn in c dim i as long for each dr as datarow in c for each dc as datacolumn in c i am trying to this code an different but similar i am running into an the previous use of this code was used on a static table in our dbase generated by the stored and while this basically remains the same for the new the requirements now require the stored procedure to have an input parameter to be entered by the user prior to for a little you can follow that completed process here a parameter into stored application itself does in fact return a fully populated and like our users to have the ability to export that generated dataset to i set up your prototypical button to do start the dirty raising the excel opens and my column names are being reiterated throughout the and here is the the cells representing the row data are have come to the conclusion do admit that i may be wrong in this that the rows are not being populated due to the fact that the stored procedure needs an input parameter to do and without that parameter there any data to return for each basically meaning that my code just work for what i am trying to i am right in my any ideas as to how i might get that parameter into my code above so that the rows will be properly i am any input on what be wrong with my logic or the code itself would be greatly is the code that generates the dim fbconn as dim myconnectionstring as myconnectionstring myserver mypassword fbconn new dim fbcmd as new dim fbadapter as new dim dsresult as new dim recordcount as recordcount catch ex as was an error in generating the check the system credentials and try the problem please contact your friendly it end kindly suggests that i offer a bounty to anyone answering my since i have enough rep to create a sufficient bounty does my gratitude garner any coding few quick tested my application by altering the stored procedure to inject the results into a new separate and then run my excel export against that table and it works since many people will be using the application at the same this is not a viable i am back to believing that there is an issue with this instance of the dataset needing a parameter to run correctly for the to answer any and all questions to the best of my dataset to

have the right you call your request gets queued on the main run so if the main thread is executing somewhere else at the time that processing will finished once your main thread code returns back to the run loop the request from the background thread can be looked at and know what determines the priority if there are other events queued for the run loop to process but in general i think you can rely on it even being the next thing is another reason you should try and keep your main thread sequential processing to a minimum try not to have long running sequences on the main thread but probably why using a background thread in the first

implementation is for a few your method should have a single purpose to call right you are putting far too much logic in and not actually of the single idisposable resource you you do not need a finalizer at since you do not directly own or allocate any unmanaged the only resource that you are disposing of is a which is and will implement its own finalizer as if you want to trap and find the cases where a connection was not disposed i would set up a finalizer to warn of that the finalizer in idisposable is meant to handle the case where the gc must do the cleanup because the caller forgot to call in your the finalizer will take care of that for part of the idisposable pattern as suggested in the design guidelines from microsoft states that the client should be able to call multiple times with no there should be nothing using the socket directly after the first call to in i would suggest that should call or as and immediately set to prevent this from being a with your current it is very possible to have the calls in cause the socket to throw an exception on subsequent calls to which should be a strong suggestion to have a method on all resources that use a or other should call there should be checks for use of the any method on the connection used after disposal should throw an

is not directly an answer to your but i have some experience using random access for blobs in and i advise you against using if you break the sql query format if your blob data needs any kind of it will certainly at some point need whatever mechanism you have in place to deal with filtering in sql will be useless in this with binary blobs wrapped in databases opposed to binary data in raw files limits your you will not be able to randomly read and write to data at the same time from multiple which is possible with you use any tool that deals with this data and provides only a file you truncate or resize the files are simply a lot more may seem convenient to have everything contained within one as it simplifies backup and but the pain of working with blobs is simply not worth as your i advise you to write your blobs as raw files to the file and merely store a reference to the filename in your if your blobs are rather small and guaranteed not to forget my

lets take his arguments one by property may be field access is readable and is a win for since you have more control of property method may throw field access never an this is mostly you can very well call a method on a not initialized object and have an exception a property cannot be passed as out or ref parameter to a field a property method can take a time to field access completes can also take very little if called multiple times in a property method may return a value each a field returns same value each how do you know the value has not changed by another class has readonly now property that returns current date and each time query this it will return different this is a and microsoft wishes that they fix the class by making now a instead of a it is a mistake a minor a property method may observable side field never in other a user a type should be able to set properties defined by a type in order he or she chooses noticing any different behavior in a property method may additional memory or return reference to something that is actually part of the so modifying the returned object no effect on the original querying a field always returns reference to an object that guaranteed to be part of the working with property that returns a copy can very confusing to and characteristic is frequently of the protestations could be said for getters and setters too we had them for quite a while without such problems in think most of the problems could be solved by better syntax highlighting differentiating properties from so the programmer knows what to

look all that to since lots of languages have anything corresponding to the preprocessing reasonably accurate for a seem to be confusing virtual address space with disk file an adjunct to physical and works the same way for it uses the but not in the same way as using a know how physical memory virtual memory is a way of faking a larger memory in a way usually the file is divided into and the pages are read in from the disk as physical memory is divided into and the physical memory address have anything to do with the virtual address currently if the program uses more memory than is physically page frames will have to be so the contents of the page frame will have to be written back changed from when it was and a new page the program uses only part of its address space at a time and that part is few enough pages so they can all sit in physical memory at this works if constantly referring to more pages than can fit in physical pages constantly have to be read in from the disk performance drops and the disk is under constant when i have compiled and linked a an executable file on the in the file when i execute it gets assigned an address and then it gets more loaded into and how much physical and how much virtual memory is irrelevant to the user that if it have enough physical going to run awfully it is possible to run a 512m program with 256m of physical memory is requested from the it is assigned to memory at least the c and standard require that it be unless the request so looks to me to be an odd choice of it have to be in physical memory until

looks like a compiler problem in the standard says overloadable declarations that differ only in the presence or absence of const volatile are that the const and volatile for each parameter type are ignored when determining which function is being or there are modifiers that can participate in as the standard mentions shortly the const and volatile at the outermost level of the parameter type specification are ignored in this const and volatile buried within a parameter type specification are significant and can be used to distinguish overloaded function

maybe one of the few people here old enough to remember one of the big reasons why one return was pushed so so the compiler can emit more efficient for each function the compiler typically pushes some registers on the stack to preserve their this the function can use those registers for temporary when the function those saved registers have to be popped off the stack and back into the one pop mov instruction per if you have a bunch of return then either each one has to pop all the registers makes the compiled code or the compiler has to keep track of which registers might have been modified and only pop those code but increasing compilation reason why it still makes sense today to try to stick with one return statement is ease of automated if your ide supports refactoring a range of lines and turning them into a very difficult to do this if the lines you want to extract have a return statement in especially if returning a

mentioned private static methods are often useful for organizing logic and repeated surprised that i noticed any mention of performance in this from renaud final word on private static methods are implicitly a final method is only implemented in the declaring there is no need to dynamically dispatch a call to a final and static invocation can be used the compiler can emit a direct call to the bypassing entirely the usual virtual method invocation because of final methods are also candidates for inlining by a compiler or a similar optimization methods are already therefore always considered for this out the whole

never had a problem with interpreting oracle error part of the reason is that every interactive tool seen for developing sql for oracle helpfully points to the location the query went that includes as others have and the perl dbi from prepare table or view does not exist error possibly near indicator at char 14 in from statement from at line that a bit hard to read since all squished on one but a gui tool would be able to point to the token where oracle started having problems with the and given a bit of work on a you could write a tool to pick out the offending answer the underlying oracle errors seem to be designed to work the way you as far as i can none of the the error messages in oracle support variable oracle returns two bits of an error number and a location where the error if you have proper pretty easy to diagnose an error with those pieces of it can be argued that system is nicer to tool creators than one which provides variable amounts of diagnostic data depending on the imagine having to write a custom parser for all of error messages future to highlight the offending including the table name would be just knowing where things went wrong can be a huge select from where dummy from where dummy at line invalid table for why oracle chose to do thing this i have some used this style of error message for system which larry bob miner and ed oates copied to build oracle number and location are the smallest possible representation of diagnostic i indicated to simplify the creation of tools that connect to any i think you need to be a dba to figure out which table you just need to use the proper adjust your i

not but the problem could be related to the list instance the element manifest of the feature you can define the attribute which have to point to the feature which contains the list definition to use when the list instance is here a two possible sources of this featureid the feature assumes that the list definition is defined within the same feature instance if you have two separated features for the definition and the instance this might lead to this i already said the featureid has to be the guid of the feature defining the list definition to perhaps you replaced this guid with a newly generated assuming that this not the featureid of the list definition but the identifier for the list instance itself when it is created within never had this problem so i could only guess what the reason for your error might this might help you on your further

not familiar with google protocol but my interpretation of the documentation if the value cannot be if the value is pretty much as likely to be negative as not some fuzzy definition of likely to if the value could be but much less likely than the value being positive if the application sometimes uses to indicate an error or value and this is a relatively uncommon what the docs have to say about the encodings is an important difference between the signed int types and and the int types and when it comes to encoding negative if you use or as the type for a negative the resulting is always ten bytes long it treated like a very large unsigned if you use one of the signed the resulting uses zigzag which is much more encoding maps signed integers to unsigned integers so that numbers with a small absolute value have a small encoded value it does this in a way that back and forth through the positive and negative so that is encoded as 1 is encoded as is encoded as and so it looks like even if your use of negative numbers is as long as the magnitude of the numbers passing in the protocol is on the smaller you might be better off using if profiling would be in

not much that needs to be you can just enable and there will be build errors but not a huge is a decision that should be taken once you cross the threshold you sacrifice a few performance gets a lot especially you cannot incrementally link a additional loading layer is added to your or you have to be careful about the order of especially with this got a lot better staring with vs2005 but there are still i have a dll project that does not unload correctly and i have not been able to figure out one symptom of such issues is that you get the detection dumpon exit from you add functionality to the you have the choice of managed or native if you choose to go managed for something that is done native elsewhere in the you have to do i go revise the older the threshold has performance and debugging handling gets more than flipping the switch on an entire i recommend a much more targeted keep your large library create a bootstrapper this provides the benefit of access to your native library while maintaining the native stability and you have dialogs see in your native library it can be tricky to wire up the but it will be worth

not sure about a hash function that does exactly what you are asking but it seems that a structure similar to how git stores its revisions might do what you need was inspired by how monotone stored its computes the sum of each of the files in the these are used as blob it then has a which maps filenames to blob ids other for the identifier of a tree is its its not relevant to your i the trees are then referred to by which include things like and one or more parent means that you have to the sum for each blob as you update you just recompute the for the blob that and recompute the for the could do the same with your compute the hash of each of your and put all your mappings into one and compute the hash of if the file containing is too big for you to want to it each you could divide it into and have a where each section had one level of branching should generally be sufficient for most but you can build a tree structure out of these if you really need

not sure if the but when i did this put it in a i expected the user to preview and the data during just single session so the session was enough for you want you preview to persist on your users machine you should use a cookie that means the user have to the preview during single but can close the browser between this and than return back to the preview in next using this you have to consider that user can deny cookies in his why people usually combine sessions with cookies the data in a database a status is not necessary unless you want to track and store the previews and edit operations you can imagine the database as a drawer in your table you put there papers with whatever you want to store and find if just drawing a preview and after the result is only a final version is stored in a and the preview is crumpled and thrown than you put this in but if for some reason you think you will later go through the then they have to be stored in a not sure if clear with my but i did my best

not sure the question is windows go out to the mapped network share to read the necessary code page in from disk or will it make a copy of it locally when first code must be in local memory to be a page fault on a network mapped drive will cause network to fetch the appropriate which will be loaded into local memory and then this since the image exists on a remote share assuming the page fault handler must go out to the network share to retrieve the code is this the page fault handler know the drive is network it will issue a file system the network mapping driver will intercept that and convert it into a network so the page fault handler is just doing its normal it know doing voodoo in the have an application running in this manner and periodically it seems to the system but the system becomes responsive after a short period of sometimes just a few seconds and in other cases this system also has a lot of and dlp products installed on it and thus several tdi filter drivers and file system filter drivers which seemingly would add to the latency in processing the page fault especially if the code must be paged in from a process image that exists on a remote with that much kernel hacking stuff on it my first thought is that your windows installation is simply stuff is poison to windows and you seem to have a ton of stuff jacked into the kernel you are for and it seems trouble has come explanations are most given the amount of badware you have most likely windows is just you need a deeper technical

now programmers think of source code control as integrating packets of but why not make those packets smaller and integrate would say dvcs are already basically doing this not because they are but because commiting is so much with git i commit far more often than with it also makes it simple to commit or specific of code add or and is generally much more focused on tracking lines of rather than complete files like the way git inherently works as you changes would be saved as checked of when you the changes are then you push them to the remote machine with a separate you could commit every time you then rebase them into a single commit if you for a tool that does version you could do this quite simply with a shell something 1 git add git commit at sleep is a which does something watches a specific and commits all the changes to a standalone git use just not sure why want to do i find one of the most useful things about using a vcs is the diff of what changed the last it seems like having commits would just be the text has an interesting it visualises the undo with there is a on with

on if you plan on relying on a centralized server or you have no when a client comes he broadcasts its asking for other clients to send centralized a new client he registers to the server and downloads the list of each client is then notified through a duplex contract if using or through basic socket of the new first version would be based on udp notice that this does not work out of the local network as i believe those packets will not pass through it is also probably a bad design because a large number of clients will just swamp the network with but it might just be enough for wcf has a peer to peer it might be interesting for is an article about

on the requirements you you seem to be needing to do much manipulation of the data in the particularly it looks like some of these can be treated as lists of data associated with the user lists of addresses and the data access code you posted already seems to be structured this i think in your scenario you have a need to make the logic side of your application more names are being treated like a list of data related to the i think you want to make the first insert of it the piece that creates the you have other information you can add to the main like interfaces consider if you are getting any out of it is a nice way to break direct dependencies between the but it look you have that scenario in the also note that declaring interfaces force you to use as you can require a property with a get to be implemented by the a type property to each of the classes used in the you can use this to reduce the code in both the interface and the data access in the you can now just loop through the list and insert all of those in the same to use something that helps you with the data like linq2sql or this will simplify the data access code and make it less error there is not a single solution for all and even in specific scenarios personal experiences will affect the way each person tackles the there are practices and principles meant to reduce but even then differences do that i suggest you read some info on ddd and they are not a recipe for these but learning about those definitely helps software about questions in the linq2sql supports stored check scott series on you loose part of the flexibility of linq2sql by using but it will help you the there are different the main issue is regarding concurrent updates to the same if concurrent updates is not an then you can just leave the latest so you just save the in that case the only original data you need is the id of the and you let the data be if you need to detect concurrent you have to either keep a copy of all the original values or use a the sp code needs to check original values match when updating the can configure linq2sql in the designer to control what type of concurrency update strategy you are using and what original values you are there are probably some in so related to how you specifically hook it will depend on the use you are giving it its generated entities or rolling your attaching sp to the entities or and even the controls you as some of them can hold original values for you

probably need to be more specific about what you the key thing to know is that when bouncing the the angle of incidence equals the angle of in pong like they usually alter the angle based on the part of the paddle that it hit if the paddle were an using a it has a start point and a if the start point is the left side of the screen then you are in because the normal slope intercept formula works mx m is slope and b is the where it crosses the value of y when x is then increment x some amount and calculate on the return you can do this m is 0 when the vector is perfectly when it hits the to preserve angle of incidence angle of reflection you just need to use for the position on the if you have any comment on this answer or update your question and i will try to provide more

question is what is a deadlock or a wrong finanical deadlocks are far worse than wrong i know that sounds but hear me the traditional example of db transactions is you update two subtracting from one and adding to that is a financial database you use business that means adding one row to each it is of upmost importance that these transactions complete and the rows are successfully the account balance temporarily wrong a big that is what the end of day reconciliation is and an overdraft from an account is far more likely to occur because two atms are being used at once than because of a uncommitted read from a sql server 2005 fixed most of the bugs that made nolock so unless you are using sql server 2000 or you need info on row level	
question leads on to some fun diversions concerning the nature of python objects and garbage probably helpful to understand that all variables in python are really that is they are names in a namespace as a whch point to an address in memory where the object actually for the value of an uninitialized variable is the same as asking for the value of the thing a pointer points to when the pointer has not yet been created obviously nonsense which is why the most sensible thing python can do is throw a meaningful oddity of the python language is that possible that an object exists long before you execute an assignment you magically create an object nope it already since is an immutable singleton there are already a few hundred pointers to commment by jfs here to show the a 1 integers less than 256 are b 1000

real value in hungarian notation dates back to c programming and the weakly typed nature of back in the day the easiest way to keep track of the type was to use languages like the type system tells you all you need to and the ide presents this to you in a very user friendly way so there is simply no need to use for good reason to not use well there are quite a in and for that matter and many other langause you often create your own so what would be the hungarian for a even if you can decide on sensible hungarian notations it still makes the actual variable name slightly harder to read because you have to skip past the at the more important is the maintainance cost what if you start of with a list and change to another type of collection i seem to do a lot at the you then need to rename all your variables that use that all for no real if you had just used a decent name to begin with you have to worry about your what if you created or used some more meaningful type for holding a path you then need to change your to which is a pain and in this case not actually very

reason not a compilation is because perfectly valid to send a message not known at compile time to any object any object can be configured to handle messages dynamically as all method calls are really messages being sent to if you see any warnings you should address as in most cases they can lead to problems you the misleading aspect is here is that if you compile a file once and it has only if you compile other classes without making changes to the class that has the warning will not show in the compiler so every now and then you may want to all and build again to make sure you miss any helmstetter

short answer is that including the qt testlib causes the console to removing it makes it go explain if your file adds testlib to sql webkit network the final link step is carried out with a line like wound up using the console i presume using testlib forces this to happen so that the test output has somewhere to we now edit the file and remove the reference to testlib and we get a link step like subsystem is no more console

small caveat up i have no idea about using or i think your milestones be set by the version control bug tracking milestones are just significant events in your they should be significant to all stake the completion of a major deliverable is a the completion of a few features sign off on all plans and contracts is a significant but the completion of 10 mockups tend to use the schedule and tasks for working with the tick tasks off as they are to everyone else i just report on are we going to make uat by may yes we milestones are tools for reporting to sponsors and other stakeholders you should set them to be what they think is my sponsors will want to know when a certain core set of features is so that is a want to know when uat is signed off so that is a too few milestones and no one will know how you are progressing until the set too many and the value will be is no magic but projects with hundreds of tasks and thousands of man hours may only have 4 a rough diagram of a schedule and this relate to trac and svn but hopefully this gives you a rough idea on how milestones are generally oh and apologies in advance for the overuse of comic

tests localize failures more tests more closely correspond to user requirements and so are better predictor of delivery neither of them is much good unless built and but both of them are very valuable if properly thing with units tests is that no integration level test can exercise all the code as much as a good set of unit tests that can mean that you have to refactor the tests but in general your tests depend on the internals so lets say for example that you have a single function to get a power of you describe it a formal methods claim you specify returns for 0 p test and your spec look essentially the same is sort of for your implementation can be a for loop with a and you can come along later and change that to a you change the implementation so returning 16 bits that is only guaranteed to be no less than then this tests will fail an test should probably but not and just as likely as not to fail somewhere far downstream of the computation of point is that they really test for diferent if you could build sufficiently details and extensive integration you might be able to get the same level of coverage and degree of but probably hard to do at and the exponential explosion will defeat by partitioning the state space using unit the number of tests you need grows much less than

that we have lambdas and type inference and some other an idiom that is common in other languages which now makes a lot of sense in your example was about opening a doing something to and then closing you can make a helper method which opens a and also takes care of making sure to close dispose clean but calls out to a lambda you provide for the this will help you get the complicated stuff right in one and then use it over and an static void file openfile openfile making this up point is you are acquiring a resource that needs to be cleaned up or or callers of this method have to worry about how to open the file or close dispose of they can do something like f text

the answer is thinking about the singleton pattern in php right now and have decided that although the singleton pattern can be coded in it is not really implemented since the instance is not shared across requests stored in the process memory which is the case for web server environments like java and ruby on you can serialize the singleton instance and store it in but not shared across i speculate that it would have to be stored in cache in order to fully implement the singleton pattern in but i done that so not

there a reason that you want to avoid using the data binding it handles keeping parity between the value and the property value and provides rich can interface with the data binding engine in two either programatically or through the to do basic data binding programatically is say i have a class named with a string property named i have a textbox named mytxtbox on a form with an instance of fooclass called foo and i want to bind it to the mystring this will cause updates to the textbox to get assigned to the and changes to the property from elsewhere will be reflected in the more complex data binding probably want to create an object data source in your project and put a bindingsource on your if you need help with specific steps in creating the data source i can but in general create the source in your project and select the class to which you want to you can then place a bindingsource on your point it at your object project data then use the visual studio designer to bind properties for your controls to properties on your you then set the datasource property in your code to an instance of the class or collection to which you want to a side as far as i am aware there is no as properties are actually function pairs and a i read your like to point out that data even at the control does not automatically use data binding is built around type descriptors and property both for the bound control and the data true that if one or both of these sides does not implement specific property and type description then reflection will be but either side is more than free to provide its own description profile which would not use

thing to keep in mind is that on the you can compile for multiple and produce a known as a it may be better to simply compile with both i386 which will allow the user to choose at runtime which one to run can also include ppc if you want to support older ppc that if the user ends up moving their filesystem from one machine to they will still have appropriate binaries for the given see the transition for more

think already seen the about tools for migrating vb6 to have published special offer prices for the uk market on their products on this microsoft uk of course you need to know the limitations of the basic products and the prices for your market to make a realistic so you probably do need to contact them upgrade companion developer edition for up to lines of now offering a that can do up to lines of visual basic migration partner professional edition they told me this was also for up to lines of microsoft upgrade wizard is pathetic to the guy who wrote of course he is from artinsoft so he wants to sell you something microsoft uk also the artinsoft and code architects tools are better than the upgrade i contacted code architects for a they responded very unlike this stack overflow by who had a worse but then francesco balena popped up on stack overflow to answer his question within 12 which is more

think i know why this fails to work as because the initial user list is a linq it is each time it is iterated when used in and again when doing the and new user objects are this would lead to different references and so no using fixes this because it iterates the linq query once only and so the references are been able to reproduce the problem you have and having investigated the this seems like a very plausible i proved it just ran the test but outputting the collection before the call to in that and after each time the hash code for the object was output and they do indeed have different values each time indicating new as i is the output for each of the here is the modified code to show the int string user iuser public int public string public override string return id public static locallist new new new var matches from u in join lu in on equals select return public static void foreach user in static void xdocument doc new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new new users new id name a objects have not been var matches var excludes excludes should contain 6 users but here it contains 8

think it would have helped you to get answers if abstracted the problem so that it rely on the neodatis db interface that threw me for a as never used what written below about it is based on a very cursory that never used groovy though i like what seen of but seeing as no one else has answered stuck with me think the problem at least part of may be that expecting too much of the simplenativequery class from it look like it even tries to filter the objects before it adds them to the returned i think instead you want to use the in the package this has me a bit as i know for sure if this class is meant to be used by but i see any other classes in neodatis that allow for query criteria to be instead of using criteriaquery i think rather wrap it inside of a groovy class so that you can use it with i think a groovy version of your code with closures might look something like create a class that wraps criteriaquery and allows you to pass this is wordy but at least groovycriteriaquery extends criteriaquery private final i prefer to check for null instead of in if throw new be c public boolean assuming here that can be used as the object instance at least as proxy for may have to extract the actual object from aoi before calling return now use the query class in some random src new hope this

think something like the following is going maven forks jvm processes for separate steps in its build typically runs its compile in the background so that step will be added to the compile if there are substantial this is where losing addition upon mvn each test method gets its own since test passage is a to the package possible that losing time to your junit test executions if slow running this is only a likely culprit if you have a lot of test code in your source likely of your class does substantial amounts of file so an area of it looks like your loop is executing 1000 times per file discovery event meaning printstream creations in the body of the	
think that html and css are showing their i think that browsers are showing their i like being able to describe what i want but not how to do guess what i want is browser vendors to use one rendering or if nothing a of certification for kind of a global impartial body measures browsers on a quality like with ssl done by a third not sure what the pricing structure would be but i think you should have to pay for i think that it would make a great in this logo like the spam free and free logos seen popping up on sites over the or perhaps an acid3 passed logos for would argue that libraries like jquery and prototype exist because browsers all have their we just got tired of writing all that handling so some very smart people did this for

think the check makes sense when you want to be sure the file was there in the first as you said settings there is a file i will try and merge the existing settings instead of blowing them cases would be when a user tells me to do something with a yes i know the openfiledialog will check if a file exists this is i vaguely remeber back in vb6 this was not the so verifying the file existed that they just told me to use was rather not program by miss the you might try and access the an exception is thrown and then when you go to create the the file was already placed which now causes your exception handling code to go on the so i guess we could then have an exception handler in our exception handler to catch that the file changed yet rather try and prevent not use them to control another time to check for attributes such as size is when your waiting for a file operation to yes you never know for sure but with a good algorithim and depending on the system writting the file you might be able to handle a good deal of cases a system running for five years which watched for small files coming over and it uses a the same api as the file system and then starts polling waiting for the file to stop before raising an event that the file is ready to be	
think the database design should come first and it should be a simple and as efficient as then you build your good form building app should be able to look at a database or a group of and figure out what belongs what type of content is being stored primary and function with as little configuration from the end user as otherwise not going to be able to normalize your and going to have all kinds of data all over the easy enough to get the info on a particular the best route i	
think the most important practice in ensuring that your scripts are is them against a test database multiple times after any changes to the the errors you encounter should shape your response to your edit on in general i think it is best to avoid the system tables in favor of the system views 1 from where drop 1 from where drop	
think the most important principle is yagni gonna need in other write extra code until actually because if you write it in advance the requirements and constraints may well have changed you finally do need dependency all this stuff adds complexity to your making it harder to understand and my rule of thumb is to keep things as simple as possible no and to not add complexity unless it gains me more than enough to offset the burden it if you are actually testing and having a mock object would be very useful then by all means define an interface that both your mock and real classes but create a bunch of interfaces on the purely hypothetical grounds that it might be useful at some or that it is oo

tried to research this on google but there appear to me to be any coherent simple is this because not or because not using the correct this is the progress made so 8 vertices to form 2 a texture with a 200 bit alpha value about the same texture to each which shows that when i use a texture with 255 it appears init is something like the i for j pixel is somewhat similar to the code snippet from page 417 in the programming and creates a check the display function use model view so that rotation value is not etc top bottom bottom top not neccecary to just good top bottom bottom top this renders a 2nd square in the i can see this but it looks like being blended with the background assume this because they are darker with 200 bit alpha than 255 instead of the texture textures not you can no how can i fix do i make textures transparent in

try not to comment the obvious however the modern techniques of documenting the code often force to break this consider the following returns the user string the function return end we need this longer that the function itself to know what it is supposed to no the code itself is clear enough and but unless we add the there will be problems with the documentation generators and i think that the answer to the question do we depend on the code we are going to when making a website i unsually put any for the standard parts of the because almost all of them follow the same check the parse the optionally get the do the something with the redirect the user such code is easily readable even after two or more the other we have a specialized code that solves a particular technical for example a kind of the complexity is we use some data the algorithm may move the data between them to perform a certain task if i see that the algorithm does not follow any popular i describe the used data its purpose and what operations are performed on them in order to complete the i also try to why the specified solution was i find the comment syntax useful internal and system functions that are not exposed but also should be briefly especially in complex code just to what they are actually why and what their arguments the alternative is to find all the occurences of them and i must also point that sometimes it is very hard to what is worth a couple of months ago i returned to a piece of code in one of my projects to add some extra suddenly i noticed a quite important condition and had no why i used i think it must have been something obvious while writing this but even the investigation help last comment practice i use is marking the end of the class and interface with its end helps me

type inference used by thus i presume other is very precise the compiler will only allow the statement if the type is clear and the outcome is not really a loss in precision it is merely that saving the developer from stating the type more than reducing duplication in the it is important to realize that the result is strongly the compiler at exactly what type the variable there is like a variant if you type x it simply figures out that x is an int because you put an int on the thus saving you some typing and only reason future maintenance programmers might not understand it is if they simply understand the language feature of type inference in the first but i think it is more sound to expect and require that maintenance programmers know the language than it is to avoid good language features out of fear that future programmers know guess if in a situation where you that future programmers are junior and not very knowledgeable about the then maybe you would avoid some but that makes me wonder if you should consider some other or even a like access which is a hybrid of and something that a can do some things	
type of is unsigned in your if i read the standard the rule is that the operands are converted to the larger type its or unsigned type corresponding to the signed type is in your even if it prevent the wraparound to memory before because it might be the case i386 it that is the same as in your both and unsigned would be undefined so the question is not that that matters in other contexts gives different results depending on the types of and even in the absence of undefined would solve your problem by checking for overflow on line since 4096 is a pretty small constant and overflow on most architectures need to return leaves out the case when or are you might want to check for it if you could check for overflow like 4096

understand your question that you want to combine a vector of real parts with a vector of imaginary parts into a vector of complex has one template parameter which lets you chose the numerical represenation of the parts of the complex if you want complex values based on or or even some custom number the complex type then defines basic complex algebra in terms of the underlying your code you are trying to construct a complex type based on a vector of floats a complex value having a real and imaginary part being a which is obviously instead you want a of complex numbers of type have to do something no need to ita itb ita itb most cases it necessary to create containers such as vectors on the heap using try to avoid the standard library doesnt contain a combining iterator one that combines two which would allow a more elegant solution zip for a general

unit expectation is it the code it should not scan the buffer for data the code should create a byte buffer explicitly on stack or on heap and fill it with the extracts from each the extracts can be obtained in way by using the right shift operation against the integer values and casting the result by the byte type such as your snippet writes past you could fix that by changing the result is technically because the alignment of members in the structures is

use a different set of symbols to represent the machine but nobody because you gain has an instruction called in arm represents the of machine code which constitute an instruction to increment register you call that you change the set of instructions available and still call it arm still fundamentally the same programming language whether you call the add operation or or or since easier to use existing references if everyone uses the same names for what useful change might be to represent the instruction as since arm have an inc and a common this leads to macros in assembler these genuinely do change the but once you have macros which emit multiple arm you start to lose the wysiwyg nature of eventually you start to think that maybe you might as well just write i speak from experience but it was a macroised common difference is case if you felt like being you could argue that there are two different versions of arm assembler one in uppercase and one in lowercase argue that one with multiple symbols for the same different disassemblers of the same machine code sometimes output different sometimes these are different enough that a particular assembler cope with all of or assemblers will offer their own conveniences which are incompatible with another assembler on the same but all the same and if bothering to draw the generally because been bitten in the ass rather than because anything good is

use mysql in my app the mysql is there anyway to programmatically check whether the db server is i came across but unfortunately that work the way it should connection has to be opened first using also it keeps on returning false even if the db server becomes available the only solution i came up with is to use the if that throws an exception then the db server is not is there a more reliable way to do i read somewhere that using might not work as expected if connection pooling is this could result an exception being thrown even if the db server is you want the details please read my i log all exceptions i try to log them to the db server could be the same db server down but could be depending on the configuration if that fails the exceptions are logged to a text now i want to handle the case if the db server is normally what will happen is that exceptions will keep on being thrown with almost every request to my this means the log will be full with those the other problem is that keep on serving error pages to users in other words the users will keep on seeing error pages with every request they make to the what i want to do is that if a db exception is thrown of type to check whether the db server is if not then change some flag in my app and serve a page that contains something like the application is temporarily unavailable flag is checked in an httpmodule and redirects or transfers to that also planning to make it send me an sms using an sms proxy so that i could take an but this another story and is not related to this there a simple way in my app to programmatically find out whether the mysql db server is

very convenient to have r scripts for doing simple plots from the command running r from bash scripts is not convenient at the ideal might be something i been able to make either of those option is keeping the scripts purely in and invoking it with or occasionally a script will rely on obscure command line switches at which point part of the code exists outside the sneaking things into r from bash via a local the desired switches are then everything implies except option is a bash script to store the r flags and be painlessly which then calls the r the problem is that this means a single program just got split into two files which now have to be keep in transferred to new machines option i currently despise least is embedding the r in a bash usage message to catch bad input without invoking any bash of r code goes in a single executable and easily handles the problem is that combining bash and r like this pretty much eliminates the possibility of any ide not failing on one or the and makes my heart hurt real there some better way the best way to use r scripts on the command

w has already suggested the structure which can represent a pointer or whilst this structure is part and parcel of the really have pointers and certainly not like c is primarily because the framework is a platform and memory is allocated and deallocated by the clr without the having to worry about it no malloc mostly because of this memory management that you really have access to direct memory closest thing within the framework that can be thought of as a really is the you can think of a as a not really a pointer in the strictest add to calling allowing code that a delegate instance to ensure that it is calling the correct method with the correct this is unlike pointers as they are not and merely reference a memory are everywhere in the and whenever you use an or respond to an using you want to use rather than you can write code that is marked as this allows code within the unsafe block to run outside of the protection of the in allows usage of just like they still do have some limitations as what can be at the memory address that is pointed

willing to consider a different approach altogether to detecting illegal copies of your you could consider copyright information into the digital object without the loss of whenever the copyright of a digital object is in this information is extracted to identify the rightful it is also possible to encode the identity of the original buyer along with the identity of the copyright which allows tracing of any unauthorized also a complex there are techniques that allow the watermark information to persist through gross image any signal transform of reasonable strength cannot remove the hence a pirate willing to remove the watermark will not succeed unless they debase the document too much to be of commercial the faq calls implementing this but if you succeed with you get a high confidence of whether the image is a copy or rather than a percentage

with a linked list it should be feasible search for the first entry and keep it as the there are no entries then done anyway then just iterate through the whole list if before the insertion location and find a entry or if after the insertion location and find a entry then move it to directly before the so so you can convert an array into a linked list in and you can copy the data into the array in so i think it would work in terms of but not think about whether it can be done

working with http has anyone noticed that the final two events in the pipeline presendrequestheaders and presendrequestcontent always verified that code bound to endrequest will but will not when bound to either presendrequestheaders or there a reason i thought perhaps it was a caching issue a 304 not you actually send but cleared caches and determined that the server is returning 200 which would indicate that it sent is a problem because the statuscode of the response defaults to 200 and my understanding is that it get updated to something like a 404 or 206 until those two final if i check the statuscode during it will always read presendrequestheaders and presendrequestcontent run

would a new object know which network to join or depending on what exactly you there are number of can use less precise timer than every for example something like time channel time the objects rezzed at nearly the same time are likely to have same channel according to the above although probably want to make sure that time 1000 is not near 0 or 1000 and perhaps use time 10000 in that than you can create some sort of discovery for rezzed object says hello on control server for each network in area responds with channel number of its chooses network he wants to nobody object becomes server for its own by incrementing control channel by some number example object wants to create its own network it increments highest channel in use by and creates its own you can combine both methods use to derive say and if server responds become otherwise become you can check appropriate higher and lower channel to avoid having two networks because of time rollover differences in rezzing of	
would add that it is unlikely for you to find lower level functions like these in the if you were confused as to why the suggestions both pointed to then you probably could use some details on there are ways to define functions that them to windows api functions that do not exist within assemblies they are typically implemented in and available as a standard this process is considered to be platform can be a bit wobbly at first to match up all the data types between and style but there are others out there that have paved the suggested has a over at this wrapper when available in your will allow you to call sendinput as if it were a is basically a pinvoke wiki for well known api calls in and typically has a wrapper of api	
would advocate the refactoring approach did we get here in the first why the individual methods can throw the exception after doing with myobject and that exception can then be safely since the exception escapes the myobject must be in an unknown safe to ignore the surely it must be the wrong way to communicate that something went wrong in each maybe each method that needs to do some logging on if you use static you can pass a logger to each

would consider migrating the ms access portion to ms sql is possible but not sure of the issues related to that would handle a lot of the multi user issues that ms access had few issues converting other ms access applications to ms sql end stays in ms and the tables are linked to the ms sql db through so low and you get there is something technological that forces you to use ms the easiest thing to do would be to just create an odbc link to the oracle table through ms that way you are only updating it one i also question the decision to move the table from oracle to ms more trusting of oracle dbs right off the start and ms is not known to be highly performing over add more memory to the oracle give it a faster tightest bottle neck is not going to be the database going to be your so you are moving the problem from one server to another and you are adding to the network congestion by having to synchronise the ms access table with the oracle

you are just processing rows as you it be better to just select the top n primary key values into a temp table table tempid int not null primary key int not int not into top n from keys should not change very often but other columns can with no harm to doing it this the of the insert and you can do a easy loop on tempid where it will be from 1 to join to your mykeys table and be on your with no need to duplicate all the runs fine on my sql server where is an identity create empty temp from mytable left outer join mytable m2 on where into top 1 from from with no create empty temp from mytable left outer join mytable m2 on where insert into select top from what is your real why do you need to loop while inserting into this temp you may be able to shift strategy and come up with a much better algorithm

you can not have constructors on interfaces for the reasons that have been however you can on abstract lets say for example you have this base abstract class protected int protected string public string there is no constructors that takes no argument which means any class that inherits from classone must call the constructor that has 2 this is not valid and will not class classtwo public this is valid and will class classtwo public string would like to point out here that in you can only inherit from one base meaning that this may not be the correct solution for particular situation but is something to think

you consider the notifier object not to be part of the model object which owns so that modifying the notifier as modifying the then make getnotifier a const method returning a const const but returns a to allow observers to return will then have to either mark as or else own it by pointer smart or reference rather than by either you avoid a it is usually preferable to embed objects rather than to but if this is a case where a notifier considered part of the model which uses then embedding is not owning it by reference forces you to initialize the reference when model is which leads to dependency which is no bad owning by smart pointer means as with you have to do anything about may be other ways to design things as addition of another but your comment because it needs to return a suggests to me that you can do exactly what you originally you just realise you

you do not provide a namespace then your type has no remember that namespaces have any meaning they simply get appended to the beginning of you name to create a longer name that has a greater probability of being i think that you may have two separate assemblies and one ought to be referencing the other but it is if two projects are in a single solution then the class viewer will show all types from all projects but that does not necessarily mean that references in order to use the types from in you need to ensure that a project reference

you have classes representing tables in a simplified would have a class and a class instances are representing rows of the respective and company would inherit from some base abstract say that will have some common methods like etc you want to store data about the validation and the table the best place would be in a static variable in each derived class since the validation and table definition is the same for each instance of lsb the mentioned method in baseobject would have no reference to the static variables defined in user and even though you are calling it through an instance of it will look for the same static variable in the baseobject and it will raise an is my experience with php lsb is going to be introduced in

you need to do is nullify all the pointers to the object you just the idea of pointers is that there will be more than one pointer storing the address of the same if there is little reason to use a bare and so the pattern trying to capture is not very useful but you are far from the first person to try as other answers have the only way to deal with pointers is to carefully control access to title of your question is absolutely a good reason for a pointer identifies a location that stores an object of a specific a pointer to a pointer gives you the ability to change what object a pointer points new class derives from and so does my suppose the compiler allowed you to do expected that to but if it then we would now have a pointer that in fact pointers to an instance of who says those two types are this is a very frequent misunderstanding it crops up repeatedly here for other especially with regard to and in

you ultimately i is to have the user type depending on the user will get slight different the first will not fulfill but the second on the price of code you can do is to invert the struct vectorbase struct struct struct vector implement the few functions that depend only on n being some specific value in the appropriate you may add a protected destructor into to prevent users deleting instances of through pointers to they should not even be able to name put those bases in some implementation like idea is to combine this solution with the one mentioned in another inherit privately of publicly as and add wrapper functions into the derived class that call the implementations of the another idea is to use just one class and then to enable or disable them for particular values of or use a transformer like this which is much anyi struct i2t anyi struct forward to the void case for n void case for n void general void it is completely transparent to the user of it also add any space overhead for compilers doing the empty base class optimization
