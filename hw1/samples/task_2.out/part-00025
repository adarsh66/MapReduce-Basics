a behavior seen before with the development web server and something similar with iis in that case you usually get a the default configuration for many other web servers the for iis is in iis you can configure the default page click on your virtual directory select then on the tab you have the option to default content pages for your i know if a way of doing it for the visual studio development web your scenario if you take your files and rename them to you do not need to change their you should see your page instead of the directory	
a char is really just a and all that that evalutates whether the bit the in the intx member of whatever pointer points to is not the inverts the so all the 0s become 1s and vice then the 1 i puts a single 1 in the desired combines the two values so that only the desired bit is and the whole thing evalutes to true if that bit was 0 to begin is bitwise it takes each bit in both operands and performs a logical producing a result where each bit is set if either operand had that bit 0b11000000 0b00000011 is an assignment in the same way that means means using bitwise operators can make things easier to read in some but it will usually also make your code significantly slower without strong compiler

a form is just a place to display data and allow for user input and the state information is held not in the form but in the underlying then probably no compelling reason not to just create a new form when you need think the form is the place to be holding any state info about your program and thus you ought to be able to close the form and make a new one without any i always follow my own advice and state often creeps into my form probably because it is so convenient to do guess a consideration would be if there was significant construction necessary to bring a form and its various controls into populate it with data and display it to the

a the defaults are essentially reference and that is usually if writing a it is more common to override equality least to avoid but it is very rare you write a struct overriding you should always have a matching and for two if returns true they return the same but the converse is and it is common to also provide and often to implement generating the hash it is common to use a factored as this avoids collisions on paired values for for a basic 2 field disable for the unlikely possibility that are compiling with int hash hash hash return has the advantage hash of is not the same as the hash of hash of is not the same as the hash of which can be common if just using an unweighted or xor	
a think you need to consider the relative costs of both functions the absolute cost of for control essentially compares the current threadid with the expected if you look in reflector the code is slightly more complex but in effect what this is fairly cheap as just a few function calls and a involves taking several adding delegates to an invoke queue and potentially a marshal between this code is much more expensive relative to the actual invokerequired call an order of magnitude or you would need a great deal more calls where invokerequired returns true before you would see any gain by just going straight to	
a to an is something known in the c standard as a arithmetic so not an reason compilers often issue a warning on this by default is because so commonly done in code there would be far too many warnings issued in there is an awful lot of code out there that works with values to deal with things that are inherently unsigned buffer sizes for also very common to mix signed and unsigned values in not to say that these silent conversions responsible for it might not be a bad idea to enable the warning for new code so from the i think probably find it rather overwhelming to deal with the warnings issued by existing

afraid the short answer is that you do this using the filefield or imagefield they just store a file path and have no real concept of the actual the long is that anything is possible if you leverage the django api for writing your own model a want to implement the method to convert the data for serialization an example in the django docs at the link note that the examples at the url link above also include mention of subclassing filefield and which is helpful for your also have to decide if the data should therefore be stored in the or on the file if the you will have to implement your custom class as a blob including customization for every db you wish to also have to provide some support for how the data should be returned to the user out of the database when the html requests a if the which is the smarter way to go have to implement methods for binary data to the either if you implement these as subclasses of filefield and you should still be able to use the admin tools and other modules that expect such django and only if you elect to use the more involved blob a snippet of code from an old project of mind when i was learning that handles blob for mysql and probably be able to find a number of improvements as i touched it since it does not handle so have to add that using the method import import the blob value so that we can override the unicode after the query django attempts to record the last and at that point it attempts to force the query to this does not work for binary data and generates uncaught def def return def return field for persisting binary data in databases that we def if return elif return raise def if if value is return return return def if value is return if return return

am currently reading in depth by jon skeet and have been reading about value and reference got me thinking about the cost of using value types as method parameters due to that value being copied when while this cost is not much when considering what if those value parameters were strings which got passed around numerous there be a benefit to using say a stringbuilder class and passing it instead of a string you considered that the string was say 1024 and was passed around even just a few times between contrast that with a stringbuilder with the same value which would end up passing the value of the reference being 4 or 8 bytes each you could have a considerable performance question may also highlight a vital piece of understanding i may be missing regarding the string feel free to point this out where what what impact would this have on garbage collection regarding the strings in each apparently i did forget one vital piece of information about strings which renders the question null and thanks of passing lots of value types in

am trying to place an action to happen after an entire page the is a function that uses the response object to send a file to the detailed am trying to replicate the behavior of a link on the from a i have a link on the main page for the export and it works fine since the page is already displayed before the user clicks but when the user is on a clicks the it should take them back to this main page and then send the file after it did some research and thought that using the pagecomplete event would be for so i created my event handler and put the call to the export code keys off of a query string when loaded from the inside my pagecomplete event but it behaves just the same way the browser download box pops up and the page is never loaded before or it helps to understand what doing here is a snippet of the code used to send the list to the would prefer a way to use a page event to load the rather than tinkering with this if there is a clean and easier way to get the file and it allows for loading the page then sending the that would be fine there another page event i can use besides or is it possible i am missing sorry about the i realize that i change the way http requests work only looking for an acceptable solution that achieves more or less the same it seems like the way to go is to force a refresh of the page after a couple of seconds ensuring that it loads before the file download code is so i am looking for a way to do this as the first answer suggests refresh to a have to be delayed if a way to refresh with no this code private void if if if supposed to after page loading is do a reloading itself with a different query when it reaches the page loadcomplete event the second time it will trigger the function which writes out the it actually apparently repeats the same problem it goes back to the same how do you execute an action after the page or wait until the page completely finishes then trigger a refresh which will execute the is there no way for to do something by itself without the user clicking on the then an after 2 seconds would also be but not sure how to do pagecomplete event troubles and file

am writing a linq provider to a hierarchal data i find it easiest to design my api by writing examples showing how i want to use and then coding to support those use thing i am having trouble with is an way to express or recursion in a linq in other what is the best way to distinguish item in where select item in where select please note neither of those examples above necessarily reflect the structure of the query i i am interested in good way to express i am not asking how to implement such a or how to write my iqueryable or ienumerable in such a way that allows i am asking from the standpoint of a person writing the linq query and utilizing my provider what is an intuitive way for them to express whether they want to recurse or data structure resembles a typical file a folder can contain a collection of and a folder can also contain a collection of so represents all the folders who are immediate children of and contains all the items immediately within a basic example of a site much like a filesystem with folders and i item in where select is the most intuitive way to express an intent that the query get all items underneath light or only the immediate the way to distinguish between the two goal is to be able to turn this linq provider over to other developers who have an average understanding of linq and allow them to write both recursive and list queries without giving them a tutorial on writing recursive given a usage that looks i can code the provider against am really sucking at communicating this linq provider is to an external it is not simply walking an object nor in this specific case does a recursive actually translate into any kind of true recursive activity under the just need a way to distinguish between a query and a what do you think is the best way to express or is there a standard way of expressing it that missed out recursion in

answerers here seem a bit not everyone can afford to go to a and not doing something really put you in good stead with your especially if they think it is so just refusing to do it could result in you begin i think a good first step is to talk to the people requesting the explain that it may not be legal and ask them to check i would imagine that companies have easier access to lawyers than most if your company is not willing to take legal advice then you may have to go it but this could still make life difficult for you at should imagine some shady would object to you asking or even raising the issue as that makes their own deniability more

are many forms of leaks that allocates unmanaged leaks that allocates and uses unmanaged like lifetime of understanding of how gc and memory management in the first two is usually handled by two different pieces of idisposable on the object and disposing of the unmanaged in the dispose a to make sure unmanaged resources are deallocated when gc has found the object to be eligible for is you are using a big list holding thousands of totalling a significant size of if you keep around a reference to this list for longer than you need you will have what looks like a memory in if you keep adding to this so that it grows with more data and old data is never you definitely have a memory source of this seen frequently is to attach methods to event handlers but forget to unregister them when slowly bloating the event handler both in size and code to an incorrect understanding of how memory management works can mean that you look at the memory usage in a process viewer and notice that your app keeps growing in memory if you have lots and lots of memory gc might not run that giving you an incorrect picture of the current of as opposed to mapped only seen one resource management bug in so far and afaik it has been slated for fix in it was with copying the desktop screen into a in response to the question in the how to avoid keeping references longer than then the only way to do that is to to just me if you have a method it might be processing files on or downloading or and you used a reference to a big early in the before the and then you use that data structure for the rest of the then in not running under a is smart enough to know that this though it is held in a variable that is technically in is eligible for garbage the garbage collector is really aggressive in this in and running under a it will keep the reference for the life of the in case you want to inspect it when stopped at a if the reference is stored in a field reference in the class where the method is not so since impossible to determine whether it will be reused later or at least very very if this data structure becomes you should clear the reference holding to so that gc will pick it up

are returning a pointer to a local variable this is invalid and surprised you receive a warning about a function exits all local variables cease to exist as going out of and their memory will be used for other you are returning a pointer to this but no guarantee what will now be this case it seems that at the time of the printf call the memory contains a 0 which is treated as an empty this is actually quite you could easily end up with either garbage being printed or the program resolve this you can either pass a buffer into or have czas allocate a buffer on the heap which you later i would recommend the former because it is inline with how virtually all library functions it also avoids memory allocations where the caller must later free the struct tm time timeinfo localtime return strftime char buffer if to czas i notice that strftime took a size updated the code to use this and correctly pass back the result from as a result this is far more robust and you cannot accidentally overflow the

been working on an app that handles this exact behavior for the last 2 months or it has a small subset of functions which are online only and a large set of functionality that is using sqlite for local storage as suggested here with a modified version of the sqlitepersistentobjects the base version of sqlitepersistentobjects is not thread safe so watch out if you are using out objectiverecord for a thread safe alternative but be prepared to dig into the if you are willing to develop for the sdk then core data is another possibility for a sqlite overall architecture is simple enough i have modeled local storage using sqlite and remote interaction using against a rails app and rest it can use either xml or json for data an object is modified locally the change is first saved to the sqlite database record for that object and then added to a queue which is serialized and stored in the local sqlite db as queue can then be processed at any there is a connection available any queued local changes are deserialized and added to an nsoperationqueue which then processes them in the order to make this all work subclassed nsoperation so that it can support several types of remote queue operations delete essentially using objective resource to make the remote nice thing about using nsoperationqueue and nsoperation is that they handle the background threading for you so highly recommend having a look at the apple docs for those classes and also at the apple the application loads there is a bit of remote checking done and processed in the background to pull down the latest data although to be honest i am still changing the way this behaves a a quick overview of what had to deal with so it helps a

believe that the following piece of code is generating memory external function to dynamically allocate a vector template t t v return function that calls dvector after frees it void int double stuff with thought by passing the pointer to it would allocate it and return the correct so that would successfully it does not seem to be the i have also tested with replacing without success have a similar piece of code for allocating a i decided to manage like that because i am using them a and i also would like to understand a bit deeper memory management with i would pretty much like to keep an external function to allocate vectors and arrays for the catch here to avoid the memory have been using the dvector function to allocate types as so that is potentially a i since i have constructors being though in the piece of code before i free the i also would like to otherwise allocate a vector and left it to be assessed through its pointer by other if using it will automatically clean the allocation upon the end of the i get a array with i suppose easily fixed with but what would be the better way for a has just occurred me that i pass the pointer as an argument to other boost seems not to be enjoying it that much and compilation exits with i stand still with the need for a pointer to a vector or a that accepts that will be passed as an argument to other the vector would most likely be allocated in an external and freed in another suitable just like to be copying the loop and new stuff for allocating the matrix everywhere in the is what like to template t int t a return void int double massmatrix function for memory allocation causes memory

best and the easiest solution is to hire a technical writer who has knowledge of software this would make the documentation process a log easier and technical writers are considered as the best option as they are far more knowledgeable when it comes to writing the development process in simple english that can be understood by between codes are often used to briefly explain what the happens next in the program and cannot fully be considered as however they will come handy when a technical writer prepares a developers	
best example i can come up with is that of a mailing list an the subscribe to a mailing list and you observe the when you are no longer interested in the you concept is the observer two or more classes are one or more subscribes to a publisher class are different and then the first class every subscribing will get notified when ever the publisher is how i explained it to my who often listens to my rantings about programming and design it made sense to i realize this might be too simple for you but is a good

best practice is to write code that others can read and update first form is questionable because it follow the forms that most php developers are used else or or short code else short code or short code short code that this is entirely about standard and necessarily make only about what other developers are used to second more so good because it makes it easy for another programmer to make this code code code c by another this the other programmer added but forgot to wrap the whole block in this will cause you can defend against this by simply wrapping your and blocks in

best way to do this will be to encrypt the sections during installation add an installer class to your project and override the install method in the in this method you should perform the you must call at the end of your overridden install in the setup project goto custom actions and locate the install custom action to be pointed with your project output or which contains the definition of your installer class this way it will encrypt your sections during an installation straight and you will not face this the application will automatically use dpapi provider to through sections or this

better to err on the side of being positive when it comes to talking about another team this is especially so if within the we all like to have our work complemented from time to let the perfect be the enemy of the programming is tough so try to ignore as much as you possibly nobody loves having their work trashed so when it comes to suggestions or pointing out mistakes less is if algorithmically sound then more often than note let almost everything else slide the goal developers that much care about improvement have something to contribute to the in mind that developers come in all some with formal training to some totally most somewhere in just because someone study cs that mean not a great feeling of working on a team and seeing its including improve over smokes this got if i manage to stick to 3 or 4 of these on any given day a good day

can see a couple of things one is that the code for the two loops looks the compiler will probably realise that the variable and the variable will always have the same value and optimise one of them you should look at the generated assembly and see what is really going theory is that the change to the inner body of the loop has affected the cachability of the code this could have moved it across cache lines or some other the code is so you may find it difficult to get an accuate timing even if you are doing 5000 you may find that the time is inside the margin for error for the timing code you are a modern computer can probably run that in far less than a millisecond perhaps you should increase the number of see the generated assembly in the compiler how can i peek at the assembly generated by how can i create a file where i see the c code and its translation use the capital to and it will emit the code to a file with a for the following leave the generated assembly on the file you want to see the c code with the assembly it was converted use a command line like will output the listing to the

certain site i know recently upgraded their bandwith from tb monthly to is they went over the limit complaining they know how to get down the bandwidth thing i seen them consider is the fact that jpeg and other images that are displayed on the it is an can contain where the picture was taken and of the matter this information is of no importance whatsoever on that not gonna be yet still adding to the since it increases the filesize of every images from a few bytes to a few a site that uses up more then tb per stripping the several thousands images of their metadata will help decrease the bandwidth usage at least by a few gigabytes per month i if not is there a way to do this in and for the allready existing does anybody know a automatic metadata i know of png but not very might be usefull for initial cleaning an image stripped of metadata upon upload in

coached a lego team for a couple of years and we used the nxt the team consisted of 7th and 8th graders and they were readily able to learn learn the graphical programming environment and to develop some pretty sophisticated programs with as coaches we guided them in good software practices testing but the kids did the work and they learned a the standard nxt software is basically a stripped down version of and reasonably easy to use but a bit that was a good feature for the kids though they learned the hard way to save their work often because the software can and does crash while you want to have a blast playing with robots and especially if you want to involve kids this is a great environment for but the standard software is a graphical programming language so wiring up and configuring function blocks not writing code and some people consider that it all depends on what you want to we only used the standard nxt software with the kids because of fll contest you prefer using procedural languages the nxt is still a great platform for learning but need to switch to an alternative development environment like one of

combine both whenever you make a tag tags should never so the presence of a tag is an indicator that you be trying to release anything else as the same when it came time to do put it onto a so the flow branch trunk to tag this new as and then bug fixes can be done on the branch avoid getting mixed up with any development that may already be on trunk and merged into each release of the fixed is tagged as from the this is basically the approach we use at work with and very similar indeed to through the i think virtually identical to far as the comment about tags being redundant because you have revision largely except that tags also specify a which files in the repository are covered by the you can reasonably ask someone to look at and they are immediately looking at a coherent if you ask them to look at revision they have to first look at revision x to see that it was changing and hence deduce that is what they should be looking what happens if revision x touched files in proj1 and which is of course but strictly speaking you should be saying and where is the list of revision numbers how do we know that is revision it should imho be possible to determine that just from the systems like tags and branches are still basically the same thing references to the object but the is that tag refs and branch refs do preferably with a specific constraint on how they perforce also has which are ways of grouping a set of file revisions together independently of a which is essentially a but more historically used changelist numbers to subversion revision qualified with the name of the branch they should be on to identify the two are almost identical any so here i guess

contemplating how to go about this and i think this is one of the key pieces of infrastructure that not having around keeps us in the dark hopefully this will be a popular question on not just that you could install a single tool to collect this because not possible but ideally you want everything from the hardware up to the applications on the network feeding into this think the only approach that makes sense is a modular the range of devices and types of information is too disparate to come under a single also the collection of data needs to be as passive and asynchronous as possible the reality of running infrastructure means that there will be interruptions and you rely on being able to get the data at all think the tools pointed out form something of an ecosystem that could work together cobbler can install from and hand over to which has support for generating nagios and storing configs in a for me only cacti is a bit opaque in terms of programmatically inserting new templates but i know this is you have to sit down and work out which pieces of information are important for the business you work and design a db schema around work out how to get the information you need into the whether from or direct snmp you asked about collection of i think if you have quite disparate kit hp then it makes sense to create a library to abstract away as much as possible the differences between so your scripts just make standard calls such as when you add new hardware you can add to the library rather than having to write a completely new

cost of memory allocation is generally much lower in a garbage collected memory then when just using new or malloc explicitly because garbage collectors generally this explicit memory models may also do this memory pools or memory making the cost of memory allocation equivalent to a pointer and pointed managed languages tend to out perform unmanaged languages in the general after pushing the unmanaged language can and will eventually beat the same thing is also evident in the language because even though tends to rank higher than java most of the often see implementations jumping trough various hoops as object to achieve optimal garbage collected tend to have easier to follow and more straight forward implementations because the gc is better at allocating chunks performance the biggest difference when it comes to gc vs arguably the deterministic finalization of reference languages that is the biggest argument for explicit memory management because this is generally used for purposes other than memory management as releasing closing file or window handles et however introduced the using idisposable construct to do exactly problem with garbage collection is that the systems they use tend to be rather complex to prevent memory this also makes it way more difficult to debug and track down once you do have a memory leak even garbage collected languages can have memory the flip the garbage collected language can do the most optimal thing at the most optimal time without having to burden the developer with that this means that developing for a gc language might be more so you can focus more on the

creating a website my pattern often is the infrastructure talk to domain services or infrastructure and domain services may talk to infrastructure services will wrap things like smtp i handle identity as an infrastructure if an infrastructure service or domain service needs to find out the invoker it will request an identity service at the identity service will have methods properties to identity the this way i have for a that determines the identity by session cookie a little stuck about how to handle results of service for i may have a service that has a method that simply takes a string comment and an identifier for the target application service calls this service perhaps like actionresult string commenttext this method may fail if the current identity or pass policy that the articleservice checks as being able to comment every 30 seconds throwing and catching exceptions from service calls like this seems very because my calling code has no way of checking if it can actually invoke this action successfully fatal app initially i started to make the services return a the result would be uniquely identifiable so the caller would know if the comment was indeed made additionally i would return the comment entity in the the results would also identify things like not post as user is not or not post as specified period has not been actually return strings but you get the reasoning behind this is that the application service be in control of if an action should imagine say i moved all of the user identity checks and everything out of the domain service and into the application have tons of replicated as well as giving the application services completely power over what can guess my question is given that infrastructure services will enforce additionally what is the best way to inform the calling code the action did or and in should secondary data as authorization be handled in an

currently working on a project that needs to time when certain processes are trying to figure out the most efficient way to scan the process then check the process list executable names against the list of supported the problem is two most efficient way to get the process executable names from the process most efficient way to compare this list to another one of the other developers was playing around with using the tasklist command and parsing out the executable i also found out that has a process list that will do this still trying to decide between java and so i probably would lean towards a language neutral but this could be a deciding factor for supported process list might be small on average process we could just run each process through the but we were thinking this might be too much for older so we were tossing around the idea of using an alphabetically balanced avl tree containing the initial process list when the application and checking everything against that and then checking against our supported process names list if its not in the suggestions are greatly apparently you can filter tasklist by process executable so we could just do that for every process on the supported process is there a tasklist equivalent that works for windows xp home efficient way to scan the windows process

database content is always a tricky clearly the content is useless unless it can be and if that has to happen without human then storing both the cyphertext and the key if that is on the same then one might wonder why you even a few reasons why you might want to do one is because to do so because of some company another is that perhaps your database is housed in a more hostile environment than that machine that accesses encrypting database content going to win you any but if you can justify then you clearly have at least some motivation to do

depend on whether using wpf or lets you databind the enabled so you can declaratively say when it should be and as long as the right events are just setting is the way to the simplest thing is to write one method called that updates on all of your controls based on your rules then btneat should be then call that method whenever the state not all state changes are in response to gui you probably want a model object that maintains state and fires an event whenever the state then whenever that event you can call your method to refresh the gui based on the new your needs are all need to if your app gets more want to look into patterns like the presenter would be the class that based on the current which actions are enabled and which are

did you come to decide on spring python as your api of spring works well on java where a tradition of declarative defining your application primarily using xml to control a core engine is a standard pattern in while the underlying patterns like inversion of control are still apposite on your use the implementation chosen by spring looks like a classic case of something produced by a java programmer who want to learn see the article is not applaud your decision to introduce order and thoughtfulness to your but you may wish to evaluate a number of options before making your in you may find that using spring python will make it difficult to hire good python many of whom will run the other way when faced with xml files describing object start by what you really want to the problem cannot simply be that need a there are lots of frameworks out and hard to evaluate if you truly need one and which one will work if you identified what underlying software problems you need to the real problem is that your code is an unmaintainable introducing a framework probably fix the instead of just messy have code that is messy in someone style perhaps rigour in the dev team is where you should recommend starting good code stringent hiring a luck with the	
difference between and module import is mainly pick the one you like best and be consistent in your use of here are some points to help you maintenance of your need to add any additional imports to start using another item from the in your code can be tedious and redundant can be minimized by using module as then typing module import typing to use control over which items of a module can be use a new item from the module you have to update your lose context about for less clear what does compared to method is but use module import any reasonable large set of if you you will likely be cementing it into the unable to be this is because it is difficult to determine what items used in the code are coming from making it easy to get to the point where you think you use the any more but extremely difficult to be

difference is that if you get that result into a reference yourself you can track the changes of the integer member variable in your own variable name without recalling the x might have probably not the best design and very dangerous to return a reference or in case a variable that gets freed from scope is so if you return a be careful to be sure it is not a variable that goes out of is a slight difference for the modifier but again probably not something that is worth doing or that was int 1 or something else another thread could have changed int x return the end result is that you obtain changes even after the parameters are

done one answer on but now like to add another from a broader sounds like the thing that make this a hard problem is that each driver is basing their actions on mental predictions of what other drivers are going to for instance when i am driving i can tell when a car is likely to pull in front of even before he based on the way he is lining himself up with the gap between me and the car in he in turn can tell that i have seen him from the fact that backing off to make room for so its ok to pull a good driver picks up lots of these subtle and its very hard to the first step is to find out what aspects of real driving are not included in the failed and work out how to put them all models are but some models are suspect that the answer is going to involve giving each simulated driver one or more mental models of what each other driver is going to this involves running the planning algorithm for driver 2 using several different assumptions that driver 1 might make about the intentions of driver meanwhile driver 2 is doing the same about driver is the kind of thing that can be very difficult to add to an existing especially if it was written in a conventional because the planning algorithm may well have side even if its only in the way it traverses a data but a functional language may well be able to do the interdependence between drivers probably means there is a fixpoint somewhere in which lazy languages tend to do better

driving ui is problematic because you often know what you want on the screen until you see it on the for that gui development tends to be massively iterative and therefore very difficult to drive with does not mean that we just abandon tdd for we push as much code as we possibly can out of the leaving behind only simple wiring that wiring allows us to make the massively iterative changes we without affecting the essence of the technique was probably best described by michael feathers some years ago in an article entitled humble dialog it is also the fundamental idea behind the pattern that caused such a stir four years and has now been split into the passive view and supervising controller the article link in this question takes advantage of these but in a rather than a idea is to test drive everything except the we even need to write the view for a good long the view is so absurdly simple that it probably need any kind of unit tests at or if it they can in fact be written test drive the supervising controller you simply make sure you understand how the data will be presented on the you need to know where the data or what the font or what color it or any of the other cosmetic issues that cause the massive iteration of you know one data item will be some kind of text another will be a still another will be a button or a check and then you make sure that the view can ask all the questions it needs to ask to get these items rendered example the text box may have a default the view should be able to ask for the menu may have some items the view should be able to ask for this the questions that the view asks are all about and are devoid of business the same the view will tell the supervising controller when anything the controller will modify the data including any kind of validation and error and then the view can ask how that data should be of this can be test driven because all decoupled from the visual all about the data is manipulated and and about what it looks so it need to be massively

ended up having to write my own assembly the basics of how it in order to help others if they need to implement their own assembly cache is a folder with a corresponding wrapper class in the method to install an assembly in the cache returns a string name under which the assembly is which the caller can save and use to retrieve the assembly method to retrieve an assembly takes the token and returns an object which encapsulates the cached installing an first compare an incoming bits to the bits of each of the already cached assemblies and determine if the assembly is already installed all the bits are the they must obviously do the same if the assembly is already then return the name of the previously cached if it is not already allow multiple versions to be installed by finding an available variant of the assembly name in the cache folder assembly assembly cache the assembly in the and return its cached name to the far a security and strong naming it does not make sense in my application to do strong name as it would be what bruce payette calls gnome security countermeasure which an attacker could merely walk if an attacker decided to poison an he would also have access to the location where the strong name would be stored and could easily change it to his strong it ends up being the responsibility to use assemblies only from sources he if the user installs a malicious it is his not to provide a little more protection for the the use of external assemblies in my application will disabled by for other it might make sense to implement strong name verification as an extra layer of

far as changing the username that can easily be accomplished by using the method and filling in the appropriate fields based on the current and then deleting the current fields are not part of the membership provider but part of the profile this is a highly debated topic and for most production the correct way to go is to a better profile provider such as this profile which stores profile fields as expect rather than as a you can easily roll your own profile check out the are certainly membership but most are buggy or have a small it really sucks to develop on top of one for two months and then realize it support all the functionality you membership is a proven solution and why it is used so

feminella got it but i think there is more to entropy is based on and probability is always in the eye of the said that 1 and 0 were equally likely if that is then the string of 100 1s followed by 100 0s has a probability of of which is 200 as you the entropy of that string shannon is its information content times its or 200 still a really small is important because if you do coding to compress the in the case of this string it will get a small but averaged over all it will not do with it will average out to about but not the other if you look at your original string and say it is so striking that whoever generated it is likely to generate more like then you are really saying its probability is larger than so you are making a different assumptions about the original probability structure of the generator of the namely that it has lower entropy than 200 i find this subject really especially when you look into kolmogorov in that you define the information content of a string as the length of the smallest program that could generate this leads to all sorts of insights into software engineering and language hope that and thanks for your

file with a other answers have the easiest method is to create a lock file in the same directory as the you want to be able to access the same file over multiple pc the best solution i can think of is to just include the identifier of the machine currently writing to the data the sequence for writing to the data file would if there is a lock file present there is a lock see if the one owning it by checking that its content has my the just write to the data file then delete the lock not the just wait a second or a small random length of time and try the whole cycle there is no lock create one with my identifier and try the whole cycle again to avoid race condition that the lock file is really with the i would record a timestamp in the lock file and check whether older than a given timeout the timestamp is too then assume that the lock file is stale and just delete it as it would mea one of the pc writing to the data file may have crashed or its connection may have been you are in control the format of the data could be to reserve a structure at the beginning of the file to record whether it is locked or you just reserve a byte for this you could for that would mean the data file and that other values would represent the identifier of the machine currently writing to with adding a few things because jiri klouda correctly pointed out that uses that will result in the actual lock file being in an undetermined few ways to solve this the nfs directory with the or this is easy but completely guarantee data consistency between client and server though so there may still be issues although in your case it may be the lock file or data file using the the or this is supposed to disable caching will lower performance but will ensure be able to use to lock the data file but its implementation is spotty and you will need to check if your particular os actually uses the nfs locking it may do nothing at all the data file is then another client opening it for writing will and it seem to work on smb so probably best to just forget about use nfs and just use samba there is a article on the and why nfs is probably not the best answer to your usage will also find in this article various methods for locking solution is also a good if you want to keep things use nfs for files that are shared amongst multiple a small database server to save your data into and bypass the locking issues altogether or keep your current multiple data files system and just write a small utility to concatenate the may still be the safest and simplest solution to your

first bit of advice would if you ever find yourself saying using can create a then you should immediately start looking for a get out of the procedural mindset when using are still a few fuzzy parts to your does a call count as being during a minute period if it simply has any portion of the call during that for if a call starts at 1923 and lasts 62 seconds is it considered to overlap with all calls starting at going to assume yes on that but you can adjust the code below if not it should be a minor the breakdown to minutes i would usually use a table with time spans a start time and end time for each of the slices in which in your case since you are dealing with exact minutes and your start times are in minutes if the data type is screwed just going to use a single column with the exact minute in set up that table int not constraint primary key clustered insert into values 100 set if set set we can select for the outer join r between as as as carryover to as 60 need to either use that as a subquery to get the averages over a given since late on friday leave that step up to you one last i account for time spans that cross day boundaries go past hopefully the code points you in the right direction for a better approach might be to create a view that turns all of those nasty strings into actual datetime then this becomes really trivial with the minutes

first thought would have that objects are but if you get some input as string and have to search it in a small collection of guids changing it might be faster to store them as searching a string in a you have to parse the string error checking create the get the hash do the hash lookup and one final comparison of the guid searching a string in a you have to build the hash of the string faster than building the lookup the hash and do one string for you expect many guids not to be in the the hash comparison will fail often an you even have to do the string comparison takes slightly more time than the from point 1 you already have as input because you did some on the input of course far better to reuse them as index in the from point of view of design clarity is far more important than performance in of all you should use structures and only change if you really run into performance troubles profiling shows that you get an advantage out of the string

general way it is done is that the number of references to an object are kept track of in the and when that number goes to the object is subject to garbage however the gc will not fire up until it is explicitly needed because it is an expensive what happens when it starts is that the gc goes through the managed area of memory and finds every object that has no references the gc deletes those objects by first calling their allowing them to clean up after then frees the commonly the gc will then compact the managed memory area by moving every surviving object to one area of allowing more allocations to take i said this is one method that i know and there is a lot of research being done in this

have a winforms call it program a a user create a file and save some information to program a also exposes some public winforms application references program and uses some of its public some of program classes need to open the file the user created in order to retrieve data from in program the location of the file is saved in the settings of and are retrieved is a via is all well and good until program b runs when it runs and uses the classes from program a that need to read from program the settings are blank as if they were reset when you run program a for the first time or under a new user any settings are but any settings are reset to their default values they were set to in the ide when program a was is a public class public shared function as file return end end that the user has already run program a at least once and opened a so program should be program b calls it return anything because contain the file name more it contains whatever the value for that setting was set in the ide when you set up the setting in the first if you turn around and launch program it remembers the setting for the question when calling a function in a referenced why are the settings not is there an explanation for the behavior or am i missing something terribly or perhaps just going about this all and i have made any of the public classes in program a rely on anything in in the first happens to settings when a assembly is

have an interesting idea for a new programming based on a new programming paradigm that been working out in my head for some i finally got around to start working on a basic parser and interpreter for it a few weeks want my new language to be successful and i want to eventually create a community around it when ready to the idea behind it is fairly so i expect it to gain a lot of ground in the business but it would thrill me more than anything else to see a handful of start ups use or open source projects use taking those aims into what can i do to help make my language what do language projects do to become what should i avoid at all love to hear opinions or stories about other languages successful or not so i can think about them as i continue to the two biggest concerns on my mind are finding a access to existing having amazing tool what else might i add to this does it take to make a language

have an order class which goes through a series of defined to aid with i have implemented the state pattern such that the order object has a currentstate member which implements an iorderstate i then have concrete implementations of this interface such as orderstatedelivered etc question what is the correct way to transition the order object between is it acceptable to have an method which allows an external service to set the the criteria which determine the state changes are stored externally to the order object so this seems the obvious answer but slightly uneasy about having a public method on my object to change something as fundamental as thought it might be useful to add some more detail about my implementation because i wonder if actually using the pattern correctly in the first the pulbic api for creating and authorising an orderfacade as new order add lines this will validate the order and transition it to status valid this will commit the but only if it is at status result function looks something like function originalorder as as if dim validator dim valid if end return end end you can the currentstate member is the current iorderstate implementation which determines which activities are valid for the i wonder whether this should be responsible for determining the transition rather than the should an object using the state pattern be transitioned to the next

have found that generators are very helpful in cleaning up your code and by giving you a very unique way to encapsulate and modularize in a situation where you need something to constantly spit out values based on its own internal processing and when that something needs to be called from anywhere in your code not just within a loop or a block for generators are feature to abstract example would be a fibonacci number generator that does not live within a loop and when it is called from anywhere will always return the next number in yield yield while yield you have two fibonacci number generator objects which you can call from anywhere in your code and they will always return ever larger fibonacci numbers in sequence as lovely thing about generators is that they encapsulate state without having to go through the hoops of creating one way of thinking about them is as which remember their internal got the fibonacci example from and with a little you can come up with a lot of other situations where generators make for a great alternative to and other traditional iteration

have to disagree with nick on the notion of values ending up in the url in there is no try query string parameters can supply the model values with either difference which is possibly significant is that when passing id and name as those are the only two fields which can ever be when passing a person as an potentially other fields could be this may or may not be what you but updatemodel will accept a whitelist of properties like it to update similarly for binding a person instance in an so long as you remember to consider including a there is no real difference me the biggest difference between the two options you show is who is instantiating the person when you pass id and name as it will always be your controller code which instantiates the when you pass a person as an it will always be the model binder which instantiates the this could be significant rather than instantiating a new person you would like to materialize an existing instance from a

having a small problem with request caching using nsurlconnection asynchronous connections on the i know if i understood something or if cocoa is doing the opposite to what supposed to documentation for nsurlrequest says that the data for the url load should be loaded from the originating no existing cache data should be used to satisfy a url load that not only should the local cache data be but that proxies and other intermediates should be instructed to disregard their caches so far as the protocol if i send an nsurlrequest with nsurlrequestreloadignoringlocalcachedata is supposed to ignore local but use remote cache if the headers that are sent basic the status is 200 but if i use which is supposed to ignore both local and remote as the name one additional header is the response is 304 not checked the http and for it says any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that would have been returned in the response to a similar get request the on that then the server must not perform the requested method if the request method was get or the server should respond with a 304 it seems that if i use instead of ignoring the remote cocoa tells the remote server explicitly that it use remote and if i use it add that line and in effect the remote cache is not what exactly is happening did i miss or is cocoa setting a wrong nsurlrequest and remote

here is no compiler feature to do this for of having an have a base class or an is defined on the each enum member now becomes a class with different behaviour for you add a class extend the currently add an enum implement get a compiler lots of in code where you provide different behaviour in select statements is a smell that you may need to use best advice i can give is to build unit tests for each function that relies on the switch and call it for each value in the enumeration can get the values at runtime with the getvalues member on the enum	
hex such as hex can even read files while keeping a relatively small memory but still manage to keep scrolling looking for the best way to achieve and so i have several related i just use is its buffering based on the current seek it usually pagefault when scrolling if i create a wrapper for filestream which only uses seek will i hurt ability to buffer will performance suffer greatly from repeated even if seeks are can i rely on the buffering algorithm or the disk scheduler to keep performance it be better to use only really expect files up to maybe would pagefaults from scrolling create noticeable performance the data has to be should i render the whole file as a bitmap and invalidate parts of the image upon changes the scrolling control do its own paging on the or should i just generate the current display area on scroll in do i page the the generated or or do i them as what are the objects best suited to this is the best way to display large files without using large amounts of

hope you mind me editing the subject of your question but i think that you be so worried about the vst part of your software and the nature of your question is more about driver development than vst you are essentially trying to write a normal midi but you actually need to connect to any so writing a virtual driver is really not as hard as you you just need to find the driver the edit to my answer on your previous more thing i should add is that the best way to accomplish what you are trying to use a separate application with so that is to you write an application which initializes a midi device when and connects to the sequencer via your users would start up the sequencer then your then send the audio on a bus track to your and configure their sequencer to receive midi from the device driver which you would the streams audio from does some type of fft to get the pitches whatever you want to do to the audio and then pushes those events out to the host through the midi driver probably the best way to solve this problem if i understand your project

i agree btw this is a double please read want to know more than just maybe i should lay another accent then and rephrase one of my questions is os anything you can come up a general positioning of functional languages know this is probably a subjective sure a lot that could be learning haskell this have to struck by its sheer haskell is only one and i have no clue how one functional language differs from te next came across lots of imperative languages or in my and i as much as the next imperative cobol and are hardly if that much difference in functional is the choosing of one very relevant to which language to use is very dependant of the i can imagine that the answer on functional language to use for production as not the same as language to use to study the functional language so i very much would like positioning of the different which should i use when i need a which one have compilers for windows haskell functional and so functional programming language should i

i understand there are tasks that take a lot of is and as you just about every website has a registration process and the while i agree that implementing such features over and over again can be to some each application will have its own unique set of requirements meaning there will be at least a little customization work even if reusing code from an older i will now have a bash at answering your numbered zend use some of prototypes written to out a basic site i would not choose the zf for a nor would i use any mvc my current assumption is that a basic site consists of about 8 to 12 separate with no really special and finite remember that once we say there is almost always a noticeable performance in addition to whatever bugs and issues which might be inherent within that you speak of would be in the classes available within the zend for for creating a fully featured authentication system in about 15 or are there some site source to be built upon already though i have to my worst nightmare would be having to support an application built on some kind of framework that wraps another image how much fun debugging it would imagine how much fun teaching someone to support it would already using a not get greedy is there some app generator minor tool for pages with records not quite sure what you mean by but if i had to chance a perhaps zend

in java are pretty the fundamental problem sounds as if your original are already too small so scaling them up leaves you with a real simple approach is to have the images sent along with the app to be at the larger size and only scale i would say a policy on images sizes height and is necessary as you seem to indicate that only some have course if you can go for vector you can scale infinitely and this may be a better long term investments depending upon your application and the likely hood of needing to support large output formats just screens but it may well be fairly complex to approach things this information would be needed to help you further with the points in this

is answered in answer to can i tell whether a certain element is contained in a list or search the you could search through the list of all questions in using your favorite the command you can use the switch to perldoc to search for you would have found your answer by searching for of this answer contributed by anno siegel and brian d the word is an indication that you probably should have used a not a list or to store your hashes are designed to answer this question quickly and arrays being there are several ways to approach in perl and you can use the smart match operator to check that an item is contained in an array or a say array contains say hash contains earlier versions of you have to do a bit more if you are going to make this query many times over arbitrary string the fastest way is probably to invert the original array and maintain a hash whose keys are the first cerulean teal turquoise 1 you can check whether it might have been a good idea to keep the blues all in a hash in the first the values are all small you could use a simple indexed this kind of an array will take up less 1 or simply x you check whether the values in question are integers instead of you can save quite a lot of space by using bit strings 2017 1 check whether is true for some methods guarantee fast individual tests but require a of the original list or they only pay off if you have to test multiple values against the same you are testing only the standard module exports the function first for this it works by stopping once it finds the written in c for and its perl equivalent looks like this first my foreach return if speed is of little the common idiom uses grep in scalar context returns the number of items that passed its to traverse the entire this does have the benefit of telling you how many matches it grep eq you want to actually extract the matching simply use grep in list grep eq	
is at least as much a question about how method works in i think highlighted an interesting situation the first case the keyword on the the compiler decides to use the method overload with the parameter of type c because type is exactly equivalent to that of the parameter passed no implicit conversion is whereas an implicit conversion to the interface i would be required if the compiler were to choose the method that takes an argument of type i in other it chooses the more method the second case the keyword on the the compiler decides to use the overload of with parameter of type i because although you are overriding the method overload in the class it is effectively defined in the parent class making the method overload in fact the overload and therefore the most direct the first one the compiler this will help you to let me know if i need to clairfy any points if wrong about saying that the compiler does these then please correct though it makes little difference for the sake of the argument whether the compiler or it would

is true for all negative there is one more negative number than there are positive numbers for twos complement is valid for one more case than n 0 solution that is the same same as got you by one it is not valid for one case more as i just recognized by comment will just overflow thought about using mod 2 but it does not work to if done it will work for all numbers except because this will played with it for a looking for a nice bit manipulation but i could not find a nice while the mod 2 solution fits in n this becomes the static int32 return 2 n n get it working for all you have to replace with and include the calculation in an then you get even mapped to itself as unchecked negation by another answer i am going to explain how the function works and how to construct such a start at the very the function is repeatedly applied to a given value yielding a sequence of n question demands that is two successive applications of negate the two further applications of four in total negate the argument again yielding n n there is a obvious cycle of length substituting and noting that the obtained equation yields the n x n we get a cycle of length four with two numbers and the two numbers if you imagine the cycle as a negated values are located at opposite of many solution to construct such a cycle is the following starting from n negate and subtract 1 add negate and add n 1 subtract concrete example is of such an cycle is we are almost noting that the constructed cycle contains an odd positive its even and both numbers we can easily partition the integers into many such cycles is a multiple of and have found a function that satisfies the we have a problem with the cycle must contain x because zero is negated to and because the cycle states already it follows x 0 this is only a cycle of length two and is turned into itself after two not into luckily there is one case that solves the if equals zero we obtain a cycle of length one containing only zero and we solved that problem concluding that zero is a fixed point of we have zero is a fixed point leaving and we must partition that number into cycles of four bad that is not a multiple of four there will remain three numbers not in any cycle of length will explain the remaining part of the solution using the smaller set of 3 bit signed itegers ranging from to we are done with we have one complete cycle now let us construct the cycle starting at problem that arises is that is not representable as 3 bit we would obtain by negating to what is still a valid 3 bit integer but then adding one to yields interpreted as unsigned integer it is but we have to interpret it as signed integer so actually for this example or in the general case is a second fixed point of integer arithmetic negation and are mapped to so the cycle is actually as is a cycle of length two and additionally enters the cycle via in consequence is correctly mapped to itself after two function is correctly mapped to after two function but is erroneously mapped to itself after two function we constructed a function that works for all integers but can we do we we have to construct cycles of length four and are able to cover the whole integer range up to four the remaining values are the two fixed points and that must be mapped to themselves and two arbitrary integers and that must be mapped to each other by two function map to and vice versa they must form a four cycle and they must be located at opposite corners of that in consequence and have to be at opposite this will correctly map and but swap the two fixed points and after two function applications and leave us with two failing so it is not possible to construct a function that works for all but we have one that works for all values except one and this is the best we can

learning the linux on a x86 architecture using the gnu as one of the aha moments was the possibility of using these system calls come in very handy and are sometimes even necessary as your program in system calls are rather expensive in terms of performance as they require an interrupt of course a system which means that a context switch must be made from your current active program in to the system running in point i want to make is currently implementing a compiler a university and one of the extra features i wanted to add is the support for code in order to enhance the performance of the compiled because some of the code will be automatically generated by the compiler this will almost guarantee that there will be really tiny bits of code in it as in order to gain a performance i must be sure that using threads will make this fear however is in order to use i make system calls and the necessary the tiny little threads will therefore be highly affected by the time it takes to make these system which could even lead to a performance question is therefore twofold an extra bonus question underneath it possible to write which can run multiple on multiple cores the need of i get a performance gain if i have really tiny threads as in the total execution time of the performance or it worth the effort at guess is that multithreaded assembler code is possible without system even if this is the do you have a suggestion even some real for implementing threads as efficient as in x86 assembler the gnu

like said in his starting with lucene you can add to your just remember to use instead of rangequery when you treats numbers as so their order is means that for 12 is between 0 and if you want to do a proper numerical you need to index the numbers then do a range search of to amount of padding you need depends on the expected range of you have negative just add another zero for wrong see your numbers include a fraction leave it as and the integer part negative numbers are a bit since comes before gives a complete explanation about dealing with negative numbers and numbers in general in you have to numbers into something that makes the order of the items make

like the csv and answers at a the protocol buffer thing might be very similar to yaml for all i you need tightly packed records for high volume you might consider a textual file header describing the current file record sizes and field names read and parse the then use low level binary operations to load up each properties or whatever we are calling it this gives you the ability to change the strucutre a bit and have it be while still allowing you to pack a high volume in a smaller space than xml would i

like to think about tags as a fancy name for a always thought about them that and iirc in mercurial they are just in subversion as you they indeed are copies of to combine the two strategies for optimal tag and branch upon your tag is called branch bugfixes go into and bugfix releases are tags again may by a tag intended to alias at a certain not forget however that tags and branches in subversion are actually the same cheap the only difference between them is the semantics team attributes to so it pretty much boils down to getting people to agree on one particualr method and stick to that be enforced on the eg disallowing commits in except for release coordinators problem i see though with the second approach how are you going to make an easy distinction between software in the field if you that means that you may have a and another actually referring to a different code

little more insight in to what trying to accomplish might be ali already mentioned one way that your code could you could have your code add values to hidden form fields along with adding the rows on this would allow you to add rows at the browser level without requiring a post of the downside to this is that you will still need a page refresh before your server side code can process any of the second option is to implement some kind of ajax behavior on the this will allow your server side code to access the new row values as they are being added without requiring a total page since using you use ajax but you could try never tried it but better than hand rolling your

made this more browser friendly html public xhtml body 0 20px 0 div 0 1px solid the 90s we saw the rise of guis i know macs were around in the 80s but guis became the standard for everyone once windows took this transition had many casualties like lotus was basically killed by excel on and wordperfect word killed now you can argue that ms had the inside track since they also produced windows and be right but beyond that i think ms adjusted to the change quicker than anyone was still an agile little company back it adjusted and took its highly successful turbo pascal and created chapter 7 for further truly compiled languages ruled the roost in the 1990s with the exception of one little which was something basically it was sorta sorta interpreted compiled into bytecode that ran on a virtual i personally think that the rise of both java and netscape scared the absolute bejesus out of microsoft in the late chapter 9 for further adjusted reasonably well producing what was really the first really successful java ide in were fending off a resurgent microsoft who also produced successive versions of visual studio that were years ahead of their time in the late i can remember coding visual with mts transaction dcom objects over 10 years ago and that was a precursor to the modern application server platform we have remote debugging and the like were things that were at least light years ahead on visual in response to the text selection i tried it with absolute which you can do by changing this it still selects the only way i see around this is to change your page into a column format where the side notes are in other the only problem with this is that you lose the ability to move the notes in relation to the or at least i think of a way around

martin by default most jms implementations will process message selectors on the they are part of a durable when jms implementations will process them on the server as well to avoid too many messages getting persisted when a significant reduction in the number of messages that get past the some systems allow you to specify that message selectors should be processed on the which is a good option in a case where you have excess cpu available on your message brokers but not on your in mind that while selection is usually it can be quite because if you want to listen to 5 different you have to have 5 different each of those in a naive driver implementation is a different and that can start to add for that it is often useful to support both from publication so that some clients can listen only to the topics that they and others can listen to the topic hierarchies they want with message selectors should always test against your application and your every broker handles the situation and every application functions you just say use technique because each technique for message processing has different thing to bear in mind with message selectors is that they dynamically so you have the possibility of losing messages or having to manually manage a complicated switchover imagine the following use are listening to a message selector of the form in wants to start listening to have to shut down the old messageconsumer and start a new one with a selector in the form in the you either lose messages you shut down the old one before starting the new or you have to manually remove duplicates you have the new one started before the old

miss having overloaded operators in especially in the following class that is an algorithm or a chain of the natural thing is to overload every programmer comes up with incompatible and thus names for so clarity is because these names forced to use make their meaning class that has a conversion to another in operator and works both for actual conversion and for yielding an internal member of the desired the second case comes up a lot in java when a class is unnecessarily final but you want to add operations to decoratedstringbuffer stringbuffer as string is private string public string final string public string other forwarding decoratedstringbuffer before it leaves your code and returns to the client it needs to be converted presumably by a function that finally applies the suffix and it would be great if we could call that operator even greater if like could apply one because no we have to give it a name that is necessarily more is one obvious but to many java imply a corresponding which we even if it imply the is the stringbuffer getting the one we operate or something is a better and the pattern i tend to but then someone reading the code wonders why what looks like a getter is called except in designing numerical classes or cocatenatable little use for overloading and as java like not much use for java trying to make everything act like a primitive int value and the conversion operators i

my experience there are only two kinds of error those specific to the application developing and those generated by an api your application depends first type you will almost always need to write the second type depends on whether you want to show it to the some are worded simply enough you can just pass it along to the user but in most cases the error messages produced by an api are intended for developers and would only confuse an end instance most operating systems have a not error message or something assuming the file you attempting to open was chosen by the user it makes sense to pass this error from the os directly to the while a by error would not help the user unless you application performs calculations directly entered by the for most circumstances this error would mean a programming application specific the error message is only useful within the context of where it this is why you find a collection of generic error generic error messages usually give the user enough information to know how to	
my i have a nullable bit column and another developer recently made a change to a stored procedure to only show values where the bit column was not true because this is a nullable we noticed that if the column was the record was not being picked why is the other developer and i agree that null is this a bug in sql or was this designed this seems like a design 1 or voidedindicator is jon is a nullable bit field so it can have the following or a sql statement is created with a where clause such as we only get records returned that have voidedindicator but we were expecting both voidedindicator 0 and voidedindicator is why is why are null values filtered out within this where

my opinion there some things you should think the customer need a function to customize his there a lot of different attributes or the effort of creating such an worth i think that its pretty obvious why you should think about it really depends on your project if that kind of model makes you want to create some a lot of forms that can be customized at runtime then this model could be pretty if you need to do a lot of smaller tools and you use this as some kind of then this effort could be worth it because you can save a lot of that kind of you could automatically add error check the values or add other things that are always build up with the same but if you have too many of this elements or attributes then the performance can go down things that becomes interesting in bigger projects that changes that have to occur in each form just have to be made in the not in each this could save a lot of time if there is a bug in the finished our company we use a similar model for an interface generator between now i cant remember the right word for and our just that it doesnt create an but an output file for one of the use xml to define the structure and how the values need to be converted and so

my the primary value of stored procedures has been eliminated with for a long the key value of using stored procedures was to encapsulate the sql in a form where you would naturally use parameterized this provided a layer of security to the developer with respect to sql since linqtosql queries by parameterized i find that my use of stored procedures has been reduced not to say that there still a place for but now i feel that you should only use them when they provide significant value over a parameterized linq query in terms of less complexity or increased perhaps because of the ability to optimize for the removing over dependence on stored i results in a more maintainable code base as most of the code is located in your ide instead of being split between your database and your that you can still use stored procedures with i just find much value in doing i think of a single stored procedure that written since switching to though i have written a few functions to perform specific these get dropped onto my datacontext and appear as methods that i can invoke to get the appropriate entities from the db using the

need the proper terminology for a specific type of you write a function in your sql whose inputs and outputs are contained within the scope of a database if you call this function in the scope of a database all the data used by the function is available within the same it can query a database but it read a file from the or ping a web if you call the function twice within a single transaction with you should get the same even if other clients are making changes in the the function has no except within the same transaction changes in state outside the scope of the database transaction are not the function send nor write to the nor store a value in if the function changes data within the okay because if the calling transaction is rolled then the effects of the function are arguments of the function are since basically used as would be the proper term for a function of this really seem to be specific how would you describe this class of for your but none of them is exactly what i had in idempotent gets so i marked that as the accepted but each of you got an upvote from me have no and their result is based solely on their the result given the same arguments is always this work because the database functions i have in mind can be based on the state of and the function can also affect the state of can return a result based on the state of and given the same state of the result is always but this work for what i have in mind the effects of an idempotent functions must result in an unchanging result no matter how many times the function is but no distinction between changes made within transaction isolation and changes made external to that for a deterministic function with no

not information which a server gives out to clients by the only way to know is keep opening connections until it fails or ask the server owner to offer a service you can poll which returns this after thinking some more about this not sure if possible to determine this via with any real degree of if the server returned server when it reached its connection limit i assumed would happen when i made my original it would be easier to but generally when servers go over their connection they simply respond until a new connection is the client simply waits for a there is no hard way to distinguish between a server which took 10 seconds to respond because its connection limit had been and a server which took 10 seconds to respond for any other even if you still attempted to test it in this the requests you make to the server would need to stay open long enough to ensure that the connection you create all subsequent are still open when the nth request times that would mean either calling a service which takes an arbitrarily long time to return a process or a or download an inconveniently large either approach is extremely inefficient at

not sure i am fully but when you create an event you can say that it bubbles and so when it dispatches it will believe that would allow you to attach an event listener to your city for the right types of events and that would catch events thrown by i ever tried this though so i am not i realize you are from the following and bubbling happen as the event object moves from node to node in the display for capturing and for this process has nothing to do with the inheritance only displayobject objects objects such as containers and can have a capturing phase and a bubbling phase in addition to the targeting only way i can see around this would be for you to register the child with the parent car with the every time a new one is added as a at that point you could add an event listener in the parent and then an event from the parent any time a event is handled from the child its ugly i and you would want to make sure you remove the event listener anytime that you remove a but the only real solution i can

not sure i fully understand the question but i think you are wanting to create a collection of polymorphic when accessing a polymorphic you must always refer to it by a is an first you need to set up a base class to derive your objects virtual void create the array of i use an stl set because that makes it easy to add and remove members at add an create a derived class and instantiate enemy public virtual void rendering code goes to access just iterate through it it create different types of just derive more classes from class forget to delete the objects when you remove them from the

not sure if interpreting you but the standard way is to use a a two step the given determine whether each pixel is an edge pixel process creates a new a standard way to do this is the binary image of edge apply the hough the basic idea for each edge compute all lines through and then take the lines that went through the most edge apparently looking for the how you do that the canny edge detector actually gives you a gradient also just the so if you pick an edge pixel and follow along that find the next edge keep going until you hit an edge pixel and your	
not sure if they are completely interchangeable in this specific since you are basing the size of an array member on the i believe that it has to be an enumerated i have the time to look it up in the but i would be surprised if you can use an member as an array size even if it is since the actual value might not be visible in the in myclass static const int int in const int in think that the compiler can compile without having already compiled most other i would say with the class static option since it will participate a little more intelligently in type deduction and i only use enumerated integer constants when i really need to or when they are truly enumerated constants just took a look at the standard whilst i was munching away on lunch for the nudge can involve only literals variables or static data members of integral or enumeration types with constant expressions template parameters of integral enumeration and looks like the constant and enum will both work provided that you provide the constant initializer in the declaration is that

noting that the reason actually that the size of the enum is not yet known after forward you use forward declaration of a struct to be able to pass a pointer around or refer to an object from a place refered to in the forward declared struct definition itself declaring an enum would not be too because one would wish to be able to pass around the enum you even have a pointer to because i recently got told some platforms use pointers of different size for char than for int or so it all depends on the content of the current standard explicitly disallows doing something like but the next standard due to next year allows the which convinced me the problem actually to do with the underlying x known as a enum you can even use x in the following and its enumerators can later be defined in a later redeclaration of the see in the current working

object contains entries for all its plus extra space to hold a pointer to the the vmt holds more than just i explain about the at my web including a delphi 2009 introduces another hidden field in addition to the vmt pointer to hold the synchronization you can determine whether it is added at the beginning or at the end of the class with some simple ttest obj objaddr fieldaddr it prints the value then the monitor field must be at the end of the object because 4 only accounts for the size of the vmt if it prints the value then the monitor field must be at the adjacent to the vmt expect find the monitor at the it means that the layout of the descendant object simply the layout of the base object with all the new fields it would mean the offset of the monitor field depends on the type of the and that makes the implementation more a class implements an the object layout includes more hidden the fields contain pointers to the when you have an reference to an the pointer it holds the same as the pointer to the vmt which is what you have with an ordinary object the pointer value will be the address of the hidden written about the layout of classes that implement	
object of type cannot be bound to a for exactly the same reason that a cannot be converted to a allowing it would allow the programmer or to break type safety without a animal dangerousshark public animal cutekitten public animal animalptrref dangerousshark an illegal function think that some of the confusion arises because of the loose use of the words and be unlike objects which can be so in the context of references when we speak of conversion we can only be concerned about initializing a new are always bound to an and from the question it was clear that he is aiming to get a reference that is a direct bind to an existing this is only allowed if the object used to initialize the reference is with the type of the this is only if the types are the or the type of the object is derived from the type of the reference and the reference type is at least as as the initializing in pointers to different types are not regardless of the relationship of the other a reference can be initialized with something that can be converted to the reference in these the reference must be const and not volatile and the conversion will create a temporary and the reference will be bound to this temporary and not the original as pointed this is not suitable for the requirements of motivating a can be bound directly to a but a cannot be directly bound to a a can be initialized with a but the reference will actually bind to a temporary object from the

of variables in memory short the past computers had an 8 bits this that each clock cycle 8 bits of information could be which was fine came 16 bit due to downward compatibility and other the 8 bit byte was kept and the 16 bit word was each word was 2 and each clock cycle 16 bits of information could be but this gave a small look at a memory each address there is a which can be accessed words can only be fetched at even so if we read a word at we read the bytes at 0000 and but if we want to read the word at position we need two read first and then and we only keep course this took some extra time and that was not so why they invented so we store word variables at word boundaries and byte variables at byte if we have a structure with a byte field and a word field a very naive we get the is not but when using word alignment we memory is sacrificed for access can imagine that when using double word or quad word this is even more why with most modern compilers you can chose which alignment you are using while compiling the

older c and compilers were purely based on low level coding where higher standards of data protection were not and they can not even be typically in c and you can write anything you can even write a code to access and modify your const pointers as if you know how to play with the does enforce some compile level but there is no protection on you can certainly access your own and use its values to manipulate any data that came in const pointer as is the reason was invented where little higher level standards are enforced because whatever you access is it is a fixed structure governing all rules of data protection and it has hidden pointer which can not be accessed and nor major difference can only give you compile time but will give you protection even at

one is similar to the way i achieved the same sort of thing is to put a couple of values in to a table in the one is the to take the system and the other is a the date field is not then block all and on every page just use a javascript alert to display the message to users explaining that the site will be taken down in x for y reason and should be back online in z this is an annoying and way to do but really quite important that they realise that they start filling in a really long after that maintenance start then boot all users on their next page for of all the clients to periodically poll the server to check for an impending maintenance period is if you do have a couple of pages which have really long then perhaps add the ajax polling just on those these sort of values in the database is easy to is quite and is perfect for this

only place where you effectively need to call yourself is when concatenating s there are some situations where the call is made by the such as in than the compiler will only convert a type if it is known to be compatible base class or implementing an interface or via an explicitly coded conversion when you use a cast and the compiler knows that the types cannot be compatible not in the same inheritance and not it will also say that it cannot convert the same goes for generic type	
only safe way to deal with this is to ensure that you do not have a loss of conversion at the assert code will only work during debug builds and will allow for a conversion loss in retail the conversion loss is bad because it will pass around a completely incorrect size for the you really need is a mechanism to prevent you from creating data i reccomend using a class like this will prevent a conversion which overflows or underflows by means of throwing an size throws if size fit in an unsigned

optimiser will make its decision based on the relative cost of the full table scan and using the this mainly comes down to how many blocks will have to be read to satisfy the the rule of thumb mentioned in another answer is in some cases a full table scan will make sense even to get of the rows if those rows happen to be spread around many consider this create table t1 as select from alter table t1 modify update t1 set 2 where 3 rows analyze table t1 compute select from t1 where is not 861 you can only approximately of the rows in t1 have a but due to the way i built the these 861 rows will be spread more or less evenly around the the from t1 where is not likely to visit almost every block in t1 to get even if the optimiser used the it makes sense then to dispense with the index and go for a full table key statistic to help identify this situation is the index clustering select from where value 460 is quite high to the 861 rows in the and suggests that a full table scan will be see dbazine article on clustering

our current amazingly used 6 different tracking tools versions of mostly my opinion on the ones that listed them in order of my most favored to teamtrack we use a web the interface is performance will vary across but comparing with our same data in each this works the it also works in quality center this is also web but it is ie on the well easy to and it has reasonable performance for us as has an odd feature where there a save it saves automatically for to force a you have to navigate to another also when you first use it has to install so many dlls that it is practically a thick that being the ie sometimes gets locked up when trying to reinitialize a session after session once locked you occasionally have to kill ie to regain i use this as thoroughly as the other so this a fair we used it briefly for some internal i suppose the big upside is the i just find the interface as nice and easy to use as the other its been awhile so i apologize for lack of specifics for why relegating it below the there much to like about their defect tracking tool apart from that it is better than the interface seems as if the siebel interface has a set of user interface controls and it tries to force all square pegs into its round another downside is that it uses lengthy generated ids so its hard to reference them or search by along with the ticket ids pvcs we had separate databases and used both the web client and thick its been awhile so the details are i recall there were bugs in the tool and they getting for instance reports display certain performance was it took a long time to it was slow to navigate through

point of seaside is not really to be like desktop though it does try to take much of the pain out of web seaside is known for two things which you might consider continuations to allow you to write processes that prompt the user for blocks to provide into your code whenever links are forms things vastly simplify certain web development though the first ends up being used fairly infrequently in provides many other ability to write web applications in smalltalk productive and reusable can delegate to other which replaces just that part of the management of session state and certain state can be marked to be rolled back whenever the user uses the back button so it always has the correct value when callbacks are very nice canvas api for programatically generating ability to debug and fix errors live on a running of these are not unique to seaside but they are somewhat so how is it different from other web you get to write in you have to mentally back and forth between code and a templating you have to worry about form field you want you probably hate web programming as much if you use may discover seaside because of its programming but they usually hang around for all the other

project managers necessarily have a programming they should be familiar with the stages of the software development life cycle but that the same as programming to my the natural way of evolution is into team lead or group manager which is different than project pm should be a good maanger with a basic understanding of a software development methodology and people skills to handle the execution of the project plan and its there necessarily a need for fundamental knowledge about the technology i use since in a sense that can become quite the rabbit hole to jump how much about iis and would they have to know and then the differences between versions that can add some more to the had pretty good experience with each kind of manager in terms of project some that came from a programming background gave the ease of bonding over horror stories in using this or that for developing stuff and i enjoyed working with them as some ideas ever seem to go out of others that seem to have a technical background may still be good if they have the other key attributes like attention to methodical and creativity to handle changes to the which is the same as writing to my mind is almost purely design and implementation which ignores the other elements of designing software which includes the earlier stages like requirements gathering and analysis as well as the end stages of deployment and

reason is that you specify a on your the radius is anything less than 100 when the property will make it jump up to 100 and likely cause a you have two competing animations and the mouse events go crazy as the ellipse radius flickers underneath the solution is to just omit the this will cause the animation to start from wherever the current radius describes an an unrelated when you set it speed up your child it will just end the you really want to set on your child modified the xaml above to do	
reasons could of the queries only run against the initial set of making for faster queries in additional tables were added after the initial development and an alter table command may have been prohibitively was an initial intention to make contacts of one specific type or another but descended from a parent was a need for multiple child rows for a given parent this would be in the case of an indexed key as opposed to a so it might not seen systems where a structure like this would actually speed things up a bit because of the smaller queries and the smaller associated tables being kept in a memory cache at the logic

refer to any length of a single operation could take ms on a webservice and 100 seconds in a database and they both could be using hard to know quite what if asking whether accessing a local database is generally faster than accessing a similar service over the then i expect the answer is that the local database will be the call over the internet to the web service has a lot of overhead and communication over internet is relatively evan on a slow computer a databases can perform many thousands of simple queries per contrast that with access over the where be lucky to get 50 round trip requests per not even accounting for time it takes to perform the requested operation on the asking whether a server on the web can serve data faster by avoiding a database and calculating results then the answer is it the call to the database in this case adds unnecessary overhead if the data in it can be easily calculated in a the answer to this question really have anything to do with a is it faster to calculate an answer in a function or to access the answer using a query on a as i the answer would depend on the complexity of the particular function you had to and weighing its computation time against the overhead of accessing the answer part of the directly from a the answer to your question depends on what exactly it would also probably help to know asking the i have a suspicion that the real answer is that this probably something you need to worry not really a practical concern unless you have a particular situation requiring concerned about comparison of speed when webservice and database are both on a pretty sure the overhead of the db is a less than the the application typically maintains a stateful to the while requests to a webservice are via which is relatively higher and could be best answer would be to whip up a simple and measure time it takes to retrieve results using both and create an app that opens a lot of threads and do some load if your app maintain an open connection or have access to a pool of connections with the then the db alternative may well be initial creation of a db connection can be relatively but that figure into since you should write your app so that an open connection is always

safest approach is to fall back to the lowest version you need to that assumes all versions are backwards compatible which necessarily the that solution appropriate or desirable then i fall back to the is by far the most popular and common di framework but no means the only is another you can even roll your own if undesirable to add a complete framework for i have problems envisioning a java a i do without using simply too say there are 4 versions of a relevant the api has changed twice in that time so you have 3 different api you need to abstract use of that jar to an api of your own that is consistent across all these versions and then create three implementations of one for each different api spring you create an application which defines all your beans and how injected into other there is no reason you choose or build and application context as part of a build often properties are used for this but you could also include part of the application context this way key point here is that even though the apis are different you need to abstract away those differences as far as your code is if you just asking for trouble and it just gets

the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getters and setter getters and so or should i take encapsulation in healthy measures and leave the field as a public encapsulation has nothing to do with wrapping a around a private in small or when writing the tradeoff is but when left unchecked in a system like the one its a an problem with is that they create overly tight coupling between the object with those methods and the rest of the of the advantages of real encapsulation is that it reduces the need for getters and decoupling your object from the rest of the system in the than exposing the implementation of gamecharacter with why not give gamecharacter an interface that better reflects role in the game instead class private intelligence public intelligence return public void not try better class public void todo update public int even still interface public void might update public int class ogre implements never increases intelligence after grabbing other a gamecharacter can grab the effect of each gamecharacter grabbing the same gameobject can but the details are fully encapsulated within each gamecharacter how the gamecharacter is now in charge of handling its own intelligence update which can happen as it grabs for the setter the complications you note with having have you might be able to dispense with the getintelligence method depending on the allen holub takes this idea to its but but that approach seem to be very

the last line of my code where i try to print the pathway i have to basically guess the number of slots the user is there a better way to print a for and so you get a new line after each can i print the number that the user entered in the pattern as shown each you need to record the number of balls which ended up in that and the maximum for any given these two you can loop over each and print or the appropriate number of times with a nested there any other problems with my only appear to be printing the path of the last ball rather than each but that might just be your indentation being post properly complete example output you have seems to be reading input from the not using declaring variables too better to declared variables on first and if they change mark them if you int slots at least one of your bugs would be caught by the

think come up with the solution to match the behaviour of in your subscribe to the keyboard so you know when the keyboard will show and and the system will tell you the size of the but forget to unregister in your the methods similar to the below so that you adjust the size of your tableview to match the visible area once the keyboard here tracking the state of the keyboard separately so i can choose when to set the tableview back to full height since you get these notifications on every field forget to implement and choose somewhere appropriate to fix your tableview cgrect keyboardheight if keyboardisshowing cgrect frame the scrolling we work out a few sizes then we see where we are in the visible and set the rect we want to scroll to to be either the half view above or below the middle of the text field based on where it is in the in this we have an array of uitextfields and an enum that keeps track of so multiplying the rowheight by the row number gives us the actual offset of the frame within this outer cgrect frame cgfloat rowheight if rowheight else if rowheight else if rowheight else if rowheight cgfloat viewheight cgfloat halfheight viewheight cgfloat midpoint if seems to work quite

think this is completely solvable in using only you know the calling convention used by the target for there is a risk that you end up the or at least having to what if the compiler decided to build the registered function using arguments passed in perhaps due to some optimization setting what if it was built with a different also no way in general to express in c that you want to call a function with a given set of and that the values for the arguments need to be unpacked from a buffer of random could do something horrible like void const void signature case int x void case quite clear that this live on the same continent as you could of course this for some reasonable set of return types and argument still be a bit out in the cold for casting function pointers but that might be still always run the risk of someone handing you a signature that you have code

think we recently had a similar afair solution was to give a self animal self get return could then be casted to correct what happens is that your original object has a reference to nhibernate proxy object lazily which acts as animal for all methods exposed via animal class passes all calls to the loaded however it cannot be casted as any of your other animals because it is none of it only emulates the animal however the class that is encapsulated by animalproxy can be casted as subclassed animal because it is a real instance of correct you only need to get to

this answer is based on the idea that need to do similar things for different entities and different properties elsewhere in your if you need to convert the list of viewvalues to a list of longs by then stick with your original if you want a more reusable read would declare an interface for the interface public result you can write a single generic conversion results new for element return you can define simple projections like static final new public long return apply it just like ids using bracing and longer lines makes the projection declaration a bit shorter all of this would be a lot nicer with lambda but never

this fails the constraint it basically doubles the space i very much doubt that a solution which do that without wrecking the runtime complexity somewhere making note that this change the of the space if got a stack with space this will still be just with a different constant a stack of of all values lower in the when you pop the main pop the min stack when you push the main push either the new element or the current whichever is is then implemented as just using your stack min top popping twice you stack min let me know if this enough simple when you grok but it might take a bit of at first downside of course is that it doubles the space execution time suffer significantly though still the same a variation which is slightly more but has better space in we still have the min but we only pop from it when the value we pop from the main stack is equal to the one on the min we only to the min stack when the value being pushed onto the main stack is less than to the current min this allows duplicate min is still just a peek for taking the original version and pushing 1 stack min top from the above pops from both stacks because 1 stack min top again pops from the main because 5 stack min again pops both stacks because 1 stack min ends up with the same worst case space complexity the original but much better space usage if we rarely get a minimum or an implementation of evil i tested it but i okay class private readonly stack new could pass this in to the private readonly comparer private t public t get return public void if 0 currentmin public t t ret if currentmin return

to make sure on the same are more than one type of control you can build in depending on what kind of control you build you can normally only get designer support for a control from visual studio at the time when you are developing the the time you are developing the page where the control will be but controls that are not supported will just show up as grey this was a major failure of visual but i i have seen this limit overcome by using an control with no that out of the move sounds like in this case working with a in because server controls get designer support from visual studio when building the page where the control is you need to make the control available to the controls are normally compiled down to a dll you must include a reference for this file in your at this point you should be able to right click in your toolbox and select this will present you with a dialog box that will allow you to select your at this point your controls should show up in the visual studio can at time be quirky about adding these you may need to restart visual studio for them to be note that i still use visual studio so hopefully things have improved in this respect for

too am a big fan of spring when used in conjunction with spring which is just now webflow can be used with other web frameworks but most natural fit is with spring my case i went from struts to spring we had a lot of built up infrastructure for using one thing i underestimated when writing new pages in spring mvc is how much time we would spend essentially reinventing that talking common logic and so i know a whole lot about it sounds like having that problem you would with any web the fact that that process is still going on may be a real you ignore the fact that have it with something else find spring mvc and webflow are best once you have some infrastructure around validations and forms for we had this process a lot on our places validates parameters and either rejects order to or accepts verified order is returned to displayed to the user who confirms that they either want to place the order or cancel they cancel display a page saying it has been they approve verify the order it fails validation return to place the order and display the result to the may sound convoluted but it came up a where spring mvc really shines is for this kind of scenario you can create a custom controller and then the actual implementation just becomes an issue of plugging in the right views and support underestimate the cost of developing and testing required other thing to consider is team if noone else has spring mvc experience then going to present some be very careful taht you change just because make you personally more

understand what you mean with did lazy lazy loading is a it is turned on by default and you can turn it off if you like are two kinds of lazy for references to other entities and for this int id private reference to another user myuser list to other mycomments loading on the reference to you have lazy loading on the you need to define all members of the user class nhibernate will create a so called the proxy is a classed defined at runtime which derives from your code is accessing it as user and is not aware that is is a but when you access one of its members the first the properties are loaded from the you want to turn off lazy loading on the user you need to do this in its nhibernate creates always instances of type no you need to have anything loading on the list of you use lazy loading on the list of it is the list itself that implements the lazy if you access the list the first it is loaded from the nhibernate uses a list that implements but is not you want to turn off lazy loading in the you do this in the mapping of lazy loading is a good and you application does not have to care about it but there are some for if you serialize a and it is a you get a not initialized proxy instead of anything lazy loading only works as long as the session is it is not always faster to use lazy if you need to load all the data its faster to load it in one the configuration needs to be done answer your original is lazy loading required for is lazy loading required in my most probably only small and rather trivial applications need lazy if you have a system with many persistent need lazy

was intended as a comment on a previous but i guess too a child class with a constructor that takes an instance of a parent class and copies data from it is a fairly widespread one way to minimize the headache that this can cause with multiple levels of inheritance and other classes is to create a protected function that does this in this instance call it consider that we have three and they each inherit from the other in that class private string public string get return set name protected void name we define class employee private int public public public int get return set employeeid protected new void employeeid we follow the same example for class manager private string public public public string get return set department protected new void department the method in each class declared so that we can change the and is there to provide shallow copy functionality to inherited note that this pattern creates a new object that just has the same data as the old the old object still exists and existing references point to your new actually changing an type is not

will begin to use c for an operating systems course soon and reading up on best practices on using c so that headaches are reduced later has always been one my first questions regarding arrays as they are easy to screw it a common practice out there to bundle an array and its associated variable containing length in a never seen it in books and usually they always keep the two separate or use something like kind of with wrapping the two into a be able to pass the struct both by value and by reference which you really do with arrays unless using in which case you have to again keep track of the array am beginning to use c so the above could be horribly i am still a it a best practice to wrap arrays and their length variable in a struct in

windows console follows the same line ending convention that is assumed for or for that matter for physical it needs to see both cr and lf to properly move to the next there is a lot of software infrastructure between an ansi c program and that in any standard c library function is going to try to do the right assuming allowed it the this is why and modifiers for the parameter were default for most and in particular for and then any printed is converted to a crlf and the reverse happens for to turn off that use the the terminals traditionally hooked to boxes including the dec vt100 emulated by xterm also needs both cr and in the the conversion from a newline character to a crlf sequence is handled in the tty device driver so most programs need to know about and the and modifiers are both on those if you need to send and receive characters on a tty without that you need to look up or the system calls it depends your otherwise ansi c program is avoiding c library to the console because you need access to the character color and other then whether you need to send cr or not will depend on which win32 api calls you are using to send the	
windows driver available from the linked microsoft has extensive documentation and examples on writing printer you can check the online driver of the ddk docs before downloading one commercial alternative that would probably be much quicker to deploy is rather pricy for a developer for a server but from what heard their support is rather good so if the price is tenable for you this may be a good also sdk from but i find any pricing info and know anything about on your usage another option would be something like which has printer capture facilities this is not a

would expect foreach to work nominally faster in some and the about same in except in cases where the items are an actual array in which case the performace difference is it is implemented on top of an it be more efficient than a straight depending on unlikely to be less for if someone exposed a balanced tree as both indexable and then foreach will be decently this is because each index will have to independently find the referenced while an enumerator has the context of the current node to more efficiently navigate to the next you have an actual then it depends on the implementation of the language and class whether foreach will be faster for the same as indexing is a literal memory as then for should be marginally faster since avoiding a function if indexing is an indirection just like a then it should be the that being i find it hard to find a case for generalization this is the last sort of optimization you should be looking even if there is a performance problem in your if you have a performance problem that can be solved by changing how you you really have a performance you have a because someone wrote either a really crappy or a really crappy

years ago i needed to know about the network bandwidth being used by all the applications on a windows a clue as to the magnitude of the task i was i proceeded to learn how to write a tdi filter took about two two years since i was living off some stock ndis is easier than prolly as the man one year full can do firewall stuff at the tdi level and nice since you can associate sockets with applications you do at you can also block bandwidth shape you can block but you really shape receives at because not allowed to pause receive code path executes at i figured out a way around that and took a patent out on but i recommend it from a technical a real hacker will simply bypass tdi and talk directly to the ndis a tdi firewall is

you apply some ddd logic which compliments the in the state of the ui belongs in the application which can talk directly with the domain and infrastructure layers and the concept of ddd makes you about how to solve the solution in code step through the progress state you want to maintain here is the step or progress of the my first step would be to document progress or such step get step get in this i would apply logic to the model to the next most likely with a method on the a registrationservice but it belongs in the app would create a service in the application layer called i would place a method on here called but the domain would not hold the state of the model in this want to focus the state at the application so in this would act upon not a model object it is not part of the domain but instead the you need something to retain the state of the registration away from the domain how about a now we know we have to retain the state of something in the mvc allows for a concept called viewmodels not sure what ror calls a viewmodel represents the model that will be displayed by the partial viewmodel would be an excellent place to save the state of this call and stick a method on of means that the application layer would have to retain the location of the and the application layer would change the internals of it based on nextstep if it is you may want to create a in the application layer and place the within it to abstract your logic to pass the viewmodel final piece is how to track the state of that since web applications are you have to retain control by some other means then the in this i would revert to serializing the viewmodel to the client and letting the client pass it back and or keep a copy of the and pass some type of identifier back and forth to the client and is a good example to think as i have not performed this myself for the most secure and insured way of saving the state of this viewmodel is to persist it to the via the infrastructure layer the app layer can talk directly to the infrastructure that seems a lot of work to for something that may die off and i would have partial registrations sitting in my would keep the private info cc all on the server side and not pass it back and an after walking through we came up a in the application a with a in the application is persist the viewmodel to the database through the infrastructure you never have to track what on the view or ui as the viewmodel gets updated and updated persisted to as you move your next concern would be to in the this is easily done with 1 using step or named but i am writing code below as that is my class registrationcontroller public actionresult return and this posts back to note the setting of property on the model public actionresult registrationprogressviewmodel the logic in here checks business rules around the verifies if valid it increases and finally the viewmodel to the db through the switch case wire up the view for step2 return case wire up the view for step3 return case wire up the view for step4 return return to first return notice that this abstracts the of verifying the internal state into the the your url is a nice and clean post which expects a viewmodel with specific properties filled if the viewmodel is not does not advance to the next

you are looking specifically for files that contain only or mostly regular then statistics should tell you that a certain file contains more of that syntax than so you could define a set of and combine their scores into a metric that scored a file on how likely it was to be of pick a cutoff and let it some of more than one of a standard code compressible i but the compactness of regex grammar would intuitively be harder to compress than normal if this is just a then probably best off using and manually paring down the is there anything in particular in the you are looking that might be easier to pick up

you ask about an you can just easily get a pointer to its so it basically boils down to the question whether pointers can be used transparently with stl a pointer actually is the most powerful kind of an there are different only forward and and only only forward and and only only and forward and and access arbitrary steps forward and backward in one and each iterator in the second group supports all the things of all iterators mentioned before a pointer models the last kind of iterators a random access you may an arbitrary integer and you may read and and all except the output iterator has a that can be used to access a member of the element type we iterate iterators have several typedefs as what the iterator iterates over reference to the pointer to the what type the distance between two iterators has by this is a it is typedefed to a type that represents the kind of the either algorithms can use it to overload on different kinds of iterators is faster for random access because it can just return a pointer of course does not have those has an template and specializes it for so if you want to get the value type of any you whether it is a pointer or some other it will give you the of that a pointer can very well be used with stl as someone else even can be a a pointer is a very good example of an iterator because it is so exceedingly simple but at the same time so powerful that it can iterate over a	
you be able to return a list of anonymous types unless you cast them to and have the signature define the return type as suitable your other issue is that the subquery for state will actually return an instead of a single entry can use the extension method with ef to get the first matching although if you have the foreign key relationship the model should have setup an navigation property for the state as well and you should be able to use the property attached instead of a so if you would like to have this as a method call that returns a list of objects you will have to create a type that represents the transform or downcast to otherwise you could do it at the form level all depends on your where you are attempting to bind the var results from r in select state state not hostaddress timestamp return like i said the other alternative is to either create a class for the transform or bind the list directly to the class public string state public string hostaddress public datetime timestamp just add the class to the ala new and change the method signature to reflect the class and remove the cast in the

you follow the steps to define an instrumentation class the which involve specifing a slightly different set of attributes in the of you must specify a attribute that gives the full of the class that implements in your your agent uses any then you should specify the since your instrumentation agent will need its libraries to be visible from the bootstrap if you do you will probably have to use the wacky argument to the the argument is a decent way to get things but you want to use this attribute in the because the is already growing from having to specify the java instrumentation might as well keep it as simple as there is the if it is set to then the java instrumentation agent is able to redefine the classes that the agent itself this is a pretty odd and certainly arise got that was using to print the class is when it is loaded first bottom line is if there is exception in transform will be eaten

you use the declaration and you the then copy is used when the property is your you are only accessing the value which just gives you a pointer to the sublayers a to the adc documentation on this the runtime is smart enough to know if the object being set is if an immutable object is being passed in to the property it is retained and not some if you are passing in a mutable object that you want to be able to then you should write your own setter that calls on the this is shown in the that i	
you use the foreach you are modifying the underlying thereby interupting the enumerator so to if you want to use the foreach try the li in if the call to in this example assumes linq to object and depending on the you may be required to also call the prior to calling the main point that i am trying to get across here is that by creating an the foreach is now iterating over the enumerator instead of the allowing you to modify the collection at

you want curved you can use which are mathematically defined curves specified by two vector you plop down the and then solve for a nice curve between a search should reveal source code or math that you can derive into source the nice thing about this is that you can solve for the heading of your vehicle as well as get the next location on your path by doing a percentage the difficult thing is that you have to do a curve length calculation if you want the same number of steps between each set of alternate approach is to use a hidden bitmap with the path drawn on it as a single pixel wide you can find the next location in the path by matching the pixels surrounding your current location to a and then updating the vector with a delta function at each we used this approach for a path traveling prototype where a was being along various paths using a and it works okay until you have some intersections that confuse your vector but if a unidirectional closed this would work just and dead simple to you can smooth out the heading angle of your vehicle by averaging the last few each pixel becomes one so your velocity control is the former you can have specially tagged endpoints for locations or points of in the just use a different color pixel on the path for special in either what you display will probably not be the underlying path but some prettied up representation of your pick whatever is and write a function that steps to the next path location and updates your vehicle heading whenever the car is in if really you can do some radius based collision handling so that cars will automatically stop when a car in front of them on the track has

you want to pad the you the data to be that could be another source of i suggest using test data of a complete number of blocks to eliminate this i suspect the key for the openssl api requires a not an ascii representation of the key as you have in your the paucity of the openssl ruby docs and if you speak a little you may want to prototype in jruby with the bouncycastle provider this is something that done to good effect when working with twofish present in openssl i your comment about padding the you have some confusion in your and not sure how this applies in any case since your posted key is 89 characters in perhaps you should try with a 128 bit to eliminate this padding mysql devs should be spanked for weak there are better ways to stretch passwords than by simply padding with zero bytes
