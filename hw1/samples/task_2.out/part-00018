a cluster can also refer to a specific physical ordering of consider a database with two invoices and if many are inserted chances are that items of the same invoice end up on multiple physical blocks of the underlying when reading such an unneeded data will be read together with the interesting clustering over the foreign key to invoices groups rows of items the same invoice together in the same thus reducing the amount of necessary read operations when accessing the about on a is a number of servers configured to provide the same but look like one server to the can be done for performance reasons servers can answer more requests than a single or redundancy one server the others still configurations often need special software or setup to some like serving static web can be clustered very like need complicated replication schemes to about on a cluster is a of items so that objects from the same cluster are more similar to each other than objects from different about on

a good idea to have some sort of central because allow for you to share but also have a branch somewhere that you can directly generate your your snapshots that server will probably have more than one one of which is thought of as a any previous releases will have their own and depending on the hierarchy of your team if you are divided into groups with each group working on one aspect of the then there may be team or feature based though if you work that way not because it is distributed each developer will also have their own local to make things nice and or they can each have multiple for instance a developer who likes to work while commuting may have a repository on his and another one on his with branches on his laptop that are from the ones on his up to i guess that the part makes this kind of thing a lot because you can commit and even branch while you are away from the transitioning from a then you can just slip straight into the same model as because a dvcs is flexible enough to work in the same you can just start with a single central repository with a few and it is always trivially easy to create more repositories and branches last thing is that you still need the fact that various developers each have copies of the same thing adds but it is not dvcs i use regularly is i have also tried

agree except in two ssl using jsse is noticeably there are native versions that can be plugged but that tends to be more in general the ssl is a bit less straightforward than the apache httpd with an httpd server gives more flexibility re virtual web hosts tomcat is not as flexible in this unsurprisingly it lacks all the options in apache an obvious nice one is built in compression of static files is very easy to add in not hard in tomcat but more are apache httpd server is a totally different beast and has no code shared with neither is an than yeah use tomcat by

all values are passed as strings to your whether you eventually convert them or all should be seen as potentially and not just for this if you put characters in a number you can get a parsing if you put a zero in where it you can get a divide by zero if you put a much larger value in than is or a negative when not or any number of other you can get an error of some and it is quite possible for system errors to leak more information than you for in an if custom errors turned then database connection physical path information or information on third part libraries that your site uses can be leaked in the default error are probably more likely to be problems than other but all user input should be treated as potentially	
allow for rounding errors when comparing floating point rather than testing for something like this is usually what you epsilon is some suitably small like are several reasons why floating point math not all values can be represented exactly for can not be represented in binary floating point in the same way that be represented in is that floating point only uses a fixed number of significant digits relative to the decimal hence the so on large small fractions effectively get truncated never assume that floating point computations return an accurate

am working on a form in that is used for displaying but i still need to allow some manipulation of the what i really want to do is remove the border from a this would allow me to display the information while also allowing the user to select other items in the set without having to display them be more specific i have a list of 4 or 5 email but i only want to display one at a time while allowing the user a way to easily select a different i have searched all over but find an easy way to modify the border of a and a border less combobox will fit my needs just started with so still maybe i am missing seems like this should be a lot easier than turning out to hopefully somebody can help me form is using labels to display so having a combobox in the middle of it makes it look basically what looking for is a link that when clicked opens the default email program and fills in the but i want the button so an alternate address can be i want to display a huge list of addresses if i have i just want to display one at a like a but with no could probably just add a button that displays a list of the alternate but why reinvent the wheel if i can just remove the border from a combobox and have exactly what looking the border from a

am writing a program in which two abstract factory patterns are these are two and modefactory switches between and and quotefactory picks out quotes between several different subjects in the user will pick a if the easymode is picked then the user has to guess the quote whereas if the user chooses the hardmode the user is told who said the quote and then has to so the implementation of the quotes will change depending on the mode as well as the quotes far i have created modefactory as an interface and implemented it into easymode and but now i need to somehow integrate another abstract factory pattern into these modes so that the quotes can be if it is helpful i have also created a quote class in which my quotes are anyone help me come up with a basic implementation of these abstract this is the outline of what i have so although i cannot help but feel that i have overcomplicated it to reclarify what i if the user picks the easy mode then they are provided with the start of a quote and the author of that whereas if they pick the hard mode they are only provided with the start of the for felt the power felt the power hard mode does not give the author to make it harder for the user to guess the rest of the this is not a school been reading head first design patterns and now trying to apply what learned into different situations of their pizza example working on a quote guessing after reading through the qi tv interface modefactory public mode interface quotefactory public quote two abstract factory patterns in

and are used to quickly store and retrieve data are stored in using are calculated by applying a hashing algorithm to a chosen value contained within the this chosen value must be a common value to all the can have multiple records which are be organized in a particular world founded in 1803 and lacking any computer technology had a total of 300 filing cabinets to keep the detailed information for their approximately each file folder were clearly identified with its unique number from 0 to filing clerks of that time had to quickly fetch and store client records for the working the staff had decided that it would be more efficient to use a hashing methodology to store and retrieve their file a client filing clerks would use the unique client number written on the using this client they would modulate it by 300 in order to identify the filing cabinet it is contained when they opened the filing cabinet they would discover that it contained many folders ordered by client after identifying the correct they would simply slip it retrieve a client filing clerks would be given a client number on a slip of using this unique client they would modulate it by 300 in order to determine which filing cabinet had the clients when they opened the filing cabinet they would discover that it contained many folders ordered by client searching through the records they would quickly find the client folder and retrieve our our are and our are important thing to remember is that computers their deal with numbers better than with so accessing a large array using an index is significantly much faster than accessing simon has which i believe to be is that the hashing part is to transform a large space arbitrary usually and mapping it to a small space known usually for this if very important to in the example the possible clients or so are mapped to a smaller main idea in this is to divide your entire data set into segments as to speed up the actual searching which is usually time in our example above each filing cabinet would contain about 300 searching the through 300 records is much faster than having to deal with may have noticed that some actually already do but instead of devising a hashing methodology to generate a hash they will in most cases simply use the first letter of the last so if you have 26 filing cabinets each containing a letter from a to you in theory have just segmented your data and enhanced the filing and retrieval this	
and certainly in early iterations of your catch the more often than the recovery from an exception will require a business rule of some more often than those business rules are not defined for if you the exception instead of letting the application die then you will most likely be inventing business rules for your not general pattern of catching every exception just for the sake of catching it has caused me more headaches than i can it usually happens that someone puts some sort of generic exception handling code throughout the which inevitably ends up hiding a bug or creating some behavior that is catching and then not rethrowing is even suggest that you ask should i catch an

anton if you put the extension methods directly on it would probably nothing particularly but the idea would be that you have a class that you create instances instead you just have purely static building static class public static return x public static return x public static this return returns equivalent of two functions and play the role of your and presumably have similar ones for primitive comparisons and so and then operators like would let you plug two expressions then you lose the ability to use operator which you could have used with your wrapper and instead you have to use method been playing around with the same kind of and the thing i always come back to is that i want to be able to define extension the team apparently considered these for with extension but they were lower priority because they play a part in the overall aims of

brian above said for subversion would also let you do commit hooks that could do substitution for of this i think the problem in the svn world is that you really modify the what the svn book hook scripts can do almost there is one dimension in which hook script authors should show do not modify a commit transaction using hook while it might be tempting to use hook scripts to automatically correct errors or shortcomings or policy violations present in the files being doing so can cause subversion keeps caches of certain bits of repository and if you change a commit transaction in this those caches become indetectably this inconsistency can lead to surprising and unexpected instead of modifying the you should simply validate the transaction in the hook and reject the commit if it does not meet the desired as a your users will learn the value of work there any reason you do this during the build process with ant or

can think of a few different ways to do some of which use jquery depending on what you are trying to custom css and have your view choose which css file to use based on the selection from the this would be view code that constructs a css link based on the value of the database apply classes to your controls from the theme theme would have the same just different settings for each want the user to be able to actually change a particular look and not merely choose a in this case there are a couple of different options one have a helper that generates custom css for the user based on the database values again using common classes so that you can style the controls with call this helper from your view and inject the correct css into the page either directly or as a link to an action that generates the css in response to a and i like this set the style property on the control itself using the view layout and get the value of the background color property from new id want to have the color change dynamically based on a user action and have the new come from the in this case you can inject the color into the script tag where your jquery lives see any need to use a hidden

data size will probably be larger than you current tree since xml is text and therefore all data has to be serialized to a textual so loading may or may not be which also depends on your current load for the querying and modifying data is very simple and fairly efficient if done but due to the textual nature it usually cannot exceed a well done binary you need transformation of your tree data displaying xml is great using allow you to create pretty much any html or text representation of your data with little programming therefore also testing and	
database design for this is simple as you as far as it taking longer once the user has more what you can do is just paginate the show the first or whatever makes sense and only pull those generally your times increase very much unless the volume of messages increases by an order of magnatude or you should be able to pull back 1000 short messages in way less than a now it may take more time for the page to display at that but thats where the pagination should would suggest though going through and thinking of future features and building your database out a little more based on adding more features to the software is changing the database is comparatively

decide where you want to put your programming for better to use some other tree view control use table and javascript framework to handle click i recommend using plain old ashx handler files for ajax they have less overhead than aspx and calling page ajax calls and results must contain only json or xml formatted not the oher rad tool like vs and treeview control offers quick production of web but of course with some you need to go back to server to handle every which draws issues with whole page life cycle processing and huge amount of data transfer for ajax calls along with html are transferred from server to client for every ajax if you want to stick with i css friendly control they greatly reduce size of generated html my from 100kb to 20kb of and replace table layout with wrap treeview inside ajax but just and use conditional updates of be afraid to use several keep viewstate

deserializing a fair amount of data through for each when i output how long the deserialization it varies it is not unusably slow at the but it would be nice to make it the data represents the same maps and vectors but merely with different at the memory spiking as each deserialization takes i have to believe a better way of doing this than continually allocating and deallocating all this a few of the read times as an 390 422 422 422 438 2156 1797 1656 1328 1219 1078 1078 there a way of writing a custom deserialization function for the same data that uses so i can specify to allocate the memory at the and then just change their values for each i realised a minor issue with the optimization flags i was using was causing the serialization data to be written which resulted in the inconsistency of deserialization after fixing it is now consistently at 750 780 milliseconds each my original question still as currently i am serializing and deserializing an entire stl when i really want to only serialize the contents the size and indexing of the container will remain exactly the not sure of the best way to go about doing this deserialization

easy to make a big deal out of to my mind it is a pretty and useful it quantifies on you will learn from an like flipping a taking a branch or indexing an a comparison operation in the middle of a search algorithm has a certain probability p of taking one and of taking the p is as it is in a binary then if you take that you know 1 bit more than you did because base is on the other if you take the other branch you also learn 1 get the average amount of information you will multiply what you learn on the first branch times the probability you take that plus what you learn on the second branch times the probability of that times 1 plus times 1 is bit plus or total 1 bit of what you can expect to learn on average from that the other suppose you are doing linear search in a table of 1024 the first the probability of yes is so the entropy of yes at that decision times 10 about if the answer is you learn 10 but the chance of that is about 1 in a the other no is much more entropy roughly 1 times roughly zero about the two and on average you will learn about of a bit on that why linear search is the entropy much you can expect to at each decision is too since going to have to learn 10 bits to find the entry in the

find a clear answer to this question with all my i want a web is there a library in java that takes advantage of the hardware accelerated graphics drivers on the as in opengl and picturing writing some driver detection code before the applet launches to detect 3d graphics realize there are a lot of java 3d libraries but figure this was under the impression that you could do but find how about flash and i thought all their 3d graphics are software see the answer to the question is java does have 3d hardware thanks for all the guess my real question is getting to what extent is this supported for full can you use directx or opengl for i might expect some features to be missing as that tend to abstract things could i make a gpuid program or a utility that the gpu capabilities in is it could i port an old 3d game like quake to a java applet and have decent on client system of applets with hardware accelerated 3d opengl

from a project management theory scheduling i know the exact there the task is about sorting jobs is a arc is a job order we have some connected oriented graph without there is an arc from vertex to vertex if and only if hates assume there is a source incoming and destination outgoing if that is not the just add imaginary now we want to find length of a longest path from source to destination will be number of rows but mind the imaginary will define vertex rank as number of arcs in a longest path between source and this vertex obviously we want to know algorithm for finding 0 for all verteces 1 for all arcs for all arcs j no changes on this each step at least one vertex increases its therefore in this form complexity is the this algorithm also gives you student distribution among just group students by their respective another code with the same possibly it is better v is a list of vertex let it be something like v source has index destination has index e is a list of tuples of the form end changes for e in if changes the answer is derived from value of course this is the simplest it can be and time estimate can be obvious optimization update only verteces adjacent to those that were updated on the previous introduce a queue with verteces whose rank was also for edge storing one should use adjacency with such optimization complexity would be each vertex may appear in the queue at most but vertex rank never exceeds number of therefore total number of algorithm steps will not exceed

got a list view in my mvc app that shows a check box next to each for each item in new with you can tell from the submitting the form each time a user clicks a check in the my post action looks like as byval as as for i 0 to if to update a database end return i get an array of selected values and after each checkbox i assumed they would but finding the two arrays to be out of sync for some also a lot of overkill to process the whole list every time a checkbox is so like to revisit this whole the best way to set this up so that clicking a checkbox will update a specific database can it be done without reloading the list each the best way to respond to checkbox clicks on an mvc list

got to develop an auto scaling arrivals and departures board at started out easily enough with me creating a table with percentage based column widths the overall table being got a small piece of jquery letting me change the scale of my text but its only to prove the really after being able to automatically scale the font and table cell sizes according to the available screen width and i do know the maximum string length allowed for each column cell so i automatically set the size based on some a bit stuck as where to actively developing this now but my initial thoughts calculate maxstringwidth by having a lookup table and the font metrics for a character 1em in size on the cells are all assigned screen percentages so i should be able to read those i can set the font this sound a feasible it also raises questions about the padding above and below each string in each cell but sure i can do someting similar there qualify where there examples of this kind out in the wild my approach you done it can share i shot myself in the and should consider have mentioned using flash to the pm as a means of autoscaling the text as we can then do a lot of the font metrics in only just starting out with that using the flash ide so be limited to that as a development for any examples and departure board using css and

had the same issue and it was absolutely what the docs say on the mysql website the driver try to stale dead enabled the driver will throw an exception for a queries issued on a stale or dead which belong to the current but will attempt reconnect before the next query issued on the connection in a new the use of this feature is not because it has side effects related to session state and data consistency when applications do not handle sqlexceptions and is only designed to be used when you are unable to configure your application to handle sqlexceptions resulting from dead and stale connections investigate setting the mysql server variable to some high value rather than the default of 8 my it seem like the on the next functionality worked but i was using mysql which may have been the reason for ended up writing a that catches the checks for that specific and attempts to reconnect and retry the query if provides a bit more and indicates that autoreconnect will probably be removed in the future

have a requirement for porting some existing c code to a compliant have some options of splitting the code into discrete function blocks and weaving those blocks into a standard solution structured text but this would require carving up the c code in order to build each function looking at the iec spec i realsied that the instruction form could be a target language for a the wikepedia article lists two development these seem to be targeted compiling iec languages to not c to possible solution is to push the c code through a c to pascal translator and use that as a starting point for a not any of these i will go down the route of splitting the code up into function prompted by reply i should have mentioned that the c code is an existing control so the programs algorithms should already suit a plc to iec il

honestly surprised at those a computationally intensive product i would place a large wager on c to perform you might write code that leaks memory like a and has interesting threading related but it should be only reason i could think that java or would be faster is due to a short run length on the if little or no gc avoid the overhead of actually deallocating if the process is iterative or try sticking a wherever you think done a bunch of setting things to null or otherwise removing if dealing with terabytes of my opinion is going to be much better off with deterministic memory allocation that you get with if you deallocate roughly close to when you allocate your heap will stay largely with a gc environment you may very well end up with your program using far more memory after a decent run length than you would just because of me this sounds like the sort of project where c would be the appropriate but would require a bit of extra attention to memory my bet is that or java will fail if run on a full data

i expect that any pointer in user space programs lies in a safe distance from the addresses 0 and so that i can safely add a small offset to the pointer without checking for an what is the largest positive n for which i can safely assume that p n overflow when p is a char pointer into a constant character buffer or a dynamically allocated string a modern operating avoid talking about not about bounds for if you have a pointer p to the beginning of a string with m chars and you want to access the char at the positive offset then you either need to check that i m or you can check indirectly p i p in the latter case you also have to make sure that p i you have to make sure that p i p i is not valid standard c if i regardless of whether p i is actually dereferenced or whether it the question really interested in is whether there is a small n for which p n overflow answering this question obviously requires some knowledge about how modern operating systems organize the address it would already be very interesting to hear about any one particular even if not preferably not some obscure embedded x86 or linux and mac would be most is smallest offset for which i can safely omit overflow checking when i add it to a

i first posted this question i had strong coupling between my web service and application controller where the controller needed to open multiple threads to the service and as it received back data it had to do a lot of processing on the returned data and merge it into one i did not like the fact that the client had to so much processing and merge the returned data before it was ready to be used and wanted to move that layer to the service and let the service open the asynchronous threads to the suppliers and merge the results before returning them to the challenge i had was that i could not wait till all threads were complete and results were i had to start receiving data as it was that called me to implement an observer pattern on the service so that it would notify my application when new set of results are merged and ready to be used and send them to the was looking for how to do this using either on asmx webservices or wcf and so far i have found implementing it using wcf but this thread is always open for suggestions and observer pattern using

i personally would do is to make a script in some scripting language to separate the different data sets before the file is read into and possibly do some of the necessary data you want to do the splitting in look up and is too and is meant for reading a single data you could write the different data sets into different or if you are cook up r objects that are usable with and read from the correct parts of the underlying big you have dealt with separating the data sets into different use on those whichever variant is best if those are not tabs but see if indicates in your be sure to specify it as part of if you do r thinks you have data in that but with the right you automatically get the field converted into it seems that one of your fields can include time stamps like so you need to use and specify a class to which your time stamp format can be if the class just define your own class and an function that does the

i recently wrote a review of using several major ides with eclipse and visual studio and ironpython not a big fan of ironpython studio not really production quality in my the designers target ironpython 1 and the generated code require changes to run them on their own with having to modify generated code is never use the designers with visual studio to generate and then subclass in ironpython to actually implement the working with ironpython any of the python ides will be i like wing because the autocomplete is the best seen in a python you can also teach it to do autocomplete for libraries generating pi working with wing personal is free but the professional version is set your interpreter in the project settings to be though because you lose the interactive shell inside wing which is very useful for trying things means that you need external tools to run your launch your but using the wing scripting api or the os tools to integrate these tools into wing is emacs are all editors ides with python integration and will all work very well which you prefer depends on your tastes and you have any other requirements for an general ironpython development i use msbuild to provide build wix for building pyc compiler to compile to binary and a custom executable for the project that is very thin wrapper around the ironpython hosting api written in an editor ide is only one of the tools used and a general python ide should serve you i recently wrote a review of using several major ides with ironpython

i see what having essentially duplicate c and functions buys suggest keeping the c functions as basic as defining an api with all the primitives exposed and nothing then define the classes at a much higher so a uart would have a meaningful that sort of it would have all necessary data the classes would not expose all possible in order to do something write a new member function or class or calling the c the approach in systems like occi oracle call and mfc and and it works	
i should have mentioned not interested in using the thank you for those suggestions but the code as it i was hoping to wrote a function to search a datatable for terms in an i then return the datatable as a dataset so it can be bound to a does anyone have any optimization since this is a search term typed instantly like to make the function as fast as the speed is actually pretty good already but i figured be worth asking you all if there was anything else i could change about public function as byref residenttbl as as dim newdts as new dim temptable as new dim termsceiling as residentpassceiling termsceiling newtable for j 0 to if j 1 begin first pass for i 0 to if have an excact match on account skip further return if like or like or like or like or like or like or like or like add to the end end next end first pass begin searches we want to search the already filtered datatable from each temptable temptable temppassceiling for i 0 to if have an excact match on account skip further return if like or like or like or like or like or like or like add to the end end next temptable end end next residenttbl return newdts end datatable

i think the answer is going to be the development expertise and the project needs that will decide web forms is so heavily used that it likely going away anytime there are so many custom controls and support such as components and the main benefit of web forms is how easy it is to get a dynamic website up and it really is a rad way of developing once that team has more experience with creating larger websites with much higher demands in terms of and then they will look towards other solutions for in this they will realize that web forms are harder for they may also see that viewstates reduce performance and look for possible mvc has the stated it is unlikely that anyone will convert their sites to use this new framework right away or it requires the team to learn the new and work out the new the team will have to learn new ways to do the exact same for how easy is it to support uploading a file using i saw there a reason you create a site using mvc and web forms so you may see more hybrids in the near but i doubt that web forms will ever go kind of think about web forms like the way vb1 changed the way windows applications are created on the to this the rad way of creating application still exists and will never go

i was doing something like cross platform cross language i would create a since the languages are similar in syntax you could make a translator easy then instead of calling java or apis directly from the you would call your which would re implement the java and apis you would in this way you could create a cross language sandbox if you since the main differences in java and are object i would get those by reflecting the and then reconstruct the then it would be easy to have an interpreter run through and implement the function bodies and convert properties to getters setters already knowing the structure of the this of course is assuming some of the features in and become very difficult to would be but probably not as complex as reconstructing a core in java by and having to have 2 teams working on them if this idea sparks some inspiration i might create i would really rather see a simpler stable mono installation for i think a code level interpreter based on a set of common api classes is something very possible to write with a team in a week or

idea is that you create a unique number for the and when the form is posted you save this unique number in the database in the record that you are before saving you check if that number has already been in that case a form that has been reposted by you are updating a you only have to check if that record has been saved with the same unique but if you are adding a new record you have to check if any other record has that guid is a good number to use as very unlikely that you get a a 31 bit random number that the class can produce is also pretty unlikely to give but the 128 bits of a guid makes it a lot more have to create the guid value in the just use in the code that initialises the you can put the guid in a hidden field in the in the database you only need a field that can store a guid either a guid data type if available or just a text field large enough to hold the text representation of the can use the method to get the string representation of a guid value that you can put it in the using gives the most compact 32 hexadecimal digits without using gives the more recognisable format to get the guid back from a string you just use

if you know for certain that this means either investigated this issue before on your particular compiler or already done the functional that design to eliminate algorithms that minimize calls into done all of these things then often the best thing to do is get your compiler to emit something lower level that you can examine yourself and make specific judgments based on in my experience every compiler is a little sometimes an optimization on one causes another to produce larger less efficient you already done these things then call it premature optimization and recommend against optimizing before doing these things gives rewards which are disproportionately small when compared to the cost

is as you may want to allocate a larger buffer then or you may be calling it in a cons lists as type offs snprintf if offs max return max count empty for cons cons cons cons if count 15 offs snprintf buf max if cons ref offs snprintf buf max if offs max return max offs buf max cons if offs max return max if offs max return max offs snprintf buf max return max you keep going without all the you get a buffer overflow and it will happen with so less common to check the you need to change your behaviour based on whether a function you check the many standard library functions either can or will cause undefined behaviour so you need to check those you need to change the behaviour based on the return then no point checking

is basically programmatic access to the virtual memory sub you 1g and you mmap you get a pointer to file as if it were in at this stage nothing has happened save the actual mapping operation of reserving pages for the file in the large the the longer the mapping of order to start reading data from the you simply access it through the pointer you were returned in the mmap you wish to parts of the just visit the area like to make sure you visit all of the pages you want to since the vm will only load the pages you for say within your 1g you have a 10mb area that like to map the simplest way would be to just your or whatever data structure you letting the vm page in data as if you that the of the and that your page size for your vm then you can just cast the mmap pointer to a char and just iterate through the load 10mb of data from int offset offset offset 10 1024 offset 4 char mmapptr deref pointer to force mmap char c for l1 and l2 mmap has nothing to do with all about how you access the using the underlying vm anything that addresses data within the block will work from you change any of the the vm will automatically flush out old pages as new pages are needed if you actually do change then the vm will write those pages back for

is no clear answer whether sql portability is desirable or not it really depends a lot on the such as the type of the application is going to be a service ie there will only ever be you hosting then obviously nobody but you will care whether your sql is portable so you could safely ignore it as long as you have no specific plans to drop support for your current the application is going to be installed at a number of which each have their own established database obviously sql portability is very important to it lets you widen your potential and may give a bit of piece of mind to clients who are on the fence in regards to their database whether you want to support or you are happy selling only for oracle or only to for is up to you and what you think your market you are coding in then the vast majority of your potential customers are probably going to expect if then not a big deal to assume or similarly if you are in then you could assume microsoft sql there is a flip side because there may exist a small but less competitive market of php or users who want to connect to other database systems than the i would largely regard this as a market research unless as in my first example you are providing a hosted service where it matter to in which case it is for your own convenience

is not spammer if someone looks at the code for your site and determines the pattern that you are using for your email then specific code can be written to try and decipher know that i would say it is but it prevents which is quite a big with you simply get that what if you want to copy a relatively complex email address to your address book in you have to resort to typing it out which is prone to the responsibility to the users spam filters is really a poor while i believe that users should be diligent in guarding against that absolve the person publishing the address from that trying to do this in an absolutely secure manner is nearly the only way to do that is to have a shared secret which the code uses to decipher the encoded email the problem with this is that because the javascript is interpreted on the client there anything that you can keep a secret from for email addresses nowadays generally work because most email bot harvesters going to concern themselves with coding specifically for every they are going to try and have a minimal algorithm which will get maximum results payoff worth it because of simple encoders will defeat most but if someone really wants to get at the emails on your then they can and probably easily as since the code that writes the addresses is publically all this into it makes sense that facebook went the image because they can alter the image to make ocr all but they can virtually guarantee that email addresses be given that they are probably one of the largest email address repositories in the it could be argued that they carry a heavier burden than any of and while are forced down that route to ensure security and privacy for their vast user

is useful to consider the front end and the mysql backend separate mysql should not have to worry about display nor should php assume that the backend does any sort of preprocessing on the advice would be to store the data in plain characters using utf8 and escape any dangerous characters with mysqls then reads the utf8 encoded data from processes them most and displays it via whichever template you choose to correctly suggested set names should be the first thing you call after making a mysql this makes the mysql treat all input and output as that if you have to use or you are not setting the html character encoding it is easiest to require that every component of your system uses since that way you should never have to do manual which can cause hard to track issues later

just moved some code from one platform to another which required a change in compiler two of the utility sources caused linking problems with undefined for this example call them and was compiling and linking fine with and i figured the switch to would be a no when using the compilation went fine but the linking failed due to undefined the symbols for every function in foo that were used in other source were undefined even though was included in problem was that the file did not include the so the question how did link this code when could i figure that was expecting a file and was then including it so as to avoid this but does anyone have a better someone explain this linker difference between and

key with migration is to do several do not do anything without a current if the keys will be you need to store both the old and new in the new structure at least temporarily if the key field is exposed to the users because they may be searching by it to get old you need to have a thorough understanding of the relationships to child if you change the key field all related tables must change as this is where having both old and new key stored comes in if you forget to change any of the data will no longer be correct and will be so this is a critical out some test cases of particularly complex data making sure to include one or more test cases for each related store the existing values in work start the migration you insert into the new table using a select from the old depending on the amount of you may want to loop through batches one record at a to improve if the new key is an you simply put the value of the old key in its field and let the database create the new do the same with the related then use the old key value in the table to update the foreign key fields with something fkfield table2 table1 t1 on your migration by running the test cases and comparing the data with what you stored from before the it is utterly critical to thoroughly test migration data or you be sure the data is consistent with the old migration is a very complex it pays to take your time and do it very methodically and	
kind of are we talking if you only have you probably need to your code into packages just for the sake of your project the first distinction you want to make is to separate code from the underlying datamodel and the having a cleanly separated layers is crucial in order to be able to do proper unit having trouble in getting rid of the circular it is probably the case the the classes are actually and should reside in the same the abstraction layers right is probably one of the most important aspects when designing the overall

know if there are two and i know if pure mixed oo uses virtual table dispatch each instance carries a table of functions case of it carries a pointer to the but that play any role in the dispatch and when you call the compiler knows its the second method of an so it emits code to jump to the second pointer in the virtual method dynamic languages usually solved by having a dictionary of methods on the name is looked up and whatever function is is are mixed approaches in you look up the interface by then you execute a method from its code like some switch statement switch depending on the type of an is generated to speed up the second	
know if there is this modules implemented yet but what i can load balance is what i can argue random placing of jobs is best bet unless you know far more information how load will come in future and in most of cases you really what you the client connects all nodes are examined to see which has the least load and then the ip of the loaded server is forwarded back to the you know that all those least loaded node will not be highest loaded just in next how you know that all those high loaded nodes which you will not include in list will not drop load just in next you really know it unless you have very rare measure your performance and set probability be chosen depend of choose node randomly regardless of current use this as initial when you set it then you can try make up some more sophisticated i bet that it will be very hard work to beat this initial trust very to be more clear in one subtle i strongly argue that you predict future load from current and historical load but you should use knowledge about tasks durations probability and current decomposition of this work is so hard to try

looking for a good parser generator that i can use to read a custom format in our large commercial currently this particular file format is read with a handmade recursive parser but the format has grown and complexified to the point where that approach has become seems like the ultimate solution would be to build a proper grammar for this format and then use a real parser generator like yacc to read but having trouble deciding which such generator to use or even if worth the trouble at looked at antlr and but our project has specific constraints beyond that make me wonder if as appropriate for in i parser that generates c or code with antlr 3 support it claims to generate straight c but the docs on getting it to actually work are sort of constrained memory memory is at a huge premium in our app and even tiny leaks are i need to be able to override the memory allocator to use our custom or at the very least i need to give it a contiguous pool from which it draws all its memory which i can deallocate en bloc i can spare about 200kb for the parser executable but whatever dynamic heap it allocates in parsing has to get freed this is less critical but we ought to be able to parse 100kb of text in no more than a second on a 3ghz be we use gnu like ide and debugging but it looks like getting its c target to actually work with our app will be a huge before i embark on that is antlr the right tool for this text format in question looks something real foo bar model animation references attribute fluxcapacitance 10 asset the antlr parser generator best for a app with constrained

me try to clarify those terms to in context of esb architecture should not be considered as simple queue for message to allow integration of different esb provides much important additional functionalities of messages can be routed to different depending on message content or endpoint between different protocol esb should be able to seamlessly integrate applications use different transport protocols pure messages can be enriched with missing data before further and functionalites are provided by services that operate within services connect to each other via unique messages dispatched between endpoints are using unified that encapsulates application that natively use different need to connect to esb via suitable adapter service that will provide necessary transport this way applications that use esb are decoupled from each other and need to provide conversions those are only very brief descriptions of enterprise service bus is only for specific kind of architecture but it is not standardized in any so specific implementations can be very different from each you are interested in standardized you can take a look at jbi bussiness there are several implementations of jbi among them very good introduction to esb technologies is presented in source esbs in book published by

not that is that vast libraries and frameworks exist that can help you do your this is true for many programming look at cpan for for what language to use depends in great part on what your goals can start simple and work your way up to larger and larger is by no means too complex for a but learning any form of web programming is a lot to learn when all if you were looking at for the same there is a lot there you are doing ignore all of j2ee except for jsp and jms and a very few other the share of j2ee is only useful in the context of an enterprise application that needs to and in fact can be harmful when used in smaller frameworks such as web and so on help you do your but are yet more things to learn to do your there is a lot to you use quite a lot of development is done with lamp linux mysql with you need to worry about java or or any of those works very well for a wide class of and on the server are more appropriate for larger but once you are familiar with they work just fine for smaller services as have to decide what your exact goals then look at how people have implemented the kind of thing that looking at this will help you figure out what technologies are the most necessary for the niches looking at going

of if you literally are only doing every then i worry terribly about the performance in this these matches are pretty and i think going to have a performance problem by iterating through your patterns array and calling separately like in if can indeed combine all the patterns into one using the operator like some people are but just slap them together with a this will break badly if any of your patterns the or would recommend at least grouping your patterns using parenthesis in not really sure if this ends up being has to loop through whether the or if i had to guess guess that individual matches would be close to as fast and easier to read and if performance is what looking for i think the most important thing to do is pull out the non regex matches into a simple i would imagine that some of your checks must be simple string checks like looking to see if site is is on the doing in if in if avoiding as many as possible is probably going to be your best is a faster than

of the answers so far are and get at different aspects of how a hashtable here is a simple example that might be lets say we want to store some items with lower case alphabetic strings as a simon the hash function is used to map from a large space to a small a naive implementation of a hash function for our example could take the first letter of the and map it to an so has a hash code of has a hash code of would be we have an array of 26 buckets be arraylists in and we put the item in the bucket that matches the hash code of our if we have more than one item that has a key that begins with the same they will have the same hash so would all go in the bucket for that hash code so a linear search would have to be made in the bucket to find a particular our if we just had a few dozen items with keys spanning the it would work very if we had a million items or all the keys all started with or then our hash table would not be to get better we would need a different hash function more

order to ensure that the list it would have to keep a list of numbers previously as it has to therefore generate the entire list by the end of the this is equivalent in storage requirement to generating the ordered list and then about shuffling if the range of the random numbers is very large but the quantity of numbers required is small hinted that this is the actual requirement in a then generate a complete list and shuffling it is a shuffle on a huge array involves accessing pages of virtual memory in a way that will defeat the paging system a smaller scale the same problem would occur with the memory this searching the will be much more so the ideal would be to use heuristics by to pick the right implementation for the given for giving examples in rather than but training myself to think in int a new if for n n used new for n n int r while r return cost of doing the checking for repeated the looping while there are will be but there will likely be some value where it becomes faster than allocating for the entire sufficiently small quantity it may be faster to use an array for and do linear searches in due to the greater lower the cheapness of the for large quantities and large it might be preferable to return an object that produces the numbers in the sequence on instead of allocating the array for the results this is very easy to implement in thanks to the int for n n int r while r yield return

our replication scheme we replicate a number of including a table that contains binary image all other tables replicate as but the photos table does i suspect this is because of the larger amount of data in the photos table or perhaps because the image data is a using smaller fields did not is some config image could be anywhere from revision and approved copy is stored along with so a single row may approach once had trouble with the text repl configuration but i have set that to the max value using and with are filtered based on a but so are other working databases are using the same local db server the development and are configured for transactional replicated database uses a i noticed that sometimes regenerating the snapshot and reinitializing the subscription caused the images to taking this into i configured the snapshot agent to regenerate the snapshot every minute or so for debugging purposes this is overkill for a production this did not help is causing the table not to replicate while all others do not have a is there a way around if how would i go about debugging have used sql server profiler to look for errors as well as the replication no errors the operation just fails silently as far as i can am using sql server 2005 with service pack 3 on windows server 2003 service pack have found out the hard way that is absolutely right in his answer videos and other binary files should not be stored in the iis handles these files more efficiently than i server

php templating systems the proper way is to parse the template state machine or at least generate php code from and then use that php code then be able to use normal for conditional expressions good idea for implementing it will be pita to handle nesting and enforce proper syntax beyond basic performance will be very poor have to be careful not to create backtracking expression and even then end up scanning and copying kbs of templates several

planning on running a ruby process that may take a month to if like to ensure that a blackout or hitting the wrong button cost me the whole there an easy way to periodically save the state to that involve more effort would include adding code that marshals everything apart from the or possibly using a virtual machine for the operating those the process involves parsing a xml file of a processing some and saving the information to an activerecord database as it goes the project is and the xml file is nothing i just want to be in the first pass gets a list of wikipedia page the next pass determines the first link from each page to another and then i calculate some from where i left as suggested by some is probably a valid if it crashes during the first then i probably could telling it not to add entries that already if it crashes during the second then i should only ask it to build links for pages that already had their link if it crashes during calculating the i could just the more general version of this question asked at a memory for later it looks like you easily back up backing up a ruby

question is a bit inserting data validating make you want to know how to insert well a basic mysql question which is probably best answered by consulting the you want to know how to validate the going to have to specify the kind of validation you sanders has sort of like asking do i make a there are infinite ways you can do the question is too you just want to check to see if the value submitted is a valid a quick and dirty way of doing it is just to insert it into the table you have a column of the then make a query to retrieve the value if the stored value is that data value or then the submitted value was not a valid your code would look something into values from where submitted date was there are many drawbacks to the above you probably want to validate the data you insert and if you are updating a record rather than inserting a new then you will need to fetch the original value before it is overwritten with an invalid i think you meant to say or a menu is something

question is have the installed files benefits of msi repair is that if something gets mucked a virus infects your or some silly user deletes the wrong entries then the windows isntaller resiliency check kicks in and repairs all your are a number situations where the windows installer resiliency check will kick suggest changing the behaviour of your application so that you update installed alternatively if you want to conform to and not update your installed files then probably need to use an alternate installer not writing changes to stuff in program files are how does your application handle running under a limited user on a terminal on none of these scenarios will permit writing to the program files folder any protected solution to prevent this behavior from happening would default configuration files to these on first run to update the this prevents configuration being during msi try not setting the zip as a in the particular i think windows installer only checks for that key files i think probably going to run into the limitations of vs2005 setup projects pretty quickly and so it might be worth checking out if got the also one thing that find is that windows installer setup projects are almost always having hundreds or thousands of components seems to be the nature of the

run into this apparently not uncommon problem have a interface in assembly am dynamically loading assembly and trying to cast an object from it into my interface from assembly failing with an come to understand why a class in assembly a and a class in assembly even with the same name and the same are not the same thing and cannot be cast to one question is there a solution to is there any way i can make the two types or do i need to duplicate my interface in assembly b and cast the object to loading assembly b with is there a different way to do that which would make them be the first person to have this what trying to do would seem like a fairly common task with plugin can you cast objects from different assemblies into each

sad truth is that c really designed to encapsulate all those memory management you look at fairly high quality apis like see that the common pattern is that you pass a pointer to a pointer to a which then allocates the and that you later pass it again to a function that destroys not necessarily but i think there are many ways to make it really elegant without simulating oop in

seems that when you use you can override the default setting which is that whitespace is so i guess what happens in this case and why you get any in the second case added so the compiler thinks that you want to specify the scope it seems a bit weird so it may be a sure brian from the team will answer this doubt soon i think the compiler treats your second example just as an easier to compile ar new rnd new can force it to treat it as you wanted if you add parentheses and write something like ar new rnd new you can use parentheses to specify scopes in any place of the for example you can a a a printfn example prints and then of this seem to be very but it is useful when using the keyword that behaves like but works for objects and ensures that the object is disposed when it leaves the scope is just like in some new file new let txt printfn is now completely forgot to mention the important bit the first way of writing the code seems more natural to me it fully uses the benefits of syntax that so i would prefer it

simply create the application context from multiple xml config files based on for testing without a the context is created by using all the config files in each service we access the services via spring and thus the client uses an application context that is initialized via an xml config which defines the proxy beans that enable meanwhile the services are confgured by the same xml files as used by the test but the application context is now loaded by either the dispatcherservlet or an ejb or setup allows us to tailor the application context for each scenario without having to duplicate any information in configuration which keeps maintenance much there is no hard dependency between config files via since that is handled at the layer above that actually creates the comment on the ide support since we are not using it

so often i see a question on so which forces me to spend half an hour editing a really bad wikipedia the article is now only moderately in the part that bears on your i wrote as computer a function or expression is said to have a in addition to producing a it also modifies some state or has an interaction with calling functions or the outside for a function might modify a global or a static modify one of its raise an write data to a display or read call other or launch in the presence of side a behavior depends on past that the order of evaluation because understanding an effectful program requires thinking about all possible side effects often make a program harder to effects are essential to enable a program to interact with the outside world other computers on but the degree to which side effects are used depends on the programming imperative programming is known for promiscuous use of side in functional side effects are rarely functional languages such as standard ml and scheme do not restrict side but it is customary for programmers to avoid the functional language haskell restricts side effects with a static type only a function that produces a result of io type can have side

sounds to me like you are just asking if a path exists between two vertices in an undirected but not necessarily what that path might this is the same as asking if the two vertices are in the same connected component of the you really do only need to know if the two vertices are in the same connected then there is a simple and efficient algorithm using a data the disjoint set structure each for each vertex in if the vertex does not exist in the create a new subset in the dss containing only the merge the subsets of the two determine if a path exists between two vertices after processing all the just check if the two vertices are in the same if they then some path exists between an efficient implementation of the this algorithm achieves just slightly worse than linear and even with a simple implementation of the dss as is time and storage no matter if you are only calculating transitive closure or and using algorithm requires an calculation for each	
sources of advice are correct when they say it is the domain in many it will be quite closely aligned your data model as the domain and data models differ is that the data model is relatively static in form whereas your domain model adds the specific constraints and rules of your for in my data model i represent blood pressure as smallints and in my i have a pressure object that holds values for each of the two readings and that also imposes additional restrictions on the range of acceptable values the range for systolic is much smaller than that for it also adds qualitative judgments on these values bp of is addition of these aspects of the problem domain is what makes the domain model more than just the data in some domains those that would be better rendered with a fully data model and that map poorly on the relational find that the two diverge quite all the systems created feature a very high degree of i often push a fair number of domain constraints into the data model itself via stored	
specific need to be to become was long ago conceived but hardware was too slow to make it of the first objections for java adoption was it was too slow and indeed it was but since better have appeared and hardware is much faster creating a complete oo solution sound crazy programming is not new but every day since processing cost is cheaper a new layer of abstraction can be introduced into the software and create programs that are very specific to the domain where they are most example is ruby on is not only a development but actually a different language is well specific for webdevelopment an interesting article in the the for domain specific by martin

standard or data structure has very good running times for single threaded however what is under i that it is totally valid even without locking or any atomic operations aside from atomic pointer sized anyone see any problems with the following i will assume that pointer sized writes are from not hard to argue that you can safely run the function in several threads as the only updates that will occur are all sets to the same if you allow the function to return the answer that was true when it was called opposed to when it not hard to argue that many and a single can be run at the same the argument for the change and the only updates roots and the never update for the remaining case i think that works as well but not so sure of not requiring that the solution be just as efficient as the single threaded order to avoid also willing to discard globally coherent taking another the cases work because if the side that is not the new root is unioned with something else not as a then you could cut it off of other side of the second union union union 2 aliases union y union b union can be sidestepped with a a the normal algorithm thread safe without any extra

subversion versions prior to merging subdirectories made later merges of the rest of the directory tree really you merged a svn simply applied all the changes made in that directory to the other if you had already merged a subdirectory and then tried to merge the main all the changes in the subdirectory were already in the target branch you merged them svn now know that these changes were from a previous it just saw that there were things the when it tried to merge the resulting in lots of avoid this you would have had to take care to only merge the directories that you merged making the whole process much more you had to remember exactly which revisions of which subdirectories you already had merged and only apply the remaining changes of the remaining this can get always merging the whole branch made this much current versions of subversion keep track of previous merges so that these problems can be subdirectories is no for svn this is just a global revision of the in that revision there will be only changes in one but for svn still a new version of the whole just like any other

team has a number of processes which we run manually but which may run for many the processes do various things to large numbers of entities database obviously from time to time there are failures and we have to design or processes to handle these failures gracefully and move on so the whole job is not brought on the particular process in the severity and urgency of failures in some cases we send emails when a rare but important error in other cases we just log it and move and so problem is that we have different error handling code scattered everywhere and more often than not when we it and move no one ever goes back and reads the so no one ever knows what problems we default to email for all problems because there would simply be too many are long running processes but not daemons where something like snmp or nagios might feel like a good surely this is a fairly common problem but i cannot seem to find many solutions heard people talking about using log4j other similar logging to log to a which seems like it might be a step in the right but surely there are more sophisticated solutions out there by imagining something where your logger writes events to a database and a web interface that lets you see what errors are happening with what processes in real time as well as configure email alerts for specific something like this if what approaches have you used to successfully deal with similar what worth most of our codebase is in python but i would imagine any decent implementations of this idea are largely and obviously any conceptual solutions would be as i just spent some time looking at which is kind of what i am looking but like it to be a webapp instead of a desktop and have alerting i just discovered and which are both somewhat along the lines of what i was though both target rails are the best practices for tracking in long running

the kind of activity looking you need to look at the problem from a new point of that you need to figure out how to decouple the steps so that delays and problems propogate back up the have the right idea in logging hits to a database insofar as that guarantees this is something the database it comes at a one of which is that the database completes the before getting back to thus the recording of the hit is coupled with the invocation of the any delay in recording the hit will slow the offers a way to decouple called in you tell the database this but i stick around while you do and the database says i got your insert it when i have a it is conceivable that this reduces locking issues because it lets one thread in mysql do the not whichever you connect it only works with myisam which is a more general solution to the is to have a logging daemon that accepts your logging information and just it to wherever it has to the trick to making this fast is the this the sort of solution syslogd would

the line segment from the startpoint to the construct a plane orthogonal to this line segment through the midpoint of the line then position the camera somewhere in this plane at an distance of more than the following from the intersection point of plane and line looking at the intersection the up vector of the camera must be in the plane and the horizontal field of view must be 90 camera positions will all have the startpoint and the endpoint on the left or right border of the view port and verticaly solution might be to write a function that takes the the and the desired position of both points on the then just solve the projection equation for the camera

the point of view of having had my work machines unexpectedly powered down last weekend elsewhere in the i sympathise with the there any value in partitioning the could the input file be reworked into many smaller of magnitude i but i have a process that loads about 2 million rows across a few ar models each to get around the appalling database latency issues that i suffer from server in a different country i rewrite my input csv files into 16 each fragment is recorded in the fragment which helps me identify any completion failures for it works surprisingly well and when are usual run time about 30 your xml input is reasonably it should be fairly straightforward to extract sure a better term than into separate i know how fast a sax parser would be able to do this probably not too but it could be done without an xml library at all if it was still too consider adding a column to the target model to identify the fragment that it was loaded from that way stripping out incomplete runs is consider holding all the state in one class and using marshal to save

thing i quite is how you plan to prune your you have 2m rows per but you specified how much data you plan to at some point you will want to expire data by age all this want to do it by dropping not by executing a delete which locks up every single partition for an incredibly long time it has to do a full table scan to find the rows to then leaves your table no smaller as the partitions are full of by hash of might seem sensible for but partitioning by time could ease contention when you come to prune old and will definitely be a good has a feature called which you will almost definitely need to use all the time in order to achieve concurrency and this mandates a meaning that you can only do deletes by dropping dropping partitions is also good because you can get the disc space said all of 80g that big and i might have been tempted to store it all in a single and use innodb to enable concurrent and if you did use you could have a primary key of which means it would cluster rows with the same probably want a secondary index on to enable efficient test this with your production data sizes and let us know what you	
thing i think you need to consider is that a generic collection is not always a drop in replacement for a for can simply be plugged in for an instance of they have very different behavior in a number of scenarios that can and will break switching between these two collections forces a good programmer to examine the use cases to ensure the differences do not bite	
thing to watch out for particularly if you are using a is to check if the application is regenerating session ids between requests anything that depends explicitly on the session id will run into although obviously the rest of the data in the session will the application is regenerating session ids like this then you can end up with a situation where an ajax request in effect invalidates replaces the session id in the requesting

think part of includes knowing malicious but at the same you necessarily need to know all of the techniques in order to defend against them knowing about attacks the reason to try and protect your buffers from you protect them from overflowing because if they it could wreak havoc in your program regardless of whether a bug or an you write very thoroughly checked and well architected then the malicious attacks will be unable to because good architecture should automatically lock out and unauthorized that last paragraph assumes that we have a perfect job where we are given incredible amounts of time to make our code since such a job then knowing the malicious techniques is a good because it means that although your code you can create for those exploits to make sure that they do not get those make the code and they make the application knowing malicious exploits is something that is good to be aware but of them will be covered by simply making sure you adhere to best

think you probably need to split this logic into two parts and check for null static bool if return if is return as return static bool if is return return null the isnull relying on the fact that valuetype objects be null by definition so if value happens to be a class which derives from we already know not on the other if not a value type then we can just compare value cast to an object against we could avoid the check against valuetype by going straight to a cast to but that would mean that a value type would get boxed which is something we probably want to avoid since it implies that a new object is created on the the isnullorempty checking for the special case of a for all other comparing the value already know is against default value which for all reference types is null and for value types is usually some form of zero these the following code behaves as you might public class public string mystring static void int i1 int i2 i3 i4 string s1 string s2 string s3 string s4 myclass mc1 new myclass mc2 public static void t public static bool public static bool

think your best option is to use the built in localization resources of the you can read more about the mechanics of that for using a database to store your localised elements images and the this is certainly a common but i think mostely because developers understand getting data from a more than working with satellite assemblies and the there a number of problems with using a so name only a added complexity of deployment of the application addtional load on the database where do you store the localized messages to say that the database is down some sort of text file also carries with it some deployment but more importanly the percieved flexibility of making text changes the is somewhat over apart of spelling mistakes and awkward wording almost always be shipping a new build as the text of your app

this about the possibility of someone malicious altering your code to do something you program it to or is it about the possibility of random errors messing up your in the latter you probably have to worry because the error rates on modern computers are something like 1 in less than one per processor per and if even that is intolerable you can use algorithms to reduce the effective error rate as close to zero as you want the cost of needing more time to do a given hackers worried really no expectation of security at someone in physical control of a computer in modify it to do absolutely anything that can conceivably be done by a they could disassemble your code and alter assembly instructions at if they to make your program behave however they want it we usually worry about this in because most of us writing anything worth the effort to those who programmers designing military encryption hardware or nuclear missile control can fall back on hardware which makes it extremely difficult to alter the stuff can be might want to take a look at a book called by ross which describes some of this and in general how people who need to secure their code can do

thoughts on the but make sure you design your scheme well enough that any one folder is not overloaded with images and it becomes something of a nightmare to for you can tree it out with first or last letters of the or subsequent positional your mileage will so make sure the scheme fits your data set no need to go to detailed lengths if only 20 sql server it has a new datatype called filestream while will save the images to the filesystem but allow you to retrieve it via standard database see for more exclusive but at the very recommend option for the sheer fact that get better performance out of using a rather than storing and reading blobs out of a	
thoughts on what the variable length struct idiom allows you to perform one free store allocation per which is half as many as would be required if contained a if you are allocating a large number of then performing half as many free store may very well be if you are also doing network then the time spent waiting for the network will probably be more structure represents a are you planning to from a socket directly into a if you probably need to consider byte are you going to have to convert from host to network byte order when sending and vice versa when receiving if then you could the data in place in your variable length if you converted this to use a it would make sense to write methods for serializing deserializing the these methods would transfer it a contiguous taking byte order into you may need to take alignment and packing into can never subclass if you then the member variables would overlap with the of and you could use p and since is a pod type and does not currently benefit from having its default constructor and its destructor the benefit of doing so is that the global handles errors using the global if that matters to is possible to make the variable length struct idiom work with the new and delete but not you could create a custom that takes an array length by implementing operator unsigned int but you would still have to set the bitlength member if you did this with a you could use the slightly redundant expression p to allocate a the only benefit i see compared to using global and would be that clients of your code could just call instead of wrapping the in separate functions of calling is fine as long as they get called

to answer my own but i think i have assembled from a variety of including some of the answers a concise answer to my question addressing the differences in object lifecycles when transitioning to a gc gc object happens in the constructor which is called when the first reference is added to happens in destructor which is called when last variable referencing object goes out of scope or is explicitly set to object happens in the constructor which is called when the first reference is added to happens in the dispose which must be explicitly called by the client or implicitly called at the end of a using this is specifcially to free up resources that must be released immediately and not wait on the happens in finalize method which is called on the which can be if the finalize method is it is called unless the has been called previously on the object from within the dispose to flag it as already cleaned i get this feel free to edit if i missed something	
to answer the first question i agree with not a big fan of this optimistic especially if you have timestamp columns or any fields which are not guaranteed to be the same after an update address the second question i know of any way to override default approach we ended up writing a tool which sets updatecheck never for appropriate using a batch file to call sqlmetal and afterwards running the while i think of it it was also a treat to find that sqlmetal also models relationships to set a foreign key to null instead of on join tables in we had to use the same tool to set these appropriately

to write programs correctly is extremely difficult and time the first step replace the implementation with one that use multiple threads at carefully put threading back in and only you discover a genuine need for when figured out some very simple safe ways to do a implementation that works reliably is far better than a broken threaded ready to favour designs that use queues to transfer work items between threads and take care to ensure that those work items are accessed only by one thread at a to avoid just spraying blocks around your code in the hope that it will become it two code paths will acquire the same locks in a different and everything will grind to a halt every two on a this is especially likely if you combine threads with firing and you hold the lock while you fire the event the handler may take out another and now you have a pair of locks held in a particular what if taken out in the opposite order in some other this is such a big and difficult subject that i think it is potentially misleading to give a few pointers in a short answer and say you sure not the intention of the many learned people giving answers but that is the impression many get from summarised this is a very nicely worded summary this also comes the biggest is that can lead to vastly more having multiple threads not in itself create the interaction between the that creates this whether or not the interaction and can result development as well as ongoing susceptibility to and for it pays to keep interaction in a simple or not use multithreading all unless you have a penchant for and summary from traditional way of dealing with concurrency by letting a bunch threads loose in a single address space and then using locks to try cope with the resulting data races and coordination problems probably the worst possible in terms of correctness

use setattribute on html ie gets it badly wrong in many and the properties are faster and easier to is why are you converting it to a string and surrounding it with single it looks like you are trying to do something heinous involving evaluating code in a string is what doing below in the evaluating javascript code in strings is almost always the wrong avoid it like the in the above ie should do the same as it is a i guess what trying to do is make it remember that string by constructing a code string that will evaluate in javascript to the original what happens if has an apostrophe or a got a syntax error and possible security you could do something laborious and annoying try to escape the but ugly and work for other you could even ask javascript to do it for not all objects can even be converted to evaluatable javascript source basically the entire approach is doomed to normal thing to do if you just want to have the onclick callback call a function with a parameter is to write the code in the straightforward this will work and is what you there a slight wrinkle which you may have hit which could be what is confusing you into considering the wacky approach with the if in this case is the variable of an enclosing the reference to do what you think it the will be accessed by the callback function when the click is the loop has at this point the variable will be left with whatever value it had at the end of the so will always be the last element of regardless of which was for some discussion of one of the biggest causes of confusion with closures in both javascript and and should really be fixed at a language level some can get around the loop problem by encapsulating the closure in its own like return in a later version of be able to say you would like to be able to use in browsers you can get an implementation from the or just in var var return return arguments args

view has always been that the appropriate way to handle this depends on the target audience and how your class is going to be the caller of your is going to realize that they are calling into win32 in one form or i would use option you have this seems the most to if this is the name your class in a manner that makes it clear that the win32 api is going to be used that being there are exceptions in the bcl that actually subclass win32exception to be more instead of just wrapping for socketexception derives from never personally used that but it does seem like a potentially clean way to handle the caller of your class is going to have no idea that calling into the win32 api i would handle the and use a more descriptive exception you for if using your and no indication that using the win32 api using it internally for some i would have no reason to suspect that i may need to handle a you could always document but it seems more reasonable to me to trap it and give an exception that would have more meaning in your specific business in this i might wrap the initial win32exception as an inner exception your case but depending on what caused the internal i might there are many times when a win32exception would be thrown from a native but there are other exceptions in the bcl that are more this is the case when calling into a native api that but there are similar functions that are wrapped in the in that i would probably trap the make sure that it is what but then throw the bcl exception in its a good example of this would be to use securityexception instead of throwing a i would avoid option 2 and 3 you two throws a general exception type i would pretty much recommend avoiding that it seems unreasonable to wrap a specific exception into a more generalized three seems redundant really no advantage over option

wanted to know how others have layered their say i have my layers as the imp go into this of iproductrepository in my when a new product is created i have a requirement to assign a product id by calling into the the service has a dependency on the repository i set up the productservice ctor with an interface of iproductrepository which can be injected something like public class productservice private iproductrepository public public long return issue is that when i use the service in the product class i am making reference to the repository in the ctor when instantiating a new productservice in ddd its a big no no to have such a am not even sure if my product domain class is being set up correctly to call the can someone pls class product private productservice private iproductrepository public address doesnt seem right to put parm for iproductrepository in the this is where i pass the where to create an instance of can i elegantly solve this design i am open to suggestions from experienced for you i also doubted if the service should be called from the product i have not used a factory pattern as the construction of the object is still i dont feel it warrants a factory method am the productid aside if my product class needed some other data from a service bad example but trying to demonstrate a non db where would this service method be in ddd are logic dumps where the logic is not natrual to the domain so how does it glue dependecies between domain services and

was a book i read last year by steve sanderson that briefed me on ddd even though the book was on mvc as a he really focused on the in mvc as a true and pure domain model using almost the book on modeling approaches i very much one thing he approached was using value objects in the context of aggregate roots he also showed how to use linq to represent the as well as the value point he noted the limitation of linq that it must have an identity on every including value he acknowledged it broke the pure domain model it was the only way to get it to work with was to give your value object an make that identity internal so it is not exposed outside of your this will allow you to link and share your objects using linq in your while not exposing it to the client layers it is as though they are value objects entity framework i believe suffers from the same example is class isdbgenerated autosync public int entityid public string insert business rules if need class make your identity isdbgenerated autosync internal int valueobjectid everything else public string myproperty

was thinking about some stuff lately and i was wondering what would be the right way to do something like the following scenario sure it is a quite common thing for db guys to do something like say you have a products something like this table not null default key key default out of the ordinary now lets say that there are a hierarchy of categories in a different and there is a separate table which binds relationships with products table so that each product belongs to some kind of a category omit because thats not the issue comes the interesting part what if each of the categories mandates additional set of variables to the product for example products in the computer monitors category must have enum screen size enum and some other lets say ice creams have some other variables like flavor shelf storage time int problem herein lies in that all products have a common set of variables description and sort of like but there are additional variables which are not consistent from category to category but all products should share common because in the end they all belong to the products so one can query for example select from products order by maybe not but you get the i see severa potential generate separate table for each product category and store products there with appropriate additional variables stupid and not query product table stays the same with common and for each category create a separate table with additional variables binding two tables with a join but query performance and clarity issues how would one filter down products from category table and additional filter for extra variable lcd monitors it would require sql join products table stays the same and add another variable type text that holds for example json data that hold additional variables compact and but filter through variables with know missing something quite obvious and simple here a bit rusty on the normalization techniques been searching around stackoverflow before asking this question without after posted the question i have clicked on one of my tags and found several similar questions which resulted in to look up specialization relational point of the story is that this must be the first occurrence in my internet life that tags are actually useful in i would still like to hear from you guys and your the problem with approach is that i expect somewhere around there is a hierarchy level of categories and end nodes add specialized variables they accumulate in the order of so it would be a bit unpractical to add specialized tables to join due to the vast number of attribute volatility in my case attribute that was suggested looks like the way to here comes query thanks would you model data variables variance on common

way is to enable webservice trace by wcf services do not report detailed information as service errors are technology specific to that service and should not transcend the service you would need to write additional code to disclose detailed exception enabling service tracing will allow you to log service calls and and see the stack without the additional and polluting your client with service exception quickest way to do this is to use the wcf service configuration editor tools in once you run the open config file that contains your service in the editor go to diagnostics menu and click clicking on the trace level options will bring up an dialog set the trace level to click on servicemodeltracelistener and check the callstack option maybe change the path of the log file for your you double click the file that is microsoft service trace viewer will fire up that will show you what the service is

why would you wish to do that makes things asynchronous so that the user forced to sit and wait while data is coming would be a very poor user expereince if each time an app requested data the user had to wait on it coming back before anything else could you need synchronus if making say 2 calls and call 2 comes in before call but 2 relies on the data inside 1 then left with either fire off event 2 till 1 comes back will slow down your app much like synchronus or implement a way to check that event 1 has come back in event handler are many ways you could do firing off many events then why not have a wrapper class of some description that tracks your events and do anything on the responses until all events are can use the asynctoken to keep track of individual so if you are firing of loads at once then you can find out exaclty whats come back and whats

working on a project where a bunch of software is being ported to a new hardware a certain percentage of the software modules should be subjectively similar on the new hardware code review for some of these modules has shown that the port done is been done with a minimal effort or insight the developers doing the work are as often happens with however it has also shown that the design of the software is lacking either handles error conditions badly or just has a bunch of have asked that instead of reviewing code after the port has been we review the design i am told that this might not be a good use of probably because the existing documented designs are not up to i barking up the wrong is a design process inherently is there a way to avoid getting bogged down in the full design or is hands on code always the best way to sort things out even with inexperienced for the answers so yes the will be used in many future also i mention that the code is going to be too a single threaded this alone maybe good enough to indicate the i would like to proactively see if a process of design review can be put into distrustful of just hoping to fix something up when it stops working if something is found in testing to be fundamentally broken rather not redesign come defect fixing the process of design

would suggest that you familiarize yourself with the history of i know that doing so has given me a much greater appreciation of what php is today and where it has come php was written by rasmus lerdorf to provide simple wrapper functions for the c code that was actually doing the so that he could have a simpler language syntax for writing templates that needed to behave the growth of php and the community which surrounds it is best described as and much like other things that grow its more than a little and downright you understand php and its you need to embrace php for everything that it is and everything that it is this idea was best presented by terry chay in his article without specifically talking about the concept of funky but he captures the concept of coding for php as if it were php and not favorite language better than anyone ever in other try to make php into etc because if you do fail and hate your a look at is php done the right must say that you must and always avoid the tendency of most beginning php developers to use the in other if you find that writing code that contains sql manipulation of validation of and html output all in a single php then doing it order to avoid it will be helpful to learn something about the nature of design this of course precludes a familiarity with but once learned the basics of programming in study the mvc design you have to implement this exactly but using the basic ideas of will allow you to avoid the blob script problem that most newbies tend to this i would strongly recommend that you take any code snippets you find on the web with a grain of and even if you find it in a book have to consider how old the book php as a language has advanced quite a long ways and you just take code samples at face value depending on their they may be using workarounds that were valid in or but simply are no longer necessary with newer great thing to do is to study the various frameworks out evaluate what you like and what you maybe even work up each of the quickstarts that are provided with the framework documentation so that you can start to get an idea of what you like and and i would strongly recommend that you review the code from the frameworks as well as several other projects so that you can get a feel for how others do things in take it all with a grain of salt because every php developer has their own pet peeves and nuances and none of us is right all the in most of the time with php there are going to be several pretty good ways to do you want to get a better understanding of the patterns that are being implemented by the frameworks and are commonly thrown around in the common vernacular on i would suggest that you read and teach all about the basic design patterns use in your development watch for the

you mean the message passing the best approach is to write the output strings to a buffer and send them to the rank 0 this process should be used not for doing the real work but just for filtering and outputting the output the other ranks to do the real i think your above solution will work because i is local to each also want to use the messaging to stop the individual ranks they can since they will be unable to do their sorting work in the have each rank 1 through n do work and send strings to rank the strings could be of the form where n is the rank and s is the rank 0 could then filter out specific messages or write different messages to different then combine them once all the working ranks had shut

your application is under vb6 then i strongly recommend that do the redesign to a class hierarchy in vb6 the reason for this is that in any conversion you try to preserve the behavior of the old is stretches out the project time to do this and do a redesign at the same making the design changes in the applications original language first then you are assured that any bugs that result are due to the design not the done three major conversions of our software in the past 20 to to object oriented design in and to it is straight forward to make a design in vb6 that is ports over to the trick is to hide the specific vb6 apis and constructs behind a interface do the conversion i recommend working from the top change over your forms first to which calls the vb6 com then convert each layer over until you reach the bottom if you try to change the design and convert to another language for any complex application you will double the conversion
