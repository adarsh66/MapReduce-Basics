a brief has been asked somewhat frequently a q and i answered bascially this same question before however to be more specific to your need to know a bit more beyond what already described besides from an enterprise library think you meant the rumors true that to will be also been previously discussed but the short answer is not in the immediate need to discuss a little more about your broader imho either will work fine in the architecture described free to provide more ask some more questions such will you ever need to support a database other than sql would you ever use esql or just stick with linq based suggest creating a proof of concept with your orm of choice first and migrate a of ui ws dal and see what kind of issues you run what suggest is that you consider how either l2s or ef will be used within your especially with regard to the entities themselves change rule out other such as nhibernate or using codesmith templates to generate data access unless already decided on l2s or

ad for your authentication is a great since you need to add everyone there and for intranet users no need for an extra correct that allows you to use a provider which will allow you to authenticate against although nothing included to give you group membership support quite trivial to implement if you want i can provide a real issue here is if you want to use ad groups to define permissions within each so then you do have the option of creating your own roleprovider for that can also be used by winforms and wpf apps via this roleprovider could link the id of the user in ad to per app which you can store in your own custom which also allows each app to allow administration of these roles without requiring these admins to have extra privileges in you want you can also have an override and combine app roles with ad so if in some global group in ad they get full permission in the app regardless of app role conversely if they have either a group or property in ad to say been fired you could ignore all app role membership and restrict all access hr probably remove them from each and every assuming they even know about them code added as based on this original work your

am developing a java web application that bases it behavior through large xml configuration files that are loaded from a web as these files are not actually required until a particular section of the application is they are loaded when one of these files are a query is sent to the webservice to retrieve the corresponding as some of the configuration files are likely to be used much more often than others like to setup some kind of caching maybe a 1 hour expiration to avoid requesting the same file over and files returned by the web service are the same for all users across all i do not use jsf or any other fancy just plain question what is considered a best practice to implement such a static cache within a java web is a singleton class or will there be weird behaviors due to the j2ee should i expose something somewhere through what shall i do so that my cache get screwed in clustered environments but not to have one cache per clustered the informations would it be a correct implementation to put an object responsible for caching as a servletcontext i do not want to load all of them at startup and be done with it because that would overload the webservice whenever my application starts the files might change while my application is so i would have to requery them i would still need a globally accessible so my question still using a caching proxy as may be a good but each request to the webservice will send rather large xml query in the post which may be different each only the web application really knows that two different calls to the webservice are actually for your web how to implement caching

am trying to play fancy games which have the compiler synthesize hash values of constant strings at this would let me replace the string with a single with a massive savings in code size and programming clarity and be awesome if i could examine and compute at compiletime with simple inline character strings like which are compiletime constant pointers to compiletime constant i can index into these at i can make a template metaprogram to do what i but it is unclear if the standard treats a index of a array as by another const char quite valid but the value v a compile time already believe the answer is but in practice some compilers accept it without even any much less for the following compiles and runs without even a single warning from char void c const char the tricky and interesting compiler will not compile at giving a reasonably coherent error message about using a template with an object with internal suspect the answer to my question is you assume any array reference even to a constant array with a constant index is constant at does this mean the intel successful execution is a bug in the intel a compiletime constant index into a compiletime constant array itself compiletime

am working on a program where i want to be able to add functionality using so i will create an example to see if this is have a program that a user enters any two program then looks at all the plugins in an xml file and uses those classes that are injected to calculate with these two i create two add and i put them in and run my i would like to have the program find these two classes and show the results after going through the someone else writes drops it into a updates the xml and next time i run my with two there are three i know how many plugins there will there any way in using that i can get this type of know if it is am trying to figure this out as i want to show a way to graph some using different types of but i think using the binary equation approach makes explaining i could do this by manually loading the class referenced in the xml so it can be i would like to have a dependency framework take care of the heavy work for i am hoping to use the unity framework for di to add new equations for calculating using 2

am working on a project which will be using large datasets 2d and which i will be turning into or in order to render will also be performing calculations on these which to use for each calculation depend on the greatest and smallest values of their i need to sort the in order of their greatest valued have tried and binary insertion quicksort so far offers the quickest solution but it is still quite slow due to the size of the data was thinking along the lines of a sort when creating the in the first a bucket for each of the greatest valued vertices adding pointers to the triangles who all have that value as the value of their greatest valued approach should be linear in but requires more memory this is not an but my programming language of choice is and not entirely sure how i would go about coding such a thing my question to you how would you go about getting the in such a way that you could iterate through from the triangle whos vertex with the greatest value of its 3 vertices is the greatest valued vertex in the entire data all the way down to the triangle with the the smallest greatest vertex to sort a bunch of by a specific value at their vertices some other distance

an interesting is there a way to write some code using linq to sql which is capable of performing a table update knowing only that the table it is given contains columns z but not knowing at compile time which table it is dealing have several tables in my db schema which share some columns and i need to apply a set based update operation which is identical in its logical procedure regardless of which one of the tables dealing a simple say you have 3 tables which implement an adjacency model hierarchy each row contains a primary key id and a parent id each of the tables also has a boolean when i disable an instance of any of these it should cascade through the child disabled id or want to be writing these kind of linq statements for each it violates it might seem trivial with this but as the example gets more complex duplicating increasing amounts of sure it must be possible using an interface and perhaps but struggling to come up with an elegant linq statements for tables with common

answer is developers will need to frig with system configurations to test install software nothing to test the installation process of whatever they happen to be poke about the registry and run software that will not work properly without admin privileges to list a few there are a host of other tasks integral to development work that require administration privileges to in mind that development staff do not necessarily have root access to production admin rights on a local pc does not significantly compromise security of production there is almost no legitimate operational reason for restricting admin access to local pcs for staff that need it to do their the most important reason to provide administrative access is that setting up a compromised or second rate development environment sends a message to your development value your work so little that we are prepared to compromise your ability to do your for no good in we quite happy to do this to cover our pander to the whims petty bureaucracy because we simply be just the best the case is that really the type of control freaks that view it our perogative to tell you how do your job and what you do or need to do make do with given and be that got a job at providing a alone fundamentally work environment for development staff is a recipe for the natural consequences of pissing off your staff inability to retain competent high staff poor morale and poor quality going out of your way to do so particularly if an overtone of pandering to bureaucratic whim is just in mind that your staff turnover just incur costs of replacing the the most serious cost of staff turnover is that most of the ones that stick around will be the deadwood that get a better over time this degrades the capabilities of the departments if your industry is sufficiently close you can also find yourself getting a point to note is that administrative privileges are far less of an issue for development on or mainframe systems than it is on on these platforms a user can do far more in their own domain without needing you will probably still want root or sudo access for but not having this will get underfoot much less this flexibility is a significant but lesser known reason for the continuing popularity of operating systems in computer science

anyone noticed this odd behavior of application that utilize d3d or opengl when they go to full screen in it applies only when applications go to full screen and then switch back to window or they either shuffle window positions of other applications i am on single monitor or move all the other applications windows to another screen when i am on multiple monitor would take this for granted if there for applications that show this two my question would be what exactly does one need to take care of when writing an application to alleviate these two i am not sure if this problem exists on other platforms besides primary setup concerning this is but i presume this applies to whatever setup you have since it seems to be platform api thing that needs to be taken care here is some more clarification on my problem persists even on same resolution as desktop it does not seem to be related to resolution because seen that even when they are not in the same resolution as when they switch windows on desktop are restored as they once were before the full screen application was it looks like it is a resolution switch windows least does not seem to remember positions and size case of multiple monitor of applications looks like only solution is the one i provided in an answer to the question even though it seems like something os should at least as an api call or still not convinced this is the only there must be an easy way of easy to preserve other application windows sizes and positions when changing to and from full screen game in other resolution than desktop

are several problems with the example you number one problem is that you are selecting the columns using jquery inside the this is a major performance if you have any control over the html code i would suggest you use normal dom methods to get the desired colum you want to sort note that sometimes when you might expect a table cell you may get a text get back to that a for loop is faster so you may consider using that instead of but i suggest you benchmark took your example and created a table with 1000 it took about 750ms on my machine to sort i did some optimizations code and managed to get it down to the sorting itself took around 20ms sb i i x rows columnindex t new new return new tbody delete you write for speed you want each iteration to be as quick as so do stuff in the loops that you can do outside of for moving outside of the last loop sped things up for using dom methods to access a what you need is the column so you could iterate over the th columns until you find the correct one the html formatting is identical for th tags and td you can then use that index to get the correct row child if the table is static and the users are liable to do more sorting on you should cache the rows and not delete the sortkey then you save about sort there is also the matter of the table if the content is this sorting method is if it contains numbers then you need to consider since i am using localecompare which is a method of the string	
are so many different java enterprise technologies pretty hard to know where to as previously the head first jsp servlets book is i currently work on an enterprise app that was made years ago with just we have migrated over to as time has gone on but we are not using any of the newer so it is for sure a valid way to do although thing about is that most enterprise development is a conjunction of a bunch of different for you could create an app using for the views with a servlet using hibernate for you db jdom for your junit for your testing log4j or aspectj for your logging lucene for jboss for deployment deployment can be pretty you going to go out and learn all of those technologies in the next 3 i would suggest is previously to pick a and there are many to choose from such as that will abstract away a lot of the underlying any java technology you pick will have a good community behind it willing to thing to since you seem to be in a hurry to get things is that my opinion at java is not a fast language to build things it is very verbose and unless you grasp the nuances of good java web design it is very easy to shoot yourself in the perhaps you should look at some of the other technologies that are available on the jvm that you have all the java libs such as allows you the ability to program with java syntax if you or a dynamic grails is pretty much a rails clone for groovy and will let you write a web app in no time at you choose to good luck and welcome to the wonderful world of java web

are two ways for specifying parameters in one is using an identifier and the other is using a parameter type the identifier list can be but the type list can to say that one function takes no arguments in a function definition you do this with an identifier do something this with a parameter type do something in a parameter type list the only one parameter type is void must have no name then that means the function takes no but those two ways of defining a function have a difference regarding what they first defines that the function takes a specific number of but neither the count is communicated nor the types of what is needed as with all function declarations that use identifier so the caller has to know the types and the count precisely so if the caller calls the function giving it some the behavior is the stack could become corrupted for because the called function expects a different layout when it gains identifier lists in function parameters is it was used in old days and is still present in lots of production they can cause severe danger because of those argument promotions the promoted argument type do not match the parameter type of the function behavior is undefined and are much less of so always use the thingy for functions without in both and definitions of type second one defines that the function takes zero arguments and also communicates that like with all cases where the function is declared using a parameter type which is called a if the caller calls the function and gives it some that is an error and the compiler spits out an appropriate second way of declaring a function has plenty of one of course is that amount and types of parameters are another difference is that because the compiler knows the parameter it can apply implicit conversions of the arguments to the type of the if no parameter type list is that be and arguments are converted to promoted types is called the default argument will become for while will become type for the if a file contains both an omitted identifier list and a parameter type the parameter type list the type of the function at the end contains a f has now a is because both declarations do not say anything the had something to say in which is that one argument is the same can be done in int first defines a function using an identifier while the second then provides a prototype for using a declaration containing a parameter type

basic idea is to write the wcf code for your clients in just easier this and use a bridge dll to bridge the gap between your unmanaged code and the managed wcf code written in is the process using visual studio 2008 along with first thing to do is create the wcf service and a means to host if you already have skip to step 7 create a windows nt service following the steps from use the default names offered by vs2008 for the project and any classes that are added to the this windows nt service will host the wcf a wcf service named helloservice to the to do the project in the solution explorer window and select the menu in the add new item select the wcf service template and click the add this adds the helloservice to the project in the form of an interface file a class file and a default service configuration file the helloservice like public interface string public class helloservice public string return the service1 class created in step 1 above to look like partial class service1 private servicehost public protected override void string args new helloservice protected override void try if catch the the visual studio 2008 command navigate to the output directory for the type the this installs the windows nt service on your local open the services control panel and start the service1 it is important to do this in order for step 9 below to another instance of visual studio 2008 and create an mfc which is about as far away as you can get from as an i simply created a dialog mfc application and added a say button to the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu under the general change the output directory to under the general add to the additional include under the linker general add to the additional library click the ok the file select the menu select the class library change the name to helloserviceclient and click the ok the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu in the build change the output path to so the assembly and file will be in the same directory as the mfc this library will contain the service the wcf proxy to the wcf hello service hosted in the windows nt the solution the references folder for the helloserviceclient project and select the add service menu in the address type the address of hello this should be equal to the base address in the file created in step 2 click the go the hello service should show up in the services click the ok button to automatically generate for the hello seem to always run into compilation problems with the file generated by this i know if doing it wrong or if there is a but the easiest way to fix this is modify the file the problem is usually a namespacing issue and can be fixed with minimal just be aware that this is a for this changed the to simply helloservice with any other required allow the mfc application to interact with the wcf we need to build a managed from the file select the menu select the win32 project change the name to helloserviceclientbridge and click the ok for the application change the application type to dll and check the empty project click the finish first thing to do is modify the project the project in the solution explorer and select the properties menu under the general change the output directory to and change the common language runtime support option to common language runtime support under the references add a reference to the and mscorlib click the ok the following files to the helloserviceclientbridge project and the to look like dllapi dllapi comment if link dllapi static const the to look like dllapi helloserviceclientbridge syntax for the file uses managed which takes some getting used modify the to look like namespace namespace namespace namespace const binding gcnew address gcnew client gcnew try call to wcf hello message marshal from managed string back to unmanaged intptr ptr rv catch return only thing left to do is update the mfc application to invoke the on the mfc the say button to generate the buttonclicked event make the event handler look like try message name catch the application and click the say this will cause the application the method of the wcf hello service hosted in the windows nt service should still be by the the return value is then displayed in a message you can extrapolate from this simple example to fit your if this does not please let me know so i can fix the

been batting this problem around in my head for a few days now and come to any satisfactory conclusions so i figured i would ask the so crew for their for a game that working on using a component object model as described and actually going fairly well but my current storage solution is turning out to be limiting can only request components by their class name or an arbitrary what i would like is the ability to request a given type and iterate through all components of that type or any type derived from considering this first implemented a simple rtti scheme that stores the base class type through the derived type in that this means that the rtti a sprite would this allows me to compare types easily to see if type a is derived from type b simply by comparing the all elements of is derived from but not and already i want now is a way to store the components in a way that represents that the first thing that comes to mind is a tree using the types as like timer sprite each node i would store a list of all components of that that way requesting the node will give me access to all renderable components regardless of derived the rub is that i want to be able to access those components with an so that i could do something like have that iterate over the entire tree from renderable i have this pretty much working using a really ugly node structure and an custom forward iterator that tracks a node stack of where all the while i felt that there must be a clearer i just think of one the question am i this is there some obvious simplification or structure i should be or is this just inheritly a complex problem and probably doing just fine for any input you for hierarchal component

been thinking of answering this for a but figured someone else might come up with a better because mine is rather not aware of any such unit testing think your best bet is to try and refactor your c module such that dependencies on the httpd code base are contained in a very thin glue i worry too much about dependencies on that can easily be linked into your unit test things like using the request record that you should try to abstract out a little go as far and suggest that such a refactoring is a good idea if the code is suspected to contain security flaws and bad just usually a pretty big you might also consider is running integration tests rather than unit tests come up with a set of requests and expected responses from the and run a program to compare the actual to expected not the response been looking and you probably thought of something along this line but at least i can tell you from experience that if the module be replaced with something new for business then refactoring it for testability will likely pay off in the longer

been using castle windsor in my previous project and i liked it a for my current project looking to use a different ioc castle windsor had any new releases since 2007 and is still not at version so it is hard to justify using it in a commercial of the things i like about castle windsor is that you can have the container call an initialize method on your services after all dependencies have been set simply by making the service implement i used this a it makes it easy to do property injection instead of constructor injection and that cleans up code and tests quite a been looking at unity and as alternatives but of these only supports something it automatically calls an unfortunately does not really support the way i want to work with an ioc container injects based on string keys instead of interface declarations and therefore its autowiring support is limited i miss a similar feature in the ioc containers i looked is my way of working with ioc containers wrong or are there other ioc containers that do support something like iinitializable or other ioc containers have an iinitializable like

depends a lot on how going to use the existing if grabbing the source and modifying it to do new got a bigger problem than if just reusing existing libraries or you are taking code and changing you need permission from the original copyright holders to distribute your changes to their code under the gplv3 which you can either try to get explicitly them an or maybe already have apache license for gpl if the code was gpled with the your any later or under a bsd you should be fine just reusing existing programs as often fine anyway though when you redistribute something under gplv2 or gplv3 often be required to distribute everything people need to actually use the as well as the code the more the other software is throw out the gplv2 stuff and put in some other implementation from someone else the better off you are on that	
depends on how your message is sent and how you call if the target window is owned by the current the call bypasses the message queue for the window and the window manager directly calls the windowproc on the target if the target window is owned by another the window manager effectively calls postmessage and pumps window messages until the target window returns from the window you call the window manager marshals the message parameters and inserts the corresponding object onto the message queue for the target when it next calls getmessage the message is removed from the message window manager also registers for raw input events from the input devices and it generates messages for those input it then inserts those messages in the queue as appropriate processing of input events is complicated because it depends on what messages are already in the message queue for the stefan translatemessage just translates accelerator keys for instance it converts key sequences to

every break on the getting to the root of the exception is very crucial and time taking the web applications are in multi user environment and stateless asynchronous really a tough job to look at the eventviewer log files and root cause an issue reported by the end also it depends on how educated the to explain the issue in came up with a creative way to log the which makes the job easier for the end user and dev will follow a signature to log the exceptions into an xml and which can be processed remotely for viewing or reports on signature of the static method in the error logging class is as number module layer custom with stack know there are many reusable exception handling but what i was looking at is a unique number to track the issue that should get displayed to the end back to the user the exception is expected to handled and consumed then up the developer to show the valid message to the end incase of any unexpected or exception is thrown to the application layer global the response would be cleared and custom message in html will be written back to the user with the unique id like the below an unexpected error has occurred the exception has be recorded for further please use the number to communicate the support team details number this is the unique number generated for every a read only property in the errorlogging class which would be unique per exception this would be concatenation of the initially i thought to use guid but then it would be tough for the end user to remember the guid to report the string strexceptionid get return name this would be a static enum variable with module modulename module3 this would be a static enum variable with priority developer has to decide the priority like if a validation fail of date or integer format use or if its unexpected in a business layer call then use think priority high should be used in only in dal or in business logic layer or like if the interface to sap or ariba enum priority high medium low would be a static enum variable with layer enum layer dataaccess custom message is optional and its upto the developer to supply an information to help explain the reason or empty string can be with stack trace this would the exception object which would be further processed inside the processing done inside the error log method method will additionally get the userid and timestamp and write it to the xml xml logging will enable us to process an use it in any the exceptions can be viewed remotely in a easy to trace and find any we can search sort exception based on priority time stamp we can generate reports module level layer wise priority dependency on the xml if its lost all the exceptions would go for a we can overcome this in two writing the xml to db on timely basis or write this on top of event viewer logging as always have the on the review comments post the xml schema and the aspx page to view and search the take time to review and give ur review comments for my error logging

exit the the safest way is to get a handle to the process and kill the winword in the following code would do p in if reason is that it will happen frequently especially since you are testing documents created not by that word will hang with an open message a repair in that case killing the process is the easiest way to close the would suggest that you first try to close word using if this does not work it indicates a problem with your input file likely because a repair dialog is blocking you should record this as an error in your log and then proceed killing the winword problem you might face is document recovery feature blocking the application on startup thus preventing a document from being opened until the recovery dialog box is clicked document recovery can be disabled by deleting the following registry key under both hkcu and hklm prior to starting word with for word 2003 and for word goes without saying that killing word is a rather rude it is simple and rather the code above will just kill any instance of word for a if you want to kill only a specific instance things get more you would have to retrieve the process id of a specific word typically this can be done by searching for the window title of the using winapi functions like and

fastest solution going to get will probably involve storing your dictionary in a create a queue of triplets where each element in the queue corresponds to a prefix of a word which can be spelled in the ending at location initialize the queue with x elements is the size of your one element for each square in the the algorithm proceeds as the queue is not dequeue a triple for each square with letter c adjacent to if is a output if is a prefix of a insert into the you store your dictionary in a testing if is a word or a prefix of a word can be done in constant time you also keep some extra metadata in each queue such as a pointer to the current node in the so the running time of this algorithm is of words that can be an implementation in python that i just coded def if parent is not dict root for word in curnode for letter in if 97 nextnode if nextnode is nextnode curnode return rows cols queue words for y in for x in c node if node is not while node del for dy in y2 x y if 0 x2 cols and 0 y2 s2 s node2 if node2 is not if return this program output or filter by word length at easy to add but not really relevant to the it also outputs some words multiple times if they can be spelled in multiple if a given word can be spelled in many different ways every letter in the grid is the same and a word like is in your then the running time will get horribly filtering out duplicates and sorting is trivial to due after the algorithm has

have done a good job of explaining your so let me help you decode the error match expected type against inferred type the putstrln is show missed off all the other the they just show more and more enclosing in haskell is an so therefore everything has a that includes something like if you type in ghci you will see it string io means that putstrln is a function that takes a string and returns an which in this case is the action of putting the message on the in your code you gave a so the compiler inferred that the expression had the type that is the part of the compiler error the compiler was also doing type inference in the other from the outside amongst other things it noticed that the this expression seemed to be applied to an empty which has type a list of we know furthermore the result of the whole expression should be of type therefore the expression should be a function to turn into a list of the type of which is written that is the part of the error this point the compiler concluded that it could not match up these two so it reported the match expected type against inferred type is probably the commonest error message you get when trying to compile so its worth trying to read it and understand look at the inferred type and try to figure out what part of the quoted expression has that then try to figure out why the compiler expected something else by looking at the surrounding	
have done a similar research in jaas for web application and has ran into a until i finally realize jaas is a framework addressing security at a different then traditional web applications in the java it is build to tackle security issues in j2se not is a security framework build for securing things at a much lower level then some example of these things are code and resources available at the jvm hence all these ability to set policy files in the jvm since j2ee is build on top of a few modules from jaas was reuse in j2ee security such as the loginmodules and the other aka spring tackles a much higher in the securing it is build on top of j2ee security hence j2se hence unless you are looking to secure resources in the j2se level system i see any real use of jaas other than the using the common class and just focus on using acegi or plain old j2ee security which solves a lot of common web application security the end of the it is important to learn which of the security issue you are tackling and choose the write for the

have plenty of answers that explain well how to do but for the sake of completion repeat and add to is only ever useful for interactive use you know all your filenames are plain no spaces or or when used with the break is a very useful put using it to pipe filenames into with is rather convoluted as can do it all itself with either command or command depending on what you somecommand somecommand former runs with for each file recursively in that matches latter runs with many arguments as fit on the command at once for files recursively in that match one to use depends on if it can take multiple filename arguments then the latter option is faster you run far less if takes only one argument then you need the former so look at man on is a statement that iterates over if you do something like foo in giving argument to iterate over the if you do something like foo in asking to take the contents of and tear it apart wherever there are tabs or newlines whatever characters are in and use the pieces of that operation as arguments to is not assuming that the result of a tearing long string that contains filenames apart wherever there is whitespace yields in a pile of filenames is just as you have just answer use obviously the wrong the above commands all assume that is an executable in if a need this construct instead over like you but read somebashstatement uses a loop that reads parts of the string outputs until it reaches a byte is what uses to separate the since bytes be part of filenames tabs and this is a safe you need to be part of your script it change the script environment by keeping a counter or setting a variable or some then you can still use to run your bash bash do somebashstatement the executes a command with three or more bash statement to will put this in you can put anything you like filename or filenames on whether you used or the up in if more than of statement in the first command here runs with the filename as statement in the second command here runs a loop that iterates over each positional parameter what the reduced syntax and runs a with the filename as the difference here between the very first statement i showed with is that we run only one process for lots of filenames but still one for of those this is also well explained in the page linked

here is something that has caused some friction at my current job and i really expect it organized in house software development is a new concept here and i have drawn up a first draft of some coding have proposed that code should never be checked into the the reason i have stated this is that the repository maintains a full history of the if you are removing the functional code then remove it the repository keeps your changes so it is easy to see what was has caused some friction in that another developer believes that taking this route is too this developer would like to be able to comment out some code that he is working on but is this code then would never have been checked in before and then not saved we are going to be using tfs so i suggested that shelving the changes would be the most correct it was not accepted however because he would like to be able to checkin partial changes that may or may not be want to eventually get to a point where we are taking full advantage of continuous integration and automatically deploying to a development web currently there is no development version of web servers or database servers but that will all be changed what are your do you believe that code is useful to have in the very interested to hear from others on this clarity we use private if we did then say do what you want with your private branch but ever merge commented out code with the trunk or any shared is no valid reason we use private or per user not a concept i disagree we just set it up that way perhaps that is the eventual middle for now we use tfs in of

i had a very bitter experience with mq series partially due to the fact that it was pushed on to us microsoft by the partnering the use of mq series any messaging was an integral part to the we were building a process that handled supply chain fullfilment for backorder if our partner a distributor have the items their customers they would send a message into a b2b that would target potential companies that could fulfil the had built two different flavors of the first was an ftp approach where fixed width files were sent back and forth at regular and we had added all sorts of rules to help ensure we miss any second was using mq series where the messages were placed into a queue using guarenteed then we would pop the queue and process the the queing system was great benefit here as it allowed us a reliable way to transmit critical messages that resulted in real money being moved the flip side with the same mq series we had to implement a synchronous query to get we wanted it to be synchronous because our users accessing this via the web would wait to get the doing this over mq series was a very interesting and painful the only reason mq was used here was because it was an existing line of communication and the query functionality already second example and this time was using msmq was a site that collected information from dialhome code injected into client the dialhome code would collect feature usage statistics like sqm when the messages came in to the web service we would drop them on a then we could have any number of application servers popping the messages and pushing them to the database to be rolled into the here ensured we could handle bursts of messages by quickly placing them on the this help the scalability and reliability of the

i just finished watching an episode of so try a differential diagnosis you know that it works with the thin driver from both but expiring in the jboss you say for sure very but it would appear that you have a jboss instance on compb and on and your code runs happily when it runs in the jboss instance on compb but core dumps from the i infer that when you run on talking to the oracle instance on have you tried running the code on compb but talking to have you tried running the code on but talking to the oracle on actual errors indicate a fault occurring in native code in a dynlib module and we know that you have different versions of the oracle stuff on compa and so my first suspicion would be that you have incompatible versions of on the two i observe that you have a different version of oracle on compa and i predict that the code on compb talking to oracle will and that the code on compc talking to compb will want to check the versions of the oracle oci driver software on compb and you can using oci and to both compa and compc connect using but can using to both compa and so it be a server you have this narrowed three connection methods and and three and the only one that fails is using oci from that fails talking to both compa and follows the problem is a configuration problem on compc still failing the since the same code works against compa and compb when running on it has to be a compc not a problem in your against the from compb and from confirm the rcp the compb onto compc and out what went wrong with

i like php but first and it is a templating not a general purpose programming language an fight embrace looked at a few different mvc frameworks like cakephp and zend and i have a hard time getting past the typically they are these 17 files you can make a is such a thing as complexity for sake of it and solving a problem before you have a problem and yet to be convinced that these heavyweight frameworks really adds more of a fan of the this is really your but i think that it leads to the cleanest end feel similarly about a lot of people on so are big fans of smarty but never made sense to me why add a templating language to templating i end up writing this kind of php script most of the set up db connections and so page site menu and so user submitted page validation rules if do db redirect user ie else output error display judicious use of helper functions pagination the above is incredibly easy to read and i also much prefer it to this hopefully you sanitize this but so many find this and even i have a hierarchy of php files that mirrors the site structure a menu point of where each page is a php if they have common behaviour they both require it which is typically used as a hack for poor seems a lot of programmers will throw a framework into the mix before there is really ever any i think this is a fairly lazy practice and one with a big every decision made today is one that becomes harder to change later so put off making decisions like this as long as introducing something later is easier than introducing something finding out it really do what you want and then changing it

inside my organization we are trying to come up some conventions for a pilot soa at first glance we thought it would be best to force users of the service to use the business service direct access to any data endpoints but are there specific scenarios where this is not true or it might be for developers to have access to specific data endpoints outside of a always fear that if we open this it will actually hurt reuse because everyone will just similar business services using the same data as available and would be theory to just write a new business service rather than ask does this other service do that uses my even if the service is almost a direct pass through to the database we would have the ability to apply rules that would save developers time and ultimately the business data access for business services as a separate web service or

is and afraid i offer a good solution to your current situation but brian has given the answer on how to avoid avoidance comes down to a little bit of repository theory basically it must not be possible to modify any source code for your project without a corresponding revision appearing in pointing all externals to tags or specific no changes from them can appear in the main project history without committing a change to the external but if you point an external to a moving a change to the external will not show up in the main timeline at all leaving you in the position taken the view that externals should be treated and released as independent hence all externals point to during heavy parallel fine to an external to or to have an unstable development branch temporarily pointing to an external but the mainline project trunk always points to a stable and a conscious decision to this view may be overkill for your but worth seeing other

is essentially a problem that involves a number of discrete solutions to provide the full essentially there are 3 problems with sitting behind the advertised service endpoint of links to schemas that describe the data problem you the host as you have found solves 1 and 2 can approach this in ways other than host but no need to go into that number 3 is a bit more tricky and requires more code much to dump out short answer is that you need to write a contractbehavior that implements both icontractbehavior and important bit you need to implement is the within this method you need to iterate over all the wsdlport and when you find an extension that is of type soapaddressbinding you need to replace the property with a new uri that contains the https protocol you also need to do similar bits for the xsd import addresses and schema your service is also using you then need to do something similar to handle the additional addresses it writes out to the based the code i ended up writing on the wsdlextras project available on codeplex the method used in the wsdlextras provides a great base for any extra bits you may need to add to it memory i think it dealt with the the bit you want to look at is the soap address location

is valid to have an object that contains an in a standard you run into undefined two common copies its argument into each created the first copy will below why but each further copy will be because the element copied is also something during reallocation you can happen to have some elements copied a new but the copy being thrown away and other elements because must not have any effects if an exception is being thus some of your elements are now this is all about undefined behavior it does not really but even we try to come up with this behavior based on what we think is we would fail all the member functions like and so on have a const reference that takes an object of type a reference of type is tried to copied into elements of the but the implicitly created copy assignment operator looks like that it requires a object to be copied good implementations of the standard library check and fail to compile if the next you have to live with the next one will support element types that are merely that a moved object does not need to be equal to the object moved that will allow putting and into what the standard says for this certain cases handler operations on types used to instantiate standard library template the standard library depends on components supplied by a if these components do not meet their the standard places no requirements on the the effects are undefined in the following types used as template arguments when instantiating a template if the operations on the type do not implement the semantics of the applicable requirements subclause

is when the existence of a row in a child table depends on a row in a parent this may be confusing because common practice these days to create a pseudokey for a child but make the foreign key to the parent part of the primary the way to do this is to make the foreign key part of the primary but the logical relationship is that the child cannot exist without the a has one or more phone if they had just one phone we could simply store it in a column of since we want to support multiple phone we make a second table whose primary key includes the referencing the may think of the phone as belonging to a even though they are modeled as attributes of a separate this is a strong clue that this is an identifying relationship if we literally include in the primary key of is when the primary key attributes of the parent become primary key attributes of the a good example of this is a lookup such as a foreign key on referencing the primary key of is a child table with respect to but a row in is not identified by its is not part of the primary key of relationship can be or which means the foreign key column allows null or disallows also my answer to confused about identifying

it is but not terribly the complicating factor is that decorator actually passes through 2 levels of indirection dynamic function and one other to end up at which is a class with a say you have a decorated function that looks like def return return print results to see if the function has been wrapped can be as simple as checking the function you can do this inside the the name will actually be the name of the last wrapper for more complicated you can use the module to walk up the outer frames from the current frame if looking for something in the case of the fact that the decorator is actually an instance of the class means that the function is not really a and therefore has no trying the above code will raise an at the source code for shows that the instance will have a this is a pretty straightforward thing to test is also used to implement the other auth this approach will also work for never actually had a need to use so i really comment on what you should look for if you have multiple decorators around a single an exercise left to the i guess the frame unrequested editorial i would say checking the function itself to see if it was wrapped like this strikes me as a bit you can probably imagine all sorts of unpredictable behaviour waiting to happen when a new developer comes to the project as slaps on some other in also exposed to changes in the django framework a security risk waiting to would recommend van approach for that reason as something that is and therefore a much more robust

least take advantage of native datatypes that will do wrapping in the fastest for wrapping integers would be to make sure your data is scaled to or whatever native then when you need your data to wrap the native data type will be done in very and orders of magnitude than any software wrapping implementation seen an example case have found this to be very useful when i need a fast implementation of implemented using a for a basically you make scale your data such that is pi and is then have you are set to a side scaling your data will add some up front finite computation cost that usually looks something fixedpoint floatingpoint free to exchange int for something else you want like fastest more the mod operation is slow instead if possible try to use bit of the solutions i skimmed are functionally but they are dependent on the mod mod operation is very slow because it is essentially doing a the laymans explanation of why mod and division are slow is to equate the division operation to some def of and as you can the hardware can be if it is a low number relative to the but division can also horribly slow if it is much greater than the you can scale your data to a power of two then you can use a bit mask which will execute in one cycle on of all platforms and speed improvement will be approximately one order of magnitude at the very least 2 or 3 times faster code to implement int return a b int return a b free to make the something that is run and feel free to adjust the bit mask to be whatever power of two that you like 0xffffffff or power of two you decide on i strongly suggest reading about fixed point processing when messing with i suggest an introduction by randy yates august

like you hit on a hot as a designer i think the best way to improve your ability in that regard is to look at a lot of good actively seek them pixeline not a lot of objective knowledge to be learned there is more about improving your aesthetic if you look at high quality designs all the then your tastes will become more refined and your web designs will naturally conform to your acclimated i work at an indie metal so from time to time called upon to work on band album magazine so always flipping through metal magazines and looking at ads designed by other or admiring the merch designs of other or checking out the sites of other not only serves as a source of inspiration when helps me to gauge my own abilities and find areas for but it also helps me track the trends and fashions in my particular sphere of as we all fashion is and tastes are always a good designer knows how to stay just ahead of the curve all the this means that your designs deviate too drastically from accepted aesthetics your designs will be rejected by but you also want to employ design elements that are overused and played you can ride the edge and innovate enough to stand but not so much that the audience is unable to accept then you will have mastered the art of web a good designer can identify emerging trends and capitalize on while making it their own by adding their own twist to just starting to venture into be afraid to emulate others and steal good and give credit where credit is but just as making copies of famous is an essential training technique in figure drawing so too is emulating quality designs an effective tool in learning graphic like web and are excellent places to immerse oneself in quality designs and i would highly recommend scanning through these sites in your free time to flood your mind with examples of good i also want to emphasize that talent is not as much of a factor as most people would more is what people confuse as if you truly have an interest in you will be motivated to immerse yourself in it and practice this in turn leads to better and if started at a young age builds which leads to an ability which leads to more confidence and more which in turn leads to more consider myself a decent graphic designer can check out my portfolio via my profile and an alright and people often comment on how talented i but they realize that i have literally spent thousands of hours honing my while other kids were out playing with their i was in my room the only reason i excelled in and when i first started building they looked just as hideous as most myspace so get discouraged when you see the work of they all started from humble beginnings as

main benefits of using real foreign keys are ensuring data and being able to set up cascading actions on related items when something is modified or imagine programming a you have a table with primary key and you have a table where posts are attached to topics with the column which is a foreign key to the topics foreign key relationship ensures that every post is attached to a valid if the only topic you have has id impossible for there to exist a post in the database attached to topic the database ensures the cascading you can set it up so that if a topic is deleted from the topic the database automatically deletes all the posts in the posts table that were attached to this this is nice because it removes a step that you have to remember to do which can get quite complex when you have many tables linked with foreign keys all the relationships can be cleaned up

my answer where the is that all algorithms that come immediately to mind have n where n is the size of the whether you choose to do work on the or do work on the algorithm where lists are traded back and fourth may be as a size calculation is not although you still need to loop and compare with can prove this algorithm cannot be written faster than n by noting that the information about the last element in a queue is only available through knowing the size of the and that you must destroy data to get to that hence the 2nd only way to make this faster is to not to use queues in the first import def queue queue contains one item at a temp def stick it in the first is def the queues until q1 is ready to pop the right for n 0 to return def return def if return return

my opinion exception handling is not something generally acceptable for embedded gcc nor microsoft have exception both compilers insert prologue and epilogue statements into each function that track the scope of this leads to a measurable increase in performance and memory performance difference is something like in my which for my area of work is a huge the memory overhead was far less but still significant i remember the figure but with easy to compile your program both ways and measure the seen some people talk about exception handling as an if you use based on what observed this just when you enable exception handling it affects all whether a code path can throw exceptions or not makes total sense when you consider how a compiler would also stay away from rtti for embedded although we do use it in debug builds to sanity check downcasting

not specific to new programming the book open source by karl fogel to read may be contain some hints to the issue of making a community around your new programming terms of adoption of programming languages in it seems like the trend lately has been to have a rich library to make development times there much detail on what your language is hard to determine whether adoption of the language is going to depend on the availability of a rich perhaps your language will be able to fill a niche that has been overlooked by other languages and be able to gain or perhaps it has a slick name that will draw people in there are many factors which can affect the adoption of a are some factors that come to mind when thinking about recent successful to leverage existing libraries in the new an adapter to external libraries written in other allows access to code written in c through the a platform which already has plenty of libraries available for and target the java therefore allowing the use of and interoperation between existing java design and syntax to allow increased languages have gained such as and python to name a concise and clear code can be written in languages such as as opposed to verbose languages such as features such as as and which offered in more languages such as c and community of dedicated users who also are willing to teach newcomers on the benefits of a human factor is going to be big in support for a language if people never start using your it gain more another suggestion that i could add is to make the development of your language open keep your users posted on developments in your and allow people to give you better let your users take part in the if you feel that is believe that by offering ways to participate in the bringing up of a the more people will feel that they have a stake in the success of the new so the more likely it will gain more

operating systems class going to write a scheduling simulator entitled ultimate goal is for me to have a series of cars following a set path and passengers waiting in line at a set location for those cars to return to so they can be picked up and be taken on the this will be a simple view of the track and the cars moving along i can code this easily without having to visually display anything not quite sure what the best way would be to implement a car moving along a fixed start going to simply use opengl to draw my cars as rectangles but still a little confused about how to approach updating the position and ensuring it is moving along the set path for the simulated theme i store vertices of the track in a list and have each call to move the cars a step closer to the next a car moving along a

orm some heavyweight orms can add a general drag to things but not talking orders of magnitude make orm slow is if using an orm because looks and you know how the underlying relational data model you can easily write code that seems reasonable to an oo but will murder is a handy but you need the understanding usually comes from writing sql to go with it you end up performing a looped query for each of thousands of entities at instead of a single fast then certainly it

os maintains a message where it puts the events from interrupts or other it then sends the messages from that queue to all depending on the message it send key messages to a window that have can have their own queue to process those queues are created if a message is used to create messages that are not for the message is from either a mouse or the context menu or the is translated from and of course many other messages are that message is posted to every window that should receive the os decides depending on the type of message whether a window should receive that message or most messages are waited for by the the message get posted to another window until it was processed by the this has a great impact for broadcast if one window return when handling that the queue is and other windows receive the message

people ask a question like i like to think to myself would happen if this were actually i really know what this would but i guess it would have something to do with being able to override the constructor implementation based on the dynamic type of the object being see a number of potential problems with for one the derived class will not be fully constructed at the time the virtual constructor is so there are potential issues with the what would happen in the case of multiple your virtual constructor would be called multiple times you would then need to have some way of know which one was being generally speaking at the time of the object does not have the virtual table fully this means it would require a large change to the language specification to allow for the fact that the dynamic type of the object would be known at construction this would then allow the base class constructor to maybe call other virtual functions at construction with a not fully constructed dynamic class as someone else has pointed out you can implement a kind of virtual constructor using static or type functions that basically do the same thing as a virtual constructor would

possible to create however is not about about statically based not runtime it depends if you want with methods or just with the data classes can be implemented with boost constructs like and if you want classes with you can use to bind methods to the or you can implement them on your own with a point interface like the way is to use generics so it can all be determined at for best be seen very few although i have seen that truly need runtime in most cases objects are born and die the same or at least enough to spend of their lifetime as a single class once they come out of their in many situations one finds themselves paying too much for runtime of course there is the school of thought that this provides better developer but in many each line of code will be run on hardware a few hundred million times more than the time it took to write so you can think about and runtime classes as paying up front or leasing personally i like to pay up

power of power user is basically an administrator so a user to power user does not provide any increase in security to the system you might as well be on interactively as a normal of course a developer needs administrative access to their developer machine servers and second boxes and so but of course noone should interactively log on as administrator during normal development or use a normal user account for this and most seriously do not want to run any client and so as an normally log onto your linux box as root even if you likely have root access when you need a separate personal administrator the developer with a separate personal administrator account to machine account that is also a valid administrator on other servers and boxes that person needs administrative access and in uac to prompt or request prompt and enter the administrative credentials for tasks and processes only when pki with smartcards or similar can greatly reduce the strain in entering credentials is happy audit this way and an easy way to find out who is using the terminal services sessions on a particular server you have to access right definitely development work that will never require local administrator privileges like most web development where deployment is tested against a separate server or virtual machine and where cassini or whatever is used for local debugging actually runs well as a normal

provide an abstraction layer for your domain you can therefore change the model and not break the contract you have for your service this is akin to a common practice in database design where views and procedures become the abstraction layer for the underlying data you may over expose data and send bloated messages over the this may be mitigated by using serialization but you may still have extra explicit contracts by exposing domain objects you leave it up to the client to interpret their usage since they do not have the full model at their you will often make updates to domain objects implicitly based on the presence or removal of or blindly accept all dtos explicitly express the usage of the service and the desired scenarios having explicit messages or dtos would make it easier for you to implement messaging and messaging patterns such as message pure ddd demands that domain objects are externally and therefore you must offload this to another typically a

question is similar to to concisely cascade through multiple regex statements in except instead of matching one regular expression and doing something i need to make sure i do not match a bunch of regular and if no matches are found i have valid then do i have found one way to do it but am thinking there must be a better especially if i end up with many regular i am filtering for bad stuff that occurs when i yank what looks like a valid url out of an html document but it turns out to be part of a javascript thus needs to be and thus the escaping i use beautiful soup to process these pages since they are far to mangled i use then fall back to my ugly but workable far i have found the following works relatively i compile a dict or regular expressions outside the main loop i only have to compile it but benefit from the speed increase every time i use i then loop a url through this if there is a match then the url is if not the url is pattern in match if do stuff here the obvious thought is to use regex reduces the number of compares and but makes it much harder to trouble shoot one expression per compare i can easily add a print statement matched by key is there someway to get the best of both worlds minimal number of yet still be able to print out which regex is matching the or do i simply need to bite the bullet and have my slower but easier to troubleshoot code when debugging and then squoosh all the together into one line for means one more step of programming and code maintenance and possible answer by dave so the actual code for this would look do stuff here for print matched multiple negative regex to expression in	
question very clear so going to assume that doing some kind of image processing and the results you get are values from to 1000 and now you need to save the color to a file where every value needs to be between 0 and you do this is really very dependent in the what is really the meaning of the results and what exactly you want to the two main options the values anything under 0 you replace by 0 and anything above 255 you replace by want to do this for instnace if your image processing is some kind of interpolation which really reach these normalization linearly may your minimal value to 0 and your maximal value to of course first need to find the minimum and you this does is first map the values to and then stretch them back to third option is to mix and match between these two your application might demand that you treat negative values as unneeded values and clamp them to 0 and positive values to linearly map to

read somewhere a nice rule about this that i like very it says function should throw an exception if and only if it cannot perform the task it was meant what i usually do is to decide what a function should do usually comes from business requirements or and then throw exceptions for everything you have designed your application your functions will be pretty small and perform relatively simple tasks with simple return deciding on exceptions by the above rule will not be there are always ambiguous cases with a key not found in a those should be far and but there just have to use your gut feeling on what is the more elegant and with all this never for this to work well an nice only catch exceptions that you can mostly that means you will catch them only in the upper ui levels where you can display to the user and log them or lower levels might use blocks or rethrow exceptions after some processing of their but genuine caught exceptions in low levels usually indicate bad	
read that it will only make you read this book the definitive the maven site has a lot of but the structure is terrible so need to use google to navigate in is my this by not with from the maven integration work that good not in any sure you program project is divided into modules under a common umbrella so that each module produces a single binary artifact possibly accompanied by the javadoc of the source code behind that a zip with the source code the basic principle is that each module produces a single containing all the under that you can do this while the project is still built by module should conform to the standard maven directory the build destination is under the source code is under and the artifact consists of all the code under and none of the code under as it built to the target you can do this while the is still built by by transforming the that has no dependencies on other modules in the you can create the parent maven module with artifact type consisting of one of the modules make a child module for the first submodule one with only external using the umbrella module as remember that you need to specify version for the remember to add the child module as a in the parent always use as version in the child modules when you create projects like all modules under a parent must be released simultaneously in a single and if you use this setting maven will make sure the version fields stay the same across all modules and gets updated everywhere during the this may make it difficult to the existing numbering but that you are never going to run out of version numbers the necessary and make sure you can build the parent and the child module together using the command clean from the parent with the rest of the modules the same dependencies to other modules under the same parent project should also use as the they are depending meaning same version as note that in order to the module you are depending on must be built using so that it gets deployed to you local otherwise the depending module will not be able to find the there are no dependencies between modules in only dependencies to built and packed versions installed in local and remote this can be very confusing if you come from build from the root module until you get comfortable with it takes two use maven integration in it is a bad use or to set up your workspace as a ordinary ide the dependencies mechanisms in maven and the ide identical and will never if you have several mavenized projects with dependencies in you want to have several of these in your workspace with dependencies set up you can do this with mvn if you create a separate maven project file called in the same directory as parent set up as a project containing modules and reference no parent ref if you run you get a workspace with all these modules linked no ide integration lets you do this sound like a lot of extra but the is really it have to contain all that dependency stuff and all only the reference to the modules you want to bind together in your

run a run a start an executable is any file with executable you just specify it by its make a script give it the necessary a file is the is responsible for figuring out how to execte for this is done by looking at the first line of the it should contain a hashbang tells the kernel what program to run this case the command is ran with the argument the script is passed to the program second along with all the arguments you gave the script as subsequent means script that is executable should have a if it not telling the kernel what it and therefore the kernel know what program to use to interprete it could be or something the kernel will often use the default shell to interprete the which is very dangerous because it might not be the right interpreter at all or it might be able to parse some of it but with subtle behavioural differences such as is the case between and note on see hash bangs like result is that the kernel will run the program to interpret the is not always shipped by and it is not always available in while on linux machines it usually there are a range of other posix machines where ships in various such as or write a portable bash we can therefore not rely on the location of the posix already has a mechanism for dealing with the idea is that you install your programs in one of the directories that are in and the system should be able to find your program when you want to run it by you just do kernel do a search for there is a program that can do a search for called nearly all systems have an program installed in so we start using a hardcoded which then does a search for and runs it so that it can interpret your approach has one according to the hashbang can have in this we use as the argument to the that means we have no space left to pass arguments to so no way to convert something like to this have to put after the hashbang approach also has another some systems may ship with a but the user may not like may find buggy or and may have installed his own somewhere this is often the case on os x where apple ships an outdated and users install an using something like when you use the approach which does a you take the preference into account and use his preferred bash over the one his system shipped

some limited a hash map could but you need to think how going to purge cached images from memory when the cache gets you define that probably some maximum amount of memory that you want to devote to how going to deal with how going to deal with the case where client a requests an and then client b requests the same image while it is still being loaded into the cache for client very simple solution to could be to always store softreferences to the image data and let the jvm take care of deciding when to purge them in mind it could arbitrarily purge them at times beyond your you need to develop some kind of policy image accessed longest image image that will take longest to decode if we have to load it again only you know your data and so you have to find the right will generally help you you may decide to use explicit locks and other concurrency utilities in fancier a fairly elegant solution proposed by goetz et al is to hijack the future in your you store a future to the cached object to your if a requester finds that a future has already been added to the then it can call and wait for the other thread to finish caching the could achieve a similar effect with an explicit lock and but future takes some of the work out for i agree with the poster who said you probably want to store the images in their original coded but from your code assuming that was probably what you were intending all

there is that is often overlooked and can come bite you in the there is some it always even when there is no code otherwise called in your unit the is always while think it removing a unit that you need in your project can make a notable thing worth noting is that order of the units determines which identifier the compiler when there are in 2 different units and you call them without prefixing with the unit name you should always do as a best than as mason and rob pointed the units order impacts the order in which they are compiled and the sequence of the for the code it will be faster if you remove unnecessary but also globally if all your units used in the project are explicitly added to the dpr instead of relying on the search path to find them when they are implicitely added through another

there too many if not the case but say less than you could create indexes for all would increase speed significantly and indexes take much you plan to make a huge table of then i bet your approach is ok provided you index all	
theres not a whole lot of difference there is very little one can do that the other but the configs tend to differ most obvious difference is that oracle uses sequences and sql server uses there are pros and cons to some prefer one over the my experience doing top n queries in sql server seems a little easier than of the box oracle uses mvcc data is to reads by other database maintains a consistent sql server i only discovered recently has this too but not the default option and is called something quite transaction isolation level or and are reasonably different in syntax in some areas but the concepts are mostly the i found sql server management studio to be ok but horrendous in some like its data just work with auto increment primary this was a known bug going back years on sql server i know if fixed it in 2008 or with developer ship as part of a separate commercial imports and exports were a has an annoying limit on limited to 4k in much longer in sql server found the sql server security model just tcp was disabled by default authentication and then you had to setup a logon and a i never quite got it just seemed to be to be overly complicated whereas in oracle its user blah identified by connect to granting some other like resource is pretty never quite figured out the from the managemen recover would fail saying someone was connected to the database but that someone was me attempting to run the before anyone has a go at me for the i realize fully well that many of them stem from my lack of sql server experience but honestly theres still a level of consistency the and portability of concepts that is

thing that you could do is session timeout set up a timer that will expire shortly before your actual session have the timer a dialog indicating that the session is about to expire and let the user have the opportunity to renew it back an ajax request to refresh the session have another timer on the dialog that will expire before the time remaining on the actual session runs if this timer then reset the href of the page to the logout url and log the user the timers will need to be reset by user activity on the page ajax

things to the handshake consume more than 13 leaving less than four for the the integer you want to read written via you flush the stream from the i took a look at the java sources have the sources on my not sure which version and the problem might be in is just calling four is calling if its buffer is exhausted if its first read only got 16 calls the underlying which by contract might not actually read if this will return an erroneous is all assuming that reading all of this which might not be the i only took a quick peek at the suspect that your bufferedinputstream is only getting the first 16 bytes of the stream in its first be curious what your returns right before the if not suggest you flush your outputstream after writing the int you read as a possible	
things unlisted is okay if the attendees generally trust the agreed changes to be and tend to agree what the agreement on each issue in the first light approach could be to mark each case as notified but no action from the author be and so this would mean all attendees also are in sync about what really is going to be done on a single too much is sure to make code reviews tedious and which way is best would also have to do with the kind of the project something and whether the people work in the same company or if a subcontracting review money will be paid it	
think a few thousand records should put any strain on your even my laptop should handle it your biggest concern gigantic tables if you do any cleanup or avoid premature optimization on that for your make sure you do each user in a separate if make sure using innodb to avoid unnecessary if already using database that supports transactions you might see a significant performance using copy least on postgres unsure about sure your table is properly indexed removing unused indexes hurt insert to	
think all putting it before or after matter except against a very specific threat fact that there is supposed to defeat rainbow threat model i alluded to would be the scenario where the adversary have rainbow tables of common salts to the the guessing they either have it appended or prepended but not and a poor be better to assume that they have the capacity to store these rainbow but tables with strange salts interspersed in the middle of the in narrow i would conjecture that interspersed would be i pick a different salt per a long and include odd characters in it like symbols and ascii

think my question is best described as an say i have a simple model called and it has a few attributes that are simple data something the db table will contain three columns with those three attributes and i can access them with something like or the problem trying to solve is what happens when or can no longer be contained in a simple data assume that foo and goo represent the same type of that they are both instances of just with different so now thing might look like now there is a new model called that looks like far this is all now here is where if i have how can i set it up to refer to my 2 instances of whazit by name the the is that any thing will always have exactly 2 that i need to know if the whazit i have is basically foo or i do in the current but that is initial thought is to add a attribute to whazit so i can get the whatzits associated with my and then choose the whazit i want by name that that seems ugly there a better practices for multiple associations with the same class in

think that the best approach is to go to the official java and skim it and just stop at everything that looks unfamiliar and read more most tutorials are aimed at people who never developed but imho the sun one is fairly useful even for people who do understand would also recommend reading a tutorial or a difference for short summary of differences with code think that eclipse is a good ide and should be straightforward to a word of if you decide to use a book on make sure that it is updated to java 5 and in the early days java missed support for generics and that made everything incredibly special attention to the tutorial chapters about the collections framework and the java threading wait with the other apis guis with also be aware that the java library is somewhat as you you may want to take a look at the apache commons project for many things that the main library is

think that you need to step back and think about what a or associative really all it is is a way to store a value for a given and get that value back quickly and you may also want to be able to iterate over the keys to retrieve every key value or delete keys and their associated think about a data structure you use all the time in shell and even just in the shell without writing a that has these the all you need to have an associative array in shell programming is a temp is your associative array you feel like using and you can always write some little these ones are modelled off of though they just output the value rather than setting arbitrary variables like 3 exit mkdir echo 2 exit cat own this approach is actually quite a bit faster than the linear search using sed suggested by the as well as more robust allows keys and values to contain qnd the fact that it uses the filesystem does not make it these files are actually never guaranteed to be written to the disk unless you call for temporary files like this with a short not unlikely that many of them will never be written to did a few benchmarks of modification of and my using the following driver fix broken stack overflow syntax i 0 i 1 for j 0 j 1 put get time irfan 10 real user sys time brian 10 real user sys time jerry 10 real user sys time irfan 100 real user sys time brian 100 real user sys time jerry 100 real user sys time irfan 10 real user sys time brian 10 real user sys time jerry 10 real user sys time irfan 1000 real user sys time brian 1000 real user sys time jerry 1000 real user sys	
think the best way is to use and pipe in the found that this what is happening here is that going through the valid files one by then copying them to the new the statement at the end is so that the directories are also kept when copying over the that part takes the destination directory and joins it with the directory after the source got the idea from and then modified it a bit to make it work for this hope it

think the general consensus on the current windows workflow is that the product is not quite ready for primetime if you want to get anything more than trivial accomplished with the current you will likely have to write a few custom tasks to fill in functionality also had issues with the designer flaking out when the complexity of the workflow starts piling what been about windows the next version is a complete rewrite that fixes a lot of the issues in the current they claim backward compatibility with but you probably will have to know the framework pretty well to know what changed and how to fix it if it work right you have a project that absolutely demands this functionality probably better off waiting until the new bits	
think the idea is that you use it to generate and then it to your specific think there is no problem using the code out of the generator if it does what you want as long as you remember what it all does from a security point of view leave in actions if you want your interface to allow thing i to avoid lots of duplicate generated is the plug in it abstracts the duplicate default code and lets you override it as	
think the main difference is authentication means that the identity is handled as part of the windows handashaking and now password is ever for authentication means that you have to store a username and a password yourself making it much easier to a heap of effort has gone into making windows authentication very robust and i suggest that if you do implement windows authentication use groups and roles to do groups in windows and roles in having to setup lots of users in sql is a big pain when you can just setup the group and then add each user to the think most security should be done this way

think the problem is the app get anywhere near pegging my but the frame rate still appear would look at two how calculating your position and how often firing the event to do 100 frames per choose 30fps instead other refresh on your or you should attempt to do your updates in sync with your like a video game 30 alone probably solve the you also assume that the time between events is elapsed you are firing a timer to do that update every that mean actually getting done in a consistent amount of garbage os whatever can affect the amount of time it actually measure the elapsed time since the last update was actually and do your calculation based on that

think working in a sandbox is a good it has saved me a few i usually have a few different virtual machines floating around that i use for development and if i mess it up real bad i have to wait for my machine to be think all test results from simple developer builds should be made not really worried about hurting feelings by having all their failures public necessarily but i worry that the information they provide would be interesting to investigate some type of system whereby the developer is required to submit passing test results when they checkin but i think even that would be pushing it may have the detrimental effect of hurting developers have enough stuff to do

think you only need a single and an appropriate widget class that contains references to the other it might help to make it a custom dictionary so that you can simply add a widget and have it derive the key from the filepath public class widgetdictionary provide suitable constructors public void widget widget if null widget public class public string filepath private widgets new public get return to widgets from to do you simply look the widget up in the widget repository by file var repository new string filepath var widget do you can remove and the widget to the repository after changing file references to the widget held by other widgets will still be widget this could probably be implemented as a method on dictionary as public void widget string newpath if throw new var widget if widget do simply reference the filepath you want to automatically have other widgets remove their references to a widget when it is deleted probably want to have the widget class implement idisposable and have the ability to add event handlers to a dispose event so that interested widgets can register a method that will remove the widget being disposed from their collection of related see msdn on how to set up and use event

this varies by and my example is overly it basically comes down to heap managers having linked lists that could be and you can use the linked list pointers to overwrite random parts of the i have a naive heap implementation whose control blocks are like int actual heap buffer follows this the heap gets this control block goes back into a list of freed by modifying the if i overrun a heap i can overwrite the pointers in the next control block with data i suppose i override these links to point to a pointer to code just in the buffer i and to the return address of the function on the when the heap manager tries to link the block back into a freed it will actually overwrite the return address on the stack with a pointer to code i article has a nice overview on heap overflow article describes some of the hardening that went into heap manager to prevent this sort of on possibility to run code from yes many platforms now make heap memory by default which raises the barrier to getting arbitrary code to you can still do a to style attack overwrite the return address to a known function which will be

thought i really understood and the standard just confirms my obviously wrong so now i ask following program struct int struct int char this line return the expressions and according to my interpretation of the array definition of the operator is that identical to this has type to and the value is the start address of therefore evaluates to an integer object whose storage is at the same address that and function when it is the operand of sizeof operator or the unary an lvalue that type of is converted an expression with type that points to the element of the array object and is an has type of and is as described above converted to to with the address of the first element as therefore evaluates to an integer object whose storage is at the same address that the first element in the structure and union pointer to a structure suitably points to initial member and vice there may be unnamed padding within structure but not at as necessary to achieve appropriate the first member of is the the start address and the whole object is the same as described understanding were therefore that evaluates integer whose storage is at the same address that the in the array and thus is identical to this cannot be the because the program crashes cygwin and linux with gcc versions so any environmental issue is completely out of the is my reasoning do i not do i declare to make ptr point to the first member of the vs array in

traditionally serial numbers are serial so the first example off the production line has sn 0001 then the next one is 0002 and the next one is i think that most people can work out that think actually asking about product which use a similar mechanism to public key message signing the product key is the encrypted the program has a public key which allows it to verify that the key is but only the software vendor has the secret key to the product the wikipedia article on has the general the only proviso is that for a key to be entered by the user it has to be quite a bit shorter than a pgp you are restricted to a very short serial then unlikely to be big enough to store the result of a typical signing in which case quite common to just use some variant of checksum on that has the disadvantage of being easy to reverse engineer security is because the algorithm is rather than due to any cryptographic each product would have its own and they usually get cracked quite you have 5 blocks of 5 you have which is bigger than so could use one of the standard digital signature algorithms which generates a 128 then convert that value to base

typical problem of this approach is that the file is still being copied while the event is you will get an exception because the file is locked during an exception is especially likely on large a workaround you could first copy the file and then rename it and listen to the renaming another option would be to have a while loop checking whether the file can be opened with write if it can you will know that copying has been code could look like this a production system you might want to have a maximum number of retries or timeout instead of a waits until a file can be opened with write static void while using stream if file catch file not yet ready catch file not yet ready catch file not yet ready another approach would be to place a small trigger file in the folder after copying is your filesystemwatcher would listen to the trigger file

users are involved mostly when there is no there is only the illusion of not a lot you can do about you could have security questions but even they are prone to exploitation since some people put everything out in the public channels like email offer a reasonable solution to the if the user requests a password reset you can email them a password reset still not as others have but exploiting this would require the attacker to be somewhere in the line of sight between the its mta and the users technically easy but i suggest that the reality is just too much for them to bother on anyone except very high profile the user to supply ssl or gpg public keys at account creation time will help but clueless users know what those things are be able to keep their private keys secure and backed up so they lose the user to supply a second emergency password of like on mobile phone sim could help but likely the user would use the same password twice or forget the second password unless you want to educate your users on security and then hit them with a cluestick until they realise that it is necessary to be secure and the slight amount of extra work is not simply there to be a pain in the

was a good blog written on this topic java objects stored in	
was initially going to say that i like when developers declare methods private as it needlessly places limits on anyone who would like to use their most developers would rather write their own class than attempt to use a class that is hard to use adapt to their which is what you would think a private method would but then i realized that it is really sealed classes that are more likely to cause this i gave it some thought and having a hard time thinking of good uses for protected methods than for something like the template so i looked at code from some old projects and i see if i create a method it is because simplifying a public method by creating helper i certainly want anyone to be able to change the helper method as that will almost certainly break my public be interested in knowing if there was a specific example that brought this topic up that we could or maybe someone has a good example is not the template of a good use of protected

was wondering if any of you had successfully implemented ddd in a app and would like to share some are currently working on a smart client in flex and a backend in on the server we have a service layer exposed to the client that offers crud operations amongst some other service i understand that in ddd these services should be repositories and services should be used to handle use cases that do not fit inside a right we mimic these services on the client behind an interface and inject implementations via an ioc some questions the server expose repositories to the client or do we need to have some sort of a facade is able to handle security for the client implement repositories ddd in knowing that in the most of the logic is view related and real business logic lives on the all communication with the server happens asynchronously and we have a single threaded programming model on the about mapping client to server objects and vice we tried but reverted back to exposing the state of our objects and mapping directly to i know this is considered bad but it saves us an incredible amount of general i think a new generation of applications is coming with the growth of javafx and curious how ddd fits into and

way to look at this concept is that the state is represented by the current page and the links embedded in traversing a link changes the state of the application which is represented by the next it is a little hard to the links that are available at any point in time define what actions are available based on the actions that have already this is one definition of current trick is to represent the available actions are uris which on a retrieving the representation associated with a uri implicitly performs the action and retrieves the representation that uris are embedded in the representation and the user understands the action associated with a specific the various http methods help define the that occur and specifies when no action is this is usually what people are getting at when describing the whole restful

we have been adding automated tests to our existing java we majority of these tests are integration which may cover a stack of calls post into a servlet validates the request and calls the business business layer does a bunch of stuff via hibernate etc and updates some database servlet generates some runs this through xslt to produce response then verify that the servlet responded with the correct xml and that the correct rows exist in the database development oracle these rows are then also have a few smaller unit tests which check single method tests are all run as part of our nightly seems good because we are checking the boundaries of our servlet on one end and database on the if these then we are free to refactor or mess with anything inbetween and have some confidence that the servlet under test continues to problems are we likely to run into with this see how adding a bunch more unit tests on individual classes would that make it harder to refactor as much more likely we will need to throw away and are the pros and cons of automated unit tests vs automated integration

well known that bayesian classifiers are an effective way to filter these can be fairly concise one is only a few hundred but all core code needs to be written before you get any results at the tdd approach mandates that only the minimum amount of code to pass a test can be so given the following method the following string of which is clearly generic minimum amount of code i could write return text generic maybe i add another test viagra could change the code return so and so until at some point the code becomes a mess of string regular because it instead of thinking about it and writing it in a different way from the how is tdd supposed to work with this type of situation where evolving the code from the simplest possible code to pass the test is not the right if it is known in advance that the best implementations cannot be trivially and the bayesian spam filter

what most of the answers so far the meaning is exactly the same as in any two expressions a and b evaluating to a b and a b do almost the same b evaluates a and and if one of them evaluates to the result is b does almost the same except it evaluates a and then only evaluates b if it is since the entire expression is true if either a or b is b need to be tested at all if a is so and skips evaluating the second operand when where the operator will always evaluate operator often and often it make a the only common case i can think of where make a difference is foo null assuming returns a works because the member function is never called if the left test that if foo is we call dostuff on would give us a used the would be called regardless of whether foo was null or only the operator is and is a bitwise as the other answers the operator defined for integer types so hard to get them mixed up in

would like a page that displays a list of nodes can do this part with the views and then also displays the details of a single node below the ideally the details will update via ajax when a node in the list is but reloading the page would be fine for a just starting to get into drupal and the number of levels at which i can do stuff is somewhat for example should this be a view page with a customised block at the a page with two blocks for the list one for the if so how would they communicate the node is there already a module that will do this for maybe i should write my own and so if anyone with a better general understanding of drupal could point me in the right direction it would be for the answers so i think they point out that i missed out an important detail in my original question some more would like this page to effectively be a home as such my view is restricted to showing nodes that editing the default node page would give me the problem of which node to send the user to when they log in may be possible i and also would mean that i presumably view the node without also seeing the have been trying another tack which is to create page node which includes the view using some i have also set the view control to create a link for each node in the list and include the node id in that link 13 is the node id of the page i have created and 12 is the node id of the item in the the find the second print this but sure a more drupal way of doing things the query string parsing is a nasty to display a list of nodes and details of a single node in	
would like some feedback on how we can best write a generic function that will enable two lists to be the lists contain class objects and we would like to iterate through one looking for the same item in a second list and report any already have a method to compare so we need feedback on how we can feed the method from two say we have a simple class that has three we want to report the differences between list and another lists will always contain the same number of mentioned we have a generic method that we use to compare two how can we incorporate this method to cater for from another loop through the list and feed the classes to the generic method but how do we find the equivalent class in the second list to pass to the method static string t2 where t1 where t2 instantiate if if throw new class must first be var differences loop through each property in the destination foreach destprop in find the matching property in the orig class and foreach origprop in if if differences differences return suggestions or ideas targeting so linq is out of the two lists for	
would like to authenticate username and passwords for my application on a windows operating system with any directory for example it could be microsoft active novell or i already know how to do this code natively for microsoft active direcotry with i totally gave up using adsi and creating a low level com way im attempting to authenticate with novel edirecotory is i have installed the mono inside the mono project they provide you with the code looks somewhat the same as for microsoft active i have been told to use the same code as active but the ldap connecton string is a little complicate my most customers use a which means i need to bind with an administrative username and password before i can authenticate a regular username and my questions is in 2 from what i have explained is this the correct direction i should be going to authenticate against each individual direcotory i feel that i dont not need to do any of this code at i also feel the stipulation of using a service account is not imporant at if all i care about is authenticating a username and password on a windows machine why do i even need to use i mean think about when you login to your machine in the you do not have to provide a service account just to i can easily authenticate a username and password at a dos prompt by using the runas feature and i will be denied or not and could parse the text im sure there are other ways i could pass a username and password to the windows operating system that i am on and will tell me if a username and password is valid for the domain that it is am i if so what suggested ways do you guys to authenticate ldap in

would need to know more that what the class does and what the parameters but there is a possibility that the class has too many would it be possible to split the class to smaller independent setters does not solve the problem of the class having many it just moves the problem to a different place and does not force the parameters being i try to follow the advice from the clean code book to have no more than 3 parameters per method for constructors i may have more because typically the constructor will be called by my dependency injection framework and not by builder pattern mentioned by mmyers is also a good solution when building complex and there is no way to make them less	
would probably split them out into multiple features so that you can updat ethem seperately if need you could always create a parent feature which has activationdependencies on the child if you mark the child features the parent feature will automatically activate the child features and they clutter up your features	
would provide a neat solution to your depending on the user ask the user to fill more from your problem statement its looking that you know how many projects need extra fields and which do if you know this data then feed this data into a database and then accordingly generate your form however even if the data is available dynamically with the use of an interactive javascript and ajax you can easily achieve a neat	
would quite like the system to be quite easy to define new already have such a it is your in check constraints serve to prevent invalid data from being entered at a case like your example where you want to allow the value but flag it write a and have a client application issue an error if the view has any an view as select from table where 50 the raise an error from return you established a convention that all such views were named with a your client could select all such view names from the systables for the database in one then iterate that list by calling from logging an error for any that returned more than zero this would be adding a new error report would consist of nothing more than creating a view with the proper name not have to recompile the additional advantage is that adding any rule engine would require learning its domain specific language for writing training new staff on and even then inevitably there would be corner cases the rules easily your coders already know and based on a 17 year old ansi standard based on 20 earler years of so most of the corner cases have been ironed out of the	
would recommend a package management application for installed you should be able to go to a command window and may require putting on your path i remember if the easyinstall setup does this for you like	
would recommend doing asynchronous a little bit easier to set up and require you to create new threads programming is where you for a file stream you want to write to but does not want to wait for it to you might want to be notified when finished but you want to you do is using the and functions that are available on the stream your method you start by calling beginwrite with all the data you want to write and also pass in a callback this function will be called when beginwrite has the callback function you call endwrite and clean up the stream and check for will not block which means that if called from within an event handler that thread can finish that handler and continue processing more event as other gui private static filestream static void stream new const string mystring asciiencoding encoding new data sleeping 5 public static void sleeping is pretty important because the thread writing stuff will be killed if the main thread is killed this is not an issue in a gui only here in this small has a good on how to write this and also some on asynch programming in general in case you go for the or

would rethink your design you implemented the processing in a base you could subclass it with 2 alternatives that would be nearly first could be like where it takes an operation that returns a would rework this to use instead of having your own delegate second could just take a simple action and not provide a return both could use the same but provide a different way of you could also pass this off to other methods using the base which would provide a lot of this you could call this void int return var actionwindow new var funcwindow new int result would look something abstract partial class operatingwindowbase public void call asyncronously so you can protected abstract void class public t result private public protected override class action public protected override	
would say it depends on what exactly you are trying to afraid you cannot avoid a post unless they support some query string variable or have a way of setting a in a cookie or that have to figure out by a standard you will have to mimic user actions in some form and which means sending initial get request to extract all form field and then creating a post to simulate the post this inside a regular browser would be i i remember if javascript allows to set headers and i guess you could use ms active if your goal is to extract data in some you can do it relatively are plenty of samples on how to use httpwebrequest or webclient for screen including simulating logins and i would use send a get get preserve extract form create a post recreate headers proper form proper post reassign and you should be see what needs to be i suggest using a fiddler run then browse to the click on a the filder will show you all traffic and all necessary information on both the initial request and subsequential post	
would say it looks blurry kind of like as if you were viewing this on osx or i too agree that this is unacceptable together with of where font rendering is awful as while microsoft keeps on promising to fix this for 4 fact many of us need to stuff which leads to the following can ignore common sense and just ship the software making fonts bigger and what have so long as your customer the my you are working with you can wait until some future release until this is fixed for good look at how long wpf has been everyone knew about this problem guess what it been you are working with you get the perfect font rendering an algorithm that is even marginally better than what vista does face is same goes for the algorithm for an ideal cleartype is a mixture of judicious use of subpixel antialiasing and using font hinting i have done and have even had fun optimizing it for simd and the it a serious investment of your i tried this but it should oh if you want to kill the go having said i think provided you know taking advantage of hardware guess what trying to say is there a solution for winforms the best algorithm but there a solution for i wish someone would prove me	
would say the biggest danger is if the parameter were set to inside the function for some void customer random person not just a been erased from existence long as whoever is developing this application understands object references are passed by the object references are passed by the code works as expected now and your developers understand the probably not worth the effort going to take remove them

would second the notion that you may wish to consider a subclass instead of the approach not knowing your specific ymmv thinking of is a the function in a metaclass is passed the full proposed definition of the which it can then rewrite before the class is you at that sub out the constructor for a new def return def the constructor is perhaps a bit but the language does provide support for this kind of deep introspection and dynamic	
would think there would be some way to programatically detect if the object being acted on is a thus you could wrap your custom tbo logic in an if check for and if it is a template none of your logic would be general not considered good practice to have heavy amounts of logic in your as run regardless of context and you often run into situations such as which you want to it is better to put this type of logic in an sbo and call the sbo from the context where you want this logic to be ie by extending	
would use a solution similar to the used for widgets in the application that would allow you to put all the relevant properties into something akin to or that you could assign each language version to a native speaker expert to ensure that your grammar are a separate want to run each version to ensure that button names and other properties that may be clipped actually fit within the appropriate if need to either do some abbreviation or redesign to allow for larger smaller	
would use files with to widgets begruessen sie zu widgets your setup you detect the locale and require else if require gives you the benefit of constants and makes localization reasonably transparent to your application in that you have to do all over the if anything is just put it in the locale you want to add a locale file just copy an existing one and change all the references rather than trawling your codebase for can also put code in these files like correctly formatting numbers and dates for these locales the right names in each language but also the use of periods and so currency conversions and

writing a dsp application in a multitrack been profiling it for quite some time on different machines and noticed some my home the first run of the playback loop takes up about of the available assume due to the jit doing its then for the subsequent loops it goes down to a steady the problem if i run the application on a slower the first run takes up more than the available causing the playback to get interrupted and messing the output which is after it goes down to a after the first the application keeps calling some routines from time to time 2 seconds more or which causes the steady consumption to experience very short peaks of noticed that if i let the application run for a while these peaks will also go down to a not sure if due to the jit recompiling these portions of i have a serious problem with the while the application will behave nicely even in very slow these are going to be a big trying to figure out how to resolve this issue and come up with an which is to mark all the routines with an attribute that will tell the application to them beforehand during so be fully optimized when really but this is only an idea i like it too much and i wonder if a better solution to the whole like to hear what you guys the application is not an i like and want all the jit optimizations i can consumption and garbage collection kicks are not an using object pools and the maximum peak of memory during playback is 304 the jit compiler to generate the most optimized code during application

writing the entire then your reasons are your i can think of a few situations where you want to throw the exception and let the app most of them are not very good reasons best reason is usually when i frequently disable exceptions while debugging to allow me to know better where something is you can also just turn on thrown exception breaks in the debugger if running it on a machine with the possible reason is when continuing after an exception is thrown make sense or would result in possible irrecoverable data corruption or worse robots with laser but then you should be damn sure your applicaiton deals with these situations crashing the program is just the lazy writing api or framework code that you use then you have no idea if someone will catch your

you can change the signature of your then try changing it const char const int int will result in a more reusable and more efficient added const qualifiers will make sure you mistakenly alter the input this function is a so i assume it is never meant to have suffix to compare against is passed in as a so you can save this function for later reuse with other signature will give you the opportunity to pass the lengths of the strings in if you already know we call this can define the function like const char const int int str suffix return str suffix return lenstr 0 lenstr lensuf 0 lensuf return lenstr obvious for the extra parameters is that they imply more noise in the or a less expressive

you just want to give a different name to the association just use the property page for the association and rename the parent child that will change the name of the in the the downside of using a separate property in a partial class is that linq be able to use it when generating queries essentially be forced to always get the entities before you can use the related properties on the by renaming you allow linq to use the related properties in constructing the query which can result in a more efficient for if you want to get entities where a related entity has a particular property using the attribute decorated entity will allow linq to generate the sql to pull just those matching values from the with the naive property implementation simply references the underlying relation in effect renaming you will be forced to first get all then do the filtering in your

you know the width in then your only possible answer would depend on staging your output in a temporary buffer of some for small just collecting the data and deferring output until the input is bounded would be large an intermediate file may be required if the collected data exceeds reasonable memory you have the then it is simple to it into a report using the idiom for each if the output channel permits random you could just go ahead and write a draft of the report that assumes a default and seek back and edit it any time your width assumption is this also assumes that you can pad the report lines outside that field in some innocuous or that you are willing to replace the output so far by a process and abandon the draft unless you can predict the correct width in it will not be possible to do what you want without some form of

you wish to use you could use will give you a number between 0 and 100 that represents the percentage of physical memory in use and totalphys will tell you total total amount of physical memory in is tricky because usable memory is a blend of physical and virtual the specific and what goes is determined by the operating this is somewhat configurable as windows allows you to stipulate how much virtual memory to if note that not all of the memory in windows is available for windows may report up to 4gb installed but only is available for actual use by the operating system and this has to do with legacy addressing issues	
you you can overload the function to take either pointers or but i would resist doing so on the grounds of mere convenience and stick witn one function this is how all the major libraries argument type to use in that it depends my personal a null object can make sense use the common use case is that the objects being passed are normally created use the implementation uses pointers use use	
you you can use a lock to make sure that no other threads will enter sensitive pieces of code to do with your but for the generally not and would be slightly strange in a operating system on a relatively it may be possible in driver but not usually needed in user that threads necessarily mean a context switch given and despite your i still see why a problem for there to be a context if the thread has to block pretty much to context switch to a different i agree a slightly annoyance that you have to wait for 100ms or so to be confident that your test will have let everything happen on the other thread that you but you definitely need to ensure that it

your i would rather do something return an invalid handle in case of failure and a valid handle of i am assuming that the handle type is someway similar to what win32 api uses as for your pass output parameters by reference or by so the second you should make sure that the passed pointer is not usually with an null rest of the disadvantage of passing the output parameters as pointers is that you know for sure if the passed pointer is valid or not initialized or by reference is sometimes less readable when it comes to output result give a hint to the developer that myhandle is an output and some subtle problems may occur due to code i recomend to avoid as much as possible output because of the code if you really have no use references instead if the output parameter is

your looking for a project that templates a rest correct in saying there is no out of the box restful web services are possible using the key part is to use several attributes when defining your service functions that let the framework know that the function is not expecting the main attribute to use is the is an example from uritemplate post above code will actually be defined in an interface for your web the interface is created automatically when you create your wcf web service the actual code for the function will be placed in the class used to implement the web out the article on for a full it might seem overwhelming at first if your new to but after you dive into sure start to pick things up here is the link for the answer all of your in you should be able to build restful services using but if you have the option to use i would strongly recommend going the route of wcf since it is much easier and is designed with rest in converting your project be hard at just a matter of targetting the new version of the framework in your project converting a web service from a service to a wcf service will be a bit trickier the easiest way to do so would be to copy the code from each of the different web service functions into the class where you implement the new version of the shinanigans not sure what this starter kit is that referring restful web services should be fully supported in wcf which was fully released as of it would be helpful to understand wcf at least a little before but not crutial to understand it completely in order to get i would recommend just reading through the article on at least and then begin sure you will come across other questions as you but you can look up those parts as you come across i hope this information good luck to improvements have been made in the rest as darrel miller mentioned in the wcf was not in fact built with rest in i in fact the framework is built with soap in mind and the webinvoke attribute fills the although there is a lot of debate around the topic api vs wcf web api is a new option for building rest services in i would strongly recommend that anyone who reads this post and is able to use in their project look into it as an

your user authentication is somehow session then the answer to all your cases will actually be the norm people rarely seem to log out of web will be that those user slots become free when the session times so need to investigate usage patterns of your if you get a lot of people logging on for a couple of but no more than then a 30 minute session time out would mean very few people actually get to use the fundamental problem is that web applications are inherently so you monitor what a user is actually doing between requests for a sell licences for such an application for specific users if a company buys 20 that would give them 20 user names and then you could certainly prevent multiple logons by the same user name and by either refusing the second logon or deactivating the previous one is probably the better approach in case someone has genuinely moved from one machine to another without logging off for one of the reasons you
