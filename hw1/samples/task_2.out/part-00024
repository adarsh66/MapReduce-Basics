3 seems like the cleanest api for your class to if you really use myobject until declare is to me it would make sense to wrap the new and declare into a factory to make sure that users of your class try to use myobject without first calling factory methods can also help with maintenance down the way to help with testability might be to wrap the declare operation in a pluggable interface in the your production app would use an implementation of ideclarer that calls the com while your test code could plug in a mock maybe something like this probably have to tweak public ideclarer declarer private set public static myobject com stuff with myobject newmyobject new return interface myobject class comdeclarer public myobject do com return class testdeclarer public myobject do or return

a class for the pairs of integers should be the or is this a that all arrays containing a bunch of second thing that these could be read from a as i looked again on this i realized that doubles as keys in a map is somewhat if you produce doubles as a result of an mathematical it is not if they will be equal for the computer if they are equal in a mathematical are represented as approximation in most likely you want to associate the values with the interval and not the value you may avoid if you always use the same constants as keys in the but in this case you could use an enum as and no new programmer runs into if he uses his calculated doubles as keys in the	
a class has a constructor which throws a meaningful error message when construction fails when the score is outside a valid what do you think of that worries me a because calling a ctor requires memory which is relatively for each row calling a ctor and only for its expensive are great when you need but this is a case where you vould use them in a ctor but not in a check refactoring could reduce both by having the check exist as a class static or free then both the check constraint and the ctor could call score int static bool int score return score 0 int s s throw score constraint calls no construction or exception you still have the for each of a clr whether acceptable is something have to there a statement to with check all check constraints on all or do i have to them table by but you can do this to generate the table name with check check constraint from then run the resultset against the from the use base classes called constrainednumber and regexconstrainedstring for all my data i could easily move those two simple constructor code to a separate public boolean isvaluevalid method as you and probably clr overhead memory would only occur for inserts and given the simplicity of the and rate at which table updates will i think the performance impact will anything to worry about for my still really want to raise exceptions for the information provide to management studio i like the isvaluevalid because it gives me the of not throwing within applications using my data i could still get the exception by constructing an instance not sure i agree with the exception but the is that by decomposing the problem into you can select what parts wiling to pay without paying for parts you the ctor you because you were only calling it to get the so we decomposed creation and we can further decompose score int static bool int score return score 0 static int score s throw int s s score a user can call the and get the check and possible exception and call checkvalid and get the check and or isvalid to just get the paying the runtime cost for only what he

a common mistake to think of as a functional really it is best thought of as a family of but these days when people say lisp they usually mean common lisp allows functional but it a functional language per rather it is a general purpose scheme is a much smaller that is more functional in and of course there are for your question is it a good that really depends on your common lisp particularly has some real strengths for this sort of both interactive and introspective at a level you usually see in scripting making it very quick to develop at the same time its compiled and has efficient so you can expect performance in the same ballpark as other efficient compilers a factor of two of c is typical while a large it has a much more consistent design than things like and the metaprogramming capabilities can make very easy to understand code for your particular if you only look at these lisp looks there are the community is you find many people to help if what looking while the built in library is you find as many 3rd party so you may end up writing more of it from while by no means a walled cl have the kind of smooth integration with foreign libraries that say python which mean you call c there are nice tools for they clos is about the most powerful oo system i can think but it is quite a different approach if coming from a mainstream oo background they but beyond single multiple not that you may find it a bit strange at almost turned inside you go this you are going to have to watch for some issues with performance of the actual rendering if you write that yourself with the class system has incredible runtime flexibility updating class definitions at runtime not via monkey patching but via actually changing the class and updating however you pay some dispatch cost on what used cl in the past for research code requiring numerical simulations of a different it works well for in that case i worried about using existing code it so i was writing pretty much everything from scratch it could be a fine choice of language for this but not the only if you use a language with both aspects and good performance cl as does and a few i would definitely look at the possibility of a two level approach with a language like lua or perhaps python of on top of some c or code doing the heavy

addition to what has already been said regarding another problem salting solves you use the same salt everywhere no salt at possible to say just by looking at the database that user foo and user bar both have the same password if you know what the password if one achieve to get password social engineering for password is known as if the salt is everywhere the one can build up a dictionary dedicated to this specific and then run a attack using this	
advantage of anonymous inner classes is that no one can ever use it anywhere whereas a named inner class can be used only by the class that created it if made a small but it does mean that you can protect an inner class from being accidentally used using the anonymous inner class gives anyone reading your code a up class is being used just here and nowhere if you see a named inner someone might think be used in multiple places in the are very so neither point is a i just think it helps for clarity if you use anonymous inner classes for and named inner classes when used multiple times within the

all depends very much on the specific framework you want to broad web frameworks tend to fall into two jsp jsp spring your legacy application is it would make sense to port your application also to reducing the amount of new concepts that you your need to learn reducing the amount of code you will need to of all possible i would recommend to for view layer similar to your existing approach of using for layer quite similar to but solves quite many common issues also use with these two frameworks well with is a small example of this	
all learn so feel handicapped because of the way entered the guess the easiest thing i can suggest would be to get yourself a php book as what familiar with right and start from there to build up your spare just create some very small basic apps to practice without any then take on a language like java or depending on what takes your with a language or two under your then you can take on books like code which will cover some of the more esoteric areas of software this is a profession where you really never stop	
all of the library dictionary structures are not i have heard good things about maybe that will what you will be doing with the code i linked is creating a new type that has custom serialization methods that will allow you to serialize a dictionary to if this is the route you choose it would be best to compile this type in its own assembly so that you can share that assembly with the client of your service that way it can be used as a parameter to the service

am trying to put up the high level description of different stages in program life time from source code to its include files and compiler directive are processed in this source files are compiled into obj different obj files are linked to single at this stage the virtual addresses are assigned to data in for 32 bit each process has 4gb of address and gb is reserved of so address space in gb can be assigned to any during program execution loader comes into it basically loads the program from virtual address space to physical memory so when process starts os allocates memory for the process and call its main a program binary image size is then is it that complete binary image has to be loaded into physical memory for program my understanding is that the program has to be fully loaded in physical memory for it will not be possible to run a program of size 512mb on a machine with 256 mb of physical only when memory requirement of program grows then virtual memory and paging are program asks for more when it allocates heap memory using then memory gets reserved in virtual address it will not get committed until it is point out wherever you feel my understanding is there any article or blog that could give me a one or two page description of the whole level description of program

are in the process of doing exactly three years ago i joined the development team on a project with no unit almost no code and a fairly build code base consists of a set of com components oracle data cartridge and some java all using a core some of the code is nearly a decade first step was adding some unit the behaviour is very so there was some initial effort in generating a unit test framework now extended to other modules with junit and which uses test data from a most of the initial tests were functional tests which excercised the outermost layers and not really unit you will probably have to expend some effort you may need to budget to implement a test find it helps a lot if you make the cost of adding unit tests as low as the test framework made it relatively easy to add tests when fixing bugs in existing new code can have proper unit as you refactor and implementn new areas of code you can add proper unit tests which test much smaller areas of the last year we have added continuous integration with cruisecontrol and automated our build this adds much more incentive to keep tests and which was a big problem in the early so i would recommend that you include regular least unit test runs as part of your development have recently focussed on improving our code review which was fairly infrequent and the intent is to make it much cheaper to initiate and perform a code review so that developers are encouraged to do them more also as part of our process improvement i am trying to get time for code reviews and unit tests included in project planning at a much lower level in a way that ensures individual developers have to think more about whereas previously there was just a fixed proportion of time devoted to them that was much easier to get lost in the

at least one virtual method in a class any of its parent means that the class will have a virtual and every instance will have a virtual the memory cost is quite the most important is the memory cost on the instances if the instances are for example if they are just meant to contain an in this case having a virtual pointer in every instance might double the size of the as for the memory space used up by the virtual i guess it is usually negligible compared to the space used up by the actual method brings me to my is there a measurable performance cost speed for making a method there will be a lookup in the virtual table at upon every method so if there are very frequent calls to this and if this method is very then there might be a measurable performance i guess it depends on the but has anyone run some reason i am asking is that i came across a bug that happened to be due to a programmer forgetting to define a method this is not the first time i see this kind of and i why do we the virtual keyword when needed instead of the virtual keyword when we are absolutely sure that it is if the performance cost is i think i will simply recommend the following in my simply make method virtual by including the in every and only remove it when you need does that sound crazy to for you kind is the performance cost of having a virtual method in a

been a web developer for really quite some time but this is something never really and my progress so far has used some very complex the following is the layout i there are to this layout as i will explain in a header sidebar and the header are and so is the however you can scroll the using the css property on a container for the body section is not an the reason being is that an application which utilises the meaning that the scrollbar not a contain scrollbar is what is used to record the x and y i have achieved this but using some complex layout techniques which just my html looks like the sidebar code using and i use all of these divs for a specific so i can absolutely position borders on the content the rest of the divs actually block off content by changing the background colour of them so you see the content when you css file is far too large to be posting on but the general ul solid 0 0 as you can see from the i set a fixed make it and then set a the containing has a fixed width thus causing a when you horizontally scroll the the content will be hidden when it hits the this creates an effect much like any 10px 20px you can see that the has absolute positioning keeping it in that content anything outside of the content box is displayed even if you scroll horizontally or there better ways of doing it seems a of to be doing something really quite this layout a problem that part even difficult is maintaining simple with a complex and by i mean something unable to i have achieved the desired effect just looking for a better way of doing this is based on business i have a choice

birch has a good idea with using triggers and a you can find out more in the create trigger are you sure that you need to call an executable right away when the row is it seems like that method will be prone to because mysql might spawn multiple instances of the executable at the same if your executable then there will be no record of which rows have been processed yet and which have if mysql is waiting for your executable to then inserting rows might be very if chad birch is then will have to recompile so it sounds of calling the executable directly from i would use triggers to simply record the fact that a row got inserted or record that information in the either with new columns in your existing tables or with a brand new table called say then make an external program that regularly reads the information from the processes and marks it as specific solution will depend on what parameters the external program actually your external program needs to know which row was then your solution could be like make a new table called with fields and and for all the other make a trigger like trigger insert on each row insert into values your batch script can do something like the first row in the until is this you can have more control over when and how the data gets and you can easily check to see whether the data actually got processed check to see if the table is

blocks should only be around pieces of code that are capable of throwing exceptions involving anything involving an external those cases it is best to have only the relevant local variables something that will be these exceptions are expected and so you need to log them in a way that differentiates between expected and code you are not adding extra context to the then you are misusing your logging it is always better to catch and rethrow rather than not catch at all executes the finally but you should also add a relevant note to every logging otherwise you will actually be damaging your ability to debug the because you have no idea where the exception was thrown files are no harm in having a lot of information in them whenever you throw an the more error logging you the easier it will be to debug a production

can be called from if the type you call it on have a good implementation the default is to return the type name rather than something meaningful about the instance of that this method is inherited from the base and you can overload it in your own types to do whatever you is a not a function you should only use this if the object you need already is a string in some or if you know there is a good implicit conversion available from this will throw an exception is the object cannot be converted when the object is is another way to write but it differs in that it returns rather than throwing an exception if the cast attempts to actually the argument into a this is the best option if you really know much about the it can be slow because it has to do a lot of extra work to determine what kind of results to but that same work also makes it the most robust option when you know very much about the if nothing else is it will fall back to calling the the string method can also be used to convert certain types to with the additional advantage that you have some control over what the resulting string will look this is a little more but includes a couple different mechanisms for converting objects into a representation that can be safely stored and from disk or other streaming that includes a binary but most often involves converting to a string in some format or other serialization is appropriate when you want to later convert the your string back into originating or if you want a complete representation of a complex

co workers are if one thread locks a resource and another thread attempts to use it then your thread pool goes not very good most people resolve this by creating new objects and passing them into paramaterized if you absolutely need to use the same object then you must implement some code that first checks to see if the resource is being used by another thread and then waits a little while before checking an example would be to create a isinuse bool that you always check then your thread sets it to true if it is using that then false when it is preventing other threads from attempting to use the underlying resource i hope this

code example is not complete enough for a but take a shot at what point in the page lifecycle are you adding the button to the if doing it in that is why it is not you should be doing it during dynamically create a control after the init phase of the page lifecycle and get it to work unless you create it the same way every single this is because the lifecycle looks like load viewstate page load event handlers are creating a button and giving it an event handler during the second last this means that the button is never registered to save viewstate with the and therefore all state for that button is not restored when it is clicked meaning that your assigned event handler disappears into thin and will never be suggestion would be to create the save button normally on the page and simply set it on the click handler of your first just set your save button	
code is fine seen i would however suggest using the onclick event on the instead of relying on jquery adding functionality to your jquery does an acceptable job of you end up with code that is hard to because the end result does not display the fact that there actually is an eventhandler associated with the onclick i personally prefer to be able to see what code is actually is being using tools like firebug to examine the page being is ofc a if you are the only person to ever read your

could make a object that uses the table and go from there or you a friend as a partial entity name and and pull the user object into the friend like this last model better because it allows you to represent friends more you would still have a copy of the friend name if it is a duplicate of the user and the id to identify if the user is gone or keeps the concept a little further away from the concept and any security i will argue appropriate to duplicate the field as it adds flexibility and information about a user that used to take on you would still have to eventually back to the user but perhaps not as if you really hate to anything you can have a person object that friend and user both refer to for i think that is a nice theoretical but not worth the complexity it would introduce into the bulk of your code of it being talking about the user and talking about the i would make the user easy to talk about and the friend a little not this i enjoyed mentally toying with this

database structure is more since it provides the structural framework on which your code is in general ymmv quite refactoring your db structure after completing a phase of development is significantly harder than simply refactoring code which depends on a stable the reason is refactoring your db structure usually forces code the reverse is rarely your code depends on your database more than your database depends on your this is not the you may need to rethink your address your i think a lot of folks writing blogging about this type of issue tend to come quite strongly from the side of these types of folks tend to consider database design to be and less interesting than coding interesting to someone who likes to solve tends to be the people who blog the coding side is more interesting than the fundamental design and while the fundamental design issues extremely important database design is a very fundamental design

decided to look at the problem and see if i could break it into 5x5 solutions with the ending of a solution one jump away from the corner of assumption was that 5x5 is it is and i ran and looked at the i drew a 10x10 numbered grid in excel with a 5x5 numbered grid for then i just searched the results for that would be a jump away from the start of the next for the first i searched for x 10 grid 5 x 5 grid 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 5 6 7 8 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 10 11 12 13 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 15 16 17 18 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 20 21 22 23 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 is a possible puts it a diagonal jump up to 5 the first corner of the next 5 x puts it with last square of 25 in the which is two jumps away from puts it with last square of 97 in the which is two jumps away from square can be any valid because end point the mapping of the solution from 5x5 to 10x10 is as the square is starting on the opposite instead of ran and picked one at should be possible to all do now that 5x5 solutions are know to be valid with endpoints legal moves to the next 5x5 number of 5x5 solutions was which means storing the solutions for further calculation and remapping is pretty i did this this gives you one possible solution above 5x5 solutions as one through four if i return 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 5 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 10 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 15 5 col5 50 row5 if i return 20 5 col5 50 row5 for i in for i in for i in for i in some one double check the i think this is a valid solution and method of breaking up the

easiest way of finding out how implemented is to try write some code which uses a captured compile then look at it in note that the which is not the one of the big differences between java and in this basic idea is that each level of scope containing at least one captured variable results in a new class with fields for the variables which have been if more than one then an inner scope also has a field for the next scope and so the genuine local variables on the stack end up being references to instances of the autogenerated an static void actions new for i int copyofi for j int copyofj foreach action in get different results if you take a copy of course this is compiled into code like static void actions new for i outerscope outer new for j innerscope inner new foreach action in class public int class public int public outerscope public void reference to the captured variable ends up going through the instance of the generated so not just a in this case nothing else in the code uses the captured but you can easily imagine it note how for any one iteration of the outer the five new instances all share one instance of you might want to try playing with extra code in the delegate to see how that affects things if the delegate changes that change will be seen in the next changes to be seen because the next delegate will be using a separate instance of

feature was in they defaulted to nullable references and used to indicate this was because they wanted backward my dream language which probably be the only make the same choice as by would also make it illegal to use the operator on a nullable reference anything else that would dereference how would you use have to convert them to how would you do by testing them for java and the statement can only accept a test extend it to accept the name of a nullable reference in this myobj is so can be special syntax would be unsurprising to prefer a special syntax like this to make it clear that we are doing a check that modifies the type of the name within the add a further bit of into anotherobj is so can be just gives the name to the result of the expression on the left of the so it can be used in the scope where it is do the same kind of thing for the message into m m message that is but so are the two possible results of the test so the assignment is then maybe a bit of sugar for the presumably common case of substituting a value for message or message would only be validly applied to a nullable type on the left and a on the right also have a notion of ownership for instance the compiler would generate the method and the syntax would be used to augment exactly as in had another syntactic extension related to due to the problem of ensuring that had been initialized correctly during private public other you have to initialize fields in the same way as call other constructors with or unless of course you initialize them directly next to the field

first part of your question has already been answered by no form of inheritance takes the vector behaves as a and nothing are two ways to manipulate the first one is through a for like you i you should use since that is the type returned by cout iterating through the elements contained in the so printing make there is only one cout to access the element contained in the cout is other approach is to use the algorithms defined in the standard as an introduction to going to split it up into a few every container also defines an iterator iterators are conceptually like pointers that point to a location in the so instead of you can call on the element point to by any given an iterator called the syntax would be reason for this is that it allows a common and generic way to traverse because deques and all other container types all provide and these iterators use the same your code can take a pair of denoting the beginning and the end of the range of elements you want to and then the same code will work regardless of the underlying container use a loop to run through the container but this time using current current cout cout is a huge improvement so although it does eliminate the index which often except as a loop the functions return an iterator pointing to the first element in the and another pointing past the of the so as we move the first iterator we know reached the end when it equals the end in this two iterators can represent any range of that we have iterators we can use a lot of other the standard library comes with a number of algorithms for processing sequences of located in the simple one to get us started is which is almost a replacement for a for it is simply a function which takes two denoting the range of elements it should and an action it should perform on so to call we need to define such an cout cout is a function which takes the element type as a and does whatever needs to be now we can call you need to do this it saves a lot of the print function only has to be defined and then every for loop can be replaced with such a nice trick with iterators is that they have to represent the entire we could skip the first five take only the first three any other manipulation you can think are also algorithms such as copy from one iterator range to may be any type of iterator as it have to be a vector iterator just because the source in fact we could even copy directly to if you wanted to print out the contents directly since myclass define the that would result in an work around this little problem with we could use which applies some transformation to each and then places the result into an output since we directly print out a myclass we could just transform it to a which be printed return is fairly simple we simply create a function which takes a myclass and builds a string with the desired so copy this directly to creates a special output stream iterator out of to allow it to function as an and once the actual this on everything in the code became a single the actual action to perform is defined so it have to clutter up the while a for loop is the immediately obvious way to process sequences of elements in a iterators are often a better solution in the long they offer a lot more and even simplifies your code quite a blame you if you prefer to stick with for loops for as a bit easier to i simply wanted to show you that not the answer in

have an existing perl application which is deployed to multiple customer the code has been cloned multiple times to customise it for individual so there are now several complete copies of the code which all have slight task is to fix this mess by creating a generic code base with customisations for different customers being isolated in their own application already has a class hierarchy about 120 along the lines goal is to be able to customise a specific class or method by modifying only the library for a particular first instinct is to create for anything that needs to be customised for a particular these would live in a lib directory per to customise a class or method for a i would just add a new to the customer if one method in needs to be i might create a subclass which inherits from and contains only the method to be in the main problem is that this will break the code for all other customers because they have the class in their it appears i would have to add an empty class to the library for every there a better other possibility considered is to use overrides instead of the main program would just need a to include the customer library and any methods to be customised would just be in the however this is probably dangerous and not considered best seek the wisdom of stackoverflow gurus in finding the best approach to this is the best way to customise parts of an existing perl program for multiple

how hard it is to find information about custom component setup i thought i would clear up some aspects of the process based on what i have the most part aaaidan example above is correct with one loaderinfo property of a displayobject refrences a loaderinfo from which your component gets its parameter settings the init event is called when it has gotten its data you could use the complete which should fire directly after the your setting up properties to be accessed using the metadata you can also define default values what i have experience the parameters seem to have trouble dealing with anything other then a string perhaps so i would suggest using set functions that take string values and use them to obtain the other values you may for example if you want to load a new instance of a specific named function set var as new this example if the parameter is set to calling will create a new sprite you want your custom component to resize in a way other then simply stretching the height and width values you need a public setsize this function will be called every time you resize your component in function this works great when your resizing the component in flash but once you actually publish your swf file you will notice that it switches back to stretching width and height rather then using your setsize function dont know why but thats what it to fix in your oninit function you need to take the width and feed them into your and then reset the scalex and scaley values back to 1 function scalex scaley other functions that need to be run once the parameters are anyone finds a less messy way of doing this let this helps someone get their custom components up and

i have the following interfaces and a class that implements them interface following code prints a a as if supports writeln writeln is a little annoying but supports cast to ibase because ibase is not in the list of guids that timplementation it can be fixed by changing the declaration to even without doing that i that a implements ibase because a is an iderived and an iderived is an so if i leave out the check i can cast a and everything will be fine a b a as b now successfully call any of we come across a problem when we start putting ibases into a generic container tinterfacelist for it can only hold iinterfaces so we have to do some a b list a as b list assert assertion i declared dowhatever in this works but it is not would very much like to have some sort of assertion to catch any mismatched types this sort of thing can be done with objects using the is but that work for for various i want to explicitly add ibase to the list of supported is there any way i can write timplementation and the assertion in such a way that it will evaluate to true iff is a safe thing to it came up in the one of the adding the two major reasons i do not want to add ibase to the list of interfaces that timplementation it actually solve the in the this does not mean it is safe to perform a queryinterface may return a different pointer to satisfy the requested for if timplementation explicitly implements both ibase and iderived then the assertion will pass does implement imagine that somebody mistakenly adds an item to the list as an as assertion still passes the item still implements but the reference added to the list is an iinterface only it to an ibase would not produce anything so the assertion sufficient in checking whether the following is the only way guaranteed to work would be to use an or as this is a frustrating performance as it is intended to be the responsibility of the code adding items to the list to ensure they are of the type ibase we should be able to assume this the assertion to catch if this assumption is the assertion even except to catch later mistakes if anyone changes some of the the original code this problem comes from is also fairly performance so a performance cost that achieves little still only catches mismatched types at but without the possibility to compile a faster release is something rather second reason is i want to be able to compare references for but this be done if the same implementation object is held by different references with different vmt expanded the above edit with an the question is how can i formulate the assertion so that the is safe iff the assertion not how to avoid the there are ways to do the step or to avoid it but if there is a runtime performance i use i want all the cost of checking within the assertion so that it can be compiled out said if someone can avoid the problem altogether with no performance cost and no danger that would be how can you check if an iinterface reference implements a derived but not

i understand it this is a problem you wish to load images from an internet url instead of a local this means that you have to have some way of listing the files available at the remote if you look at the problem you will realize that the only difference between retrieving images from a remote location and from your local system is that the files are easily enumerable using the directoryinfo the method here returns an array of and you can get the actual filename for each using the filename so you need a list of strings that map to the location of the enumerating the files from a remote location alone depends on many factors such as the protocol you are using to retrieve that if using and we can assume that you have some control over the server at that then the url would need to primarily support directory you will then need to parse that served directory list is and server and load all the available image as you can then populate your repeater with that see for a possible the server supports then you work becomes easier because you can enumerate the images using the or if you want to create thumbnails for the you will have to write code to download each save it in a temporary location and then perform dimensional manipulations upon if the list of images available at the internet location is static and you already have that you can simply load that list as a list of strings and set each image src property to that the thumbnails will however remain a unless you can upload your thumbnail creator http at that url so that files are retrieved locally for manipulation and thumbnails are served to you

ideal rule is that each of your layers should be a black box and none of them should depend on validation of another the reason behind this is that the db has no idea of the ui and vice so when the db throws an the ui must have db knowledge to convert that into something the ui layer can so it can eventually convert it into something the can making validation on every layer is also my either put the validation in a single place the business and make the other layers really they check anything write your validation in an abstract way into the model and then generate all validation from for namedesc new new new you can write code which examines the description stuff code or even at and do the validation in each layer with little cost because one change fixes all for you only have these some some error you should be able to get away with these exception classes which have value plus special info like the limit that was so wondering where your many exception classes come your other this is uh by the phase commit i say because there are situations when the protocol breaks down and in my much better to give the user a dialog or some other means to fix the problem rather than investing a lot of time into

incorrect response you are getting is most likely coming from a can use an header to find out what caching headers your server is sending or you can be certain with the addon for you are looking out header tells the browser to the same page for further requests before a certain without checking from the the same is true for a section within a that if you are seeing an expires header or then the browser may return a stale page without going back to the vaguely possible that your or a proxy server between your browser and your is adding cache validators like these to your pages whereas your server on your localhost if you could try to remove maybe the server admin has configured could override that in an if caused by a proxy server between your browser and your you may not have much few other things of should be using a post request rather than a get request if it is important that a certain action changes something on the responses to post requests are never cached if you do then the get after it may but another that your browser caching may behave differently when you are accessing something at compared to accessing it at any other even if the servers are configured the same and sending the same this is at least the case for firefox seen it ie also has different security which could plausibly affect making it behave differently on may force your server to output a header and a this could be done in php using two calls to the while browsers and proxies be defaulting to behaviour that can return a stale result when no validator is this at least makes it explicit that you absolutely want something also that if you are accessing the web via a proxy server this can also be affecting including which caching headers you

is the underlying architectural principle of the the amazing thing about the web is the fact that clients and servers can interact in complex ways without the client knowing anything beforehand about the server and the resources it the key constraint is that the server and client must both agree on the which in the case of the web is api that adheres to the principles of does not require the client to know anything about the structure of the the server needs to provide whatever information the client needs to interact with the an is an example of the server specifies the location of the and the required browser know in advance where to submit the and it know in advance what information to both forms of information are entirely supplied by the principle is called how does this apply to and how can it be implemented in http is oriented around verbs and the two verbs in mainstream usage are get and which i think everyone will the http standard defines several others such as put and these verbs are then applied to according to the instructions provided by the imagine that we have a user database that is managed by a web our service uses a custom hypermedia based on for which we assign the mimetype might also be an and many media types may be the client and the server has both been programmed to understand this but they know anything about each as points rest api should spend almost all of its descriptive effort defining the media used for representing resources and application or in defining extended relation names for existing standard media request for the base resource might return something like know from the description of our media that we can find information about related resources from sections called this is called in this we can tell from such a section that we can find a user list by making another request for can tell a lot from this for we now know we can create a new user by posting to also know that we can change existing that we are using different http verbs delete to manipulate these and that the only knowledge we presume on the clients part is our media many much better answers on this very i explained rest to my api has hypermedia answer has been subject of a fair amount of criticism for missing the for the most that has been a fair what i originally described was more in line with how rest was usually implemented a few years ago when i first wrote rather than its true revised the answer to better represent the real

libraries are composed of objects created from source what linkers usually do is include the object if a function that is provided by that object is if your source file only contains one function than only that function will be brought in by the there are more sophisticated linkers out there but most c based linkers still work like there are tools available that split c source that contain multiple functions into artificially smaller source files to make static linking more fine you are using shared libraries then you impact you compiled size by using more or less of however your runtime size will include

most effective data structure for a cache is an caches work if your data structure is laid out sequentially as cpus read entire cache lines 32 bytes or at once from main algorithm which accesses memory in random order trashes the caches because it always needs new cache lines to accomodate the randomly accessed on the other hand an which runs sequentially through an array is best gives the cpu a chance to speculatively put more memory into the which will be accessed this gives a huge performance a tight loop over a large array also allows the cpu to cache the code executing in the loop and in most cases allows you to execute an algorithm entirely from cache memory without having to block for external memory

much of computing is probably the best by by contract can help development greatly by explicitly documenting the conditions for a just the documentation can be a help without even making it into feasible i recommend defensive checking every but only for development and debug in this way most invalid assumptions are caught when the conditions are a good build system would allow you to turn the different condition types on and off at a module or file level as well as actions taken in release versions of software then depend upon the system and how the condition is triggered usual distinction between external and internal interfaces the release version could be all conditions give a defined result can include errors or me is a dead end in the real you assume that if you passed the right values in of course you then the value you receive is if your assumption was wrong you break

my current project we use a simplified version of the query object pattern that mausch in our case we have a search criteria object that consists of a field and a and several such objects can be added to a we did have an operator property from the but it was never used so we removed whether the criteria are treated as and or or depends on the search method that is used would say that it is and in of the cases in that find methods themselves do not do a lot with this they will invoke stored procs in the passing the criteria as most of those procs are fairly straight even though we have a couple that does involve some string handling to unpack lists of critera for certain code from a perspective might look something like this controller classes wraps repetetive stuff as instantiating a search object with a configurable populating it with search criteria and customers customer more than one search criterion is needed a collection can be passed inside the finder function the code will loop over the map the present values to appropriate parameters in an sqlcommand approach has worked out rather well for the means that we have created an architecture wher the search objects are defined as abstract classes that merely will define the interface and contain some generic and post the actual search code is implemented in separate decendent which amongst other things allowed us to quickly create a data that could be used for mocking away the database for some of the unit	
my every pear project that was potentially interesting had major points against is targetted at the widest audience there are hacks in place all over the place to deal with php new useful features are ignored if they be emulated on older meaning you end up lagging behind the core language given project tends to grow until it solves problem with a single simple when your php interpreter has to process all of that source code on every page hit the authors may not have designed it to be there is a measurable overhead for processing thousands of unused lines of was always it never felt like i was learning generalizable apis like in other used to use at we discovered that most of our scripts spent their time inside pear code instead of our own replacing that with a very simple wrapper around functions significantly reduced execution time and increased runtime due to the use of prepared used its own at the logic for postgres because the native functions were too new to be used i feel like pear is good as a in many it is likely to be higher quality code than any individual will produce in a short amount of but i would certainly not use it in a popular website not without a lot of tweaking by maintaining my own

my experience with a couple of coverity prevent for was decidedly worth finding some bugs even in good and a lot of bugs in the worst others have already covered technical so focus on the political the developers whose code need static analysis the are the least likely to use it so afraid need strong management in practice as well as in otherwise it might end up as just a checklist to produce impressive metrics without actually getting bugs any static analysis tool is going to produce false probably going to need to dedicate somebody to minimizing the annoyance from by triaging prioritizing the and tweaking the commercial tool should be extremely good at never showing a false positive more than that alone may be worth the even the genuine defects are likely to generate my advice on this is not to worry comments grumbling that obviously destructive bugs are biggest piece of advice is a corollary to my first take the cheap shots and look at the painfully obvious bugs from your worst some of these might even have been found by compiler but a lot of bugs can slip through those when suppressed by really blatant bugs can be politically with a top ten list of the funniest which can concentrate minds if used

one part of the application working there is a form control that does validation on reception of the cmexit which is exactly how the delphi documentation says to do it code sample is from the delphi help tell data link to update database on exception do if it let focus leave purpose of this is to perform the validation as soon as the control loses for if i were to click on the ok the form control would lose this method would run and on an exception would set the focus back to that form the event on the ok button would never go through and the dialog would never problem having is that this form control is inside a modal dialog clicking ok does indeed send the cmexit message and causes the record to update validation to pressing enter while in the form control causes the modal dialog to close sending the cmexit as if the form control never this means that not only does the dialog close without the form actually validating the but the data set this where is the best place for me to place my dataset i could move it up to the dialog form itself and implement it in the onclosequery but this would mean that the logic is duplicated in both the form control on the form form control is used in other and i want to avoid changing its speculate that cmexit triggered because the control never actually lose the form is but the form control still on the closed cmexit message not sent when modal dialog is

opening post probably meant qt which definitely is a complete creator comes in two a simple one which is open source and is licensed only to create open source and a paying one which is licensed to create both oss and qt creator is just as portable between platforms as qt itself and uses the mingw compiler under ms windows and the gcc compiler under speaking i found open source qt a polished piece of software which gives a much smoother and more pleasant user experience than kdevelop tries so desperately to implement slews and slews of bells and whistles that it neglects to make simple things easy and and it has few features and a much simpler interface than kdevelop the paying version also has a more complicated the qt framework exclusively allows you to easily make applications that run under linux ms windows with no more than a and which look the same on both kde on the other hand is i especially liked is that importing about 35 files from a commandline app developed under having qmake set up the makefile and then compiling it worked like a as opposed to kdevelop where a big easy to have qt creator set up a commandline app now that the commandline version compiles i can easily make a qt gui to prepare the options set the pick and click all the input and set the output the only thing i have to change is to change my previous function into something let qt generate a main app for and then and call it in response to a i had such a hell of a time trying that with kde and kdevelop a year or so ago that i completely gave up and went back to you really really want to develop for kde only and are determined to use kde functionality that goes above and beyond i would choose qt

optimizing because of past experience and due to profiler i realize an alternative optimization would be to call less but that is a secondary issue at the have a very simple function described in i call it within a foreach i call that function a lot times per a while i coded a variation of this program in java and was so disgusted by the speed that i ended up replacing several of the for loops which used it with 4 if loop unrolling seems but it did make a noticeable difference in application come up with a few potential optimizations and thought i would ask for opinions on their merit and for four if statements and totally ignore the dry i am confident this will improve performance based on past but it makes me to the 4 if statements would be pasted anywhere i called too frequently and would then have the inside of the foreach block pasted within the results in some mysterious a property to all generate its contents at a code generation utility to turn calls to getneighbors into if statements as part of static square int x int y if yield return if yield return y if yield return if yield return y yield property of model used to get square int return of the time spent by the getneighbors function is spent on the call to the other is spent in the method ienumerable

personal ideal is to write enough commentary so that reading just the comments explains how and why a function is intended to be how it should usually come out from well chosen variable names and clear way to achieve at least on the comment is to use a tool such as from the start coding each new function by writing the comment describing what it is for and how it should be doxygen configured have document generation included as a build and read the resulting only comment template that might be helpful would be one that sketches in the barest beginning of the doxygen comment but even that might be too you want the generated documentation to explain what is important without cluttering it with worthless placeholder text that will never get

point numbers should be used for what they were designed computations where what you want is a fixed and you only care that your answer is accurate to within a certain if you need an exact answer in all best using something are three domains where you might use floating apps require a lot of number and often use sophisticated numerical methods to solve systems of differential typically talking floating point of games as a simulation where ok to if the physics is to seem real then ok for and you can make up in user experience what missing in terms of games usually use floating science statistical methods need a lot of floating a lot of the numerical methods are the the application domain is just you find a lot of statistics and monte carlo simulations in financial applications and in any field where analyzing a lot of survey point and for most business applications you really need to know all these fine just knowing that you represent some decimal numbers exactly in floating and that you should be sure to use some decimal type for prices and things like you really want to get into the details and understand all the tradeoffs and check out the classic every programmer should know about floating or pick up a book on or numerical linear if really

pointer arithmetic and relative comparisons are defined only within to be confused with an is a variable any or a memory area allocated with you can compute a pointer to the and this will always work in a standard conforming at things at a lower a pointer is typically implemented as an the size of the integer is large enough to hold the address of any memory the only way for a pointer to overflow is if you exceed the address and that is impossible to do while conforming to the c if you are writing and ignoring the restriction that pointer arithmetic is only valid within an the best way to do this is to take advantage of the knowledge of how pointers are in most modern this then becomes the same thing as checking for overflow with unsigned integer to that will be things like segmented memory of the 8086 or multics and probably other things i may have suppressed from my memory my	
possible to return an instance other than self from classes do for to enforce a singleton or in the case of class for returns a subclass depending on the type of value passed to its so when you call initializer is called after but a subclass of may be returned to the oringial thus the reassigns to the value of so that points to the actual instance that if or the method the result of may be to side effects in the case of a failed the pattern then init do initialization of instance variables return that you must return or an other from the you assign self to and you may check for before doing more may have to release the return value of a staic you should read the cocoa memory management the rule is generally quite if the method you call has or in its the result belongs to the caller and the caller must call on that instance or there will be a memory of course you should call on anything else not from an or you want to keep a reference to and then call or when you are done with that assuming was declared as assigns the address of the string constant to the value of the you do not need to retain or release string allocates a new string the value of will be the address of this each call of again will allocate a new so after while after see answer as adds the receiver to the current when the pool is drained at the end of the current run loop or when the pool is manually the pool calls on all instances in the if this drops the retain count to the object is deallocated just as with any other using an autorelease pool is generally frowned upon on the iphone because it may cause you to accumulate many unused instances in the pool before it is drained at the end of the run loop if you can use instead of you generally see the cocoa memory management

problem is that actually do any boundary checking with regards to it depends on the os to ensure that you are accessing valid this particular you are declaring a stack based depending upon the particular accessing outside the bounds of the array will simply access another part of the already allocated stack space and threads reserve a certain portion of memory for as long as you just happen to be playing around in the stack everything will not crash i did not say happening on the last line is that you have now accessed beyond the part of memory that is allocated for the as a result you are indexing into a part of memory that is not allocated to your process or is allocated in a read only the os sees this and sends a seg fault to the is one of the reasons that is so dangerous when it comes to boundary

processor operates what is known as a machine code instructions are fairly they do all that much in a single for adding two numbers would have a sequence of instructions with semantics a pointer to the address of operand 1 into register the value stored at the address stored in register 1 into register a pointer to the address of operand 2 into register the value stored at the address in register 1 into register the contents of register 2 and register 3 and store it in register a pointer to the destination into register the contents of register 4 in the address specified in register the processor is a special set of fast memory known as a which contains the memory that the processor uses to store data that it is working on at the the register file has several which are uniquely instructions typically work on especially on risc while this is not always the case it is a good enough abstraction for the a processor has to load or store data into a register to do anything with operations such as arithmetic work on taking the operands from two registers and placing the result into a third the benefit of the peanut i used a 6502 lets not confuse the issue the processor has special instructions for loading or storing data from registers into the main processor has a special register called the that stores the address of the next operation to the sequence for executing an instruction goes roughly the instruction stored at the current address in the program the picking apart the actual what registers it the it works out where to get or store and some other bits and the the instruction will change the values in various for a instruction will copy a value into a an arithmetic or logical will take two values and compute a a jump or branch instruction will change the address at the program counter so the processor starts to fetch instructions from a different processor can have special an example of such is the program counter described another typical one is a condition flags this will have several bits with special for example it may have a flag that is set if the result of the last arithmetic operation was this is useful for conditional you can compare two if they are the flag is the processor can have a conditional instruction that is only executed if this flag is this you could decrement a counter in a register and if it was a condition flag is a conditional on can be used for a loop where you decrement a counter and exit the loop if the result of the decrement instruction is on some processors the arm all instructions are with a special condition for examples of typical processor instructions or decrement a or store the contents of a register into you can also have the address to load or store offset by the contents of another this allows you to easily loop over an array of data by incrementing the other logical operations to calculate these take operands from two registers and place the result in a to another location this moves the contents of the location into the program counter and starts to fetch instructions from the new or pop values onto a stackoverflow has an example of a small snippet of compiled c code and the assembly language output from that it should give you an example of the sort of relationship between a language and the machine code output that it compiles best way to learn this is to get an assembler and try it this used to be much easier on simpler computers like micros of the the closest thing to this type of architecture available these days are embedded you can get a development board for an embedded processor like a microchip pic fairly as this type of architecture has less baggage than a modern operating system there is less and to use system this will make it easier to bootstrap an assembly language program on this type of the simpler architecture is also easier to option is to get an emulator such as this will emulate a cpu and let you assemble and run programs on the advantage of such an emulator is that they will also have facilities for single stepping programs like a and showing the contents of the register this may be helpful in gaining insight as to actually going

put this edit at the top since it directly answers your question of why word is your copy constructor is const theobject make a copy of what points just the so you effectively have two objects pointing to the same internal this gets very bad when a word object gets a proper implementation the techniques you i recomend against would be like const theobject new 1 earwicker noted the following as although that is not a copy so one will and does the same and therefore the same still remedy need to make a proper copy constructor which should have the word this code infile new word like you reallocate after word is read and entirely forget to delete the previous once again show a sane implementation using the techniques you are attempting to infile new word how it counts the then allocates room after it knows how much to now is ready to be used for up to word you just replace the class with it would make the code much smaller and easier to work it makes it easier for just do you can do like it has the added bonus of removing the need for you to use the member to get the would also change your to just be a that way you can simple do more dynamic all done for size of the word array will be limited only by the amount of ram you because grows as needed when you use if you do what to get the word count you simply do need to manually keep track of the number of this code is infile2 eof set till you attempt a you are better off using this will correctly stop on if you do this there should be very little actual code you need to a sample straight forward implementation of what i think you from the menu items it seems that the intention is for the user to choose option then zero or more times to filter out some then finally c to print the results word per option really needed since hitting sends an eof to the program and makes the test thus ending the least in my it might be for it makes no effort did to deal with but here it public bool char const return make a read a text remove words starting with print words to const int const char char case case a file scope so we can have locals int words read from the file case case scope so we can have locals letter to char remove all words starting with a certain case case output each word to separated by return	
put together a fairly lengthy answer to a similar entity decision making between orm since you asked i pick nhibernate for an web solution next version of the entity framework should be worth taking a long hard look the first version ready for large scale deployment and the generated leaves a lot to be but i see a big future if the adoef team can put it together it could be really especially if able to consume the revamped sql data brush up on esql and get used to the syntax for using linq to write data something tells me this will be excellent experience to have handy for the next few

question is whether your test setup represents the reality of your application or in are you testing the right your app going to be appending large numbers of records one at a is it going to be appending batches of records based on a sql the you might look at trying to do it all particularly if the source in the select are on the important to realize that with a batch append is going to be sent to the sql server as a single insert for every single row similar to the approach in your test if you move the same process entirely it can be done as a batch you should test again using ado instead of it may optimize the operation completely of someone brought to my attention just this past week this fascinating article by andy microsoft office access applications linked to sql still absorbing the contents of that very useful and it discusses several issues in regard to topics that may help you optimize your process for maximum

reads the file in the current line of the file is stored in basically the same as technically it expands to but very close to the same thing either so you need to worry about with no arguments is equivalent to it splits the current line into a list of items between so it splits the current line into a list of words or and stores this list in an this line is should be qualified with perl would catch this if you have and at the push pushes a reference to an anonymous array containing the elements that were in into which is an array of arrays you probably already in the you have a list where each element in the list corresponds to a line of the and each element of the list is another list of the words on that should be declared using and you should and in as has been you could do away with push using a temporary array may be nicer on anyone who has to add to this code i missed the regex you wanted to last unless push catch all integers it match if you want it to match negative use if you want to match you could use but i know if you want to match these regexes will match invalid entries like and which are not integers or if you want to be more strict about try my this line for floating last loop unless this line for just last loop unless push

recently started work on a project which involves creating a reporting interface for a fairly old software responsible for managing some access control hardware like electronic door locks for have chosen cakephp for the task and all it involves is querying the database for the log records and displaying them on the the software is written in and uses msde version of microsoft sql server or and i was able to configure cakephp so that it successfully connects to the problem is that the developer of this software has chosen to store the logs in the database by creating a separate table for each so it looks like am not really familiar with msde but i still doubt that it is an acceptable practice to design and maintain a database like i do not know how the desktop software manages to parse query all the information when all in this format but my cakephp application is having some really hard time chewing this want to stick with mvc for the web application but i know how to implement the dooreventmodel in cakephp so that it gets the information from all the partitioned tried implementing some hacks like all select from all select from this sort of works but when i want to perform where restriction on the whole query or any other sql operator it one of the requests was that the application does not add or create any additional databases or tables and only uses the existing ones to display the reports so creating one huge table that includes all of the clustered ones is not really an just hope that someone will come up with an sqlserver function that will merge all tables into one for me every time i perform a query but i know this is a bit so open to all suggestions please remember that the solution must work with cakephp and as a single model in the data from multiple clustered tables as one

refers to the fact when types are considered equivalent by what methods them not based on their declared to take a concrete many methods in ruby take a object to operate on a this means that the object has to implement enough functions to be able to pass as an io type object has to sound enough like a the end it means that you have to write less code than in java to do the same everything is not great about dynamic you more or less give up all of the typechecking that java other typed gives ruby simply has no idea if about to pass the wrong object to a that will give you a runtime it give you a runtime error until the code is actually

say code is which implies that the algorithms are you save the sets are several terabytes in is all about finding and eliminating obvious bottleneck is the bandwidth to the data given the size of the guessing that the data is held on a server rather than on a desktop you given any details of the algorithms is the time taken by the algorithm greater than the time taken to the does the algorithm work on subsets of the total going to assume that the algorithm works on chunks of data rather than the whole have two scenarios to algorithm takes more time to process the data than it does to get the in this you need to optimise the algorithm takes less time to process the data than it does to get the in this you need to increase the bandwidth between the algorithm and the the first you need a developer that can write good assembler code to get the most out of the processors leveraging gpus and multicores if whatever you just crank up the number of threads because as soon as the number of threads exceeds the number of your code goes this due to the added overhead of switching thread another option is to use a seti like distributed processing system many pcs in your organisation are used for admin purposes think of all that spare processing as bh213 can be an order of magnitude slower than well written using but that is a niche skillset these the latter where limited by then you need to improve the network connecting the data to the make sure using the latest ethernet equipment 1gbps everywhere use wireless as if lots of other consider a dedicated network in parallel with the consider storing the data closer to the clients for every five or so clients use a dedicated server connected directly to each client which mirrors the data from the saving a few percent of processing time saves of thousands of then seriously consider getting a consultant two actually one one they should easily pay for themselves in the savings sure many here that are suitably qualified to if reducing cost is the ultimate then consider write code that keeps the cpu ticking over below this saves energy directly and indirectly through reduced thus costing want more bang for your buck so again have more overhead more cpu work more more in when it comes to saving money a lot more to it than what language going to

see much difference between and cocoa in this your question is equivalently applicable to those platforms as well same also applies to stores and relational an object oriented you have to make a between the flexibility of the approach for storing data and the structured and object oriented go with the approach only when i need the flexibility the structure is dynamic and might change by user or not known at compile taking that route might get you completely off the oop conventions and benefits the this is the important does the hassle of sticking to object oriented principles worth it for that specific i think your question reduces to this one and to answer you should analyze your specific

segfault is not an intended action of your c program that would tell you that an index is out of it is an unintended consequence of undefined c and if you declare an array are only allowed to access elements with indexes from up to anything outside of that range causes undefined if the index was near the most probably you read your own if the index was largely out of most probably your program will be killed by the operating but you anything can does c allow the basic gist of c and is to not provide features if they cost c and has been used for ages for highly performance critical c has been used as a implementation language for kernels and programs where access out of array bounds can be useful to get fast access to objects that lie adjacent in having the compiler forbid this would be for it warn about you can put warning levels high and hope for the this is called of if some compiler uses open behavior undefined to do something it has a good quality of implementation in that gcc in function array subscript is above array it instead would format your hard disk upon seeing the array accessed out of bounds which would be legal for it the quality of implementation would be rather i enjoyed to read about that stuff in the c

some on a 3ghz powerpc on that a virtual function call costs 7 nanoseconds longer than a direct function not really worth worrying about the cost unless the function is something like a trivial in which anything other than inline is kind of a 7ns overhead on a function that inlines to is a 7ns overhead on a function that takes 500ms to execute is big cost of virtual functions really the lookup of a function pointer in the vtable usually just a single but that the indirect jump usually cannot be this can cause a large pipeline bubble as the processor cannot fetch any instructions until the indirect jump call through the function has retired and a new instruction pointer the cost of a virtual function call is much bigger than it might seem from looking at the but still only 7 not and others also raise the very good point that a virtual function call may cause an instruction cache if you jump to a code address that is not in cache then the whole program comes to a dead halt while the instructions are fetched from main this is a significant on about 650 cycles my this a problem specific to virtual functions because even a direct function call will cause a miss if you jump to instructions that in what matters is whether the function has been run before recently it more likely to be in and whether your architecture can predict static branches and fetch those instructions into cache ahead of my ppc does but maybe most recent hardware timings control for the influence of icache misses on execution since i was trying to examine the cpu pipeline in so they discount that

sounds like what asking about involves serializing the data structure of a django model instance for the other posters are if you wanted the serialized form to be used with a python application that can query the database via then you would wan to serialize a queryset with one on the other what you need is a way to the model instance somewhere else without touching the database or without using then you have a little bit of work to what i i use for the it happened to be what i found but it might not be the my implementation depends on one of its but there should be similar ways with other implement a method on all models that you might need this is a magic method for but probably something going to want to think about no matter what implementation you the idea is that you return an object that is directly convertible to an array or if you really want to do this dictionary for field in return will not be helpful to you unless you have a completely flat data structure only numbers and strings in the you should seriously think about the right way to implement this call and you have what you

standard has designed iterators to feel and behave as much like pointers as since iterators are based on the only relevant thing is that the iterator type has the proper operators the result is that pointers will behave just like random access a possible implementation of is to just make it a for an array you have the useful and methods to find the valid iterator but the problem you always have with c style as has been mentioned in the comments and other you can implement those functions for arrays if the array is not dynamic and has not decayed into a but my basic point was that you have to be more careful than when using the standard

structured exception handling is has a when an exception windows first looks for a handler for the exception by following the registered exception handler chain head of which is stored in on the first dword in the segment pointed to by the fs segment register all that ugly logic go away in it just became less search is done by calling a function with a particular a pointer to which is stored in each exception frame on the points to the topmost each frame points to the previous the last frame on the list is one that has been provided by the os handler will pop up a dialog if an unhandled exception reaches functions normally check the type of the and return a code to indicate what to one of the codes that can be returned is this exception and if windows sees it will reset the instruction pointer to the point of the exception and resume another code indicates that this exception frame should handle the given a third code is not going to catch this keep windows keeps on calling these exception filter functions until it finds one that handles the exception one way or the windows finds one that handles the exception by catching then it will proceed to unwind the stack back to that which consists of calling all the functions only passing in a different at this point that the functions execute the up until the handler which executes the with the stack page guard the process is none of the exception handlers will elect to handle this because otherwise the stack growth mechanism would the filter search filters all the way through to the base exception handler provided by the which grows the stack allocation by committing the appropriate and then returns the appropriate return code to indicate that the os should continue where it left rather than unwind the tool and debugging infrastructure are designed to let these particular exceptions play out so you need to worry about handling can read more about seh in excellent article in msj from over a decade

suggest that or now probably their newer should be strongly from your previous experience i expect you know it add much size to your is reasonably perfect and has excellent over the years their sql dialect has been refined so now very nice with high degree of ansi is as you note not open but the licensing cost is per developer only per so if there are only a few developers involved the cost is my licensing cost is especially reasonable when you consider the level of support and responsiveness you get on where the main is actively involved answering questions and solving aside from cost of a proprietary of course also concern over whether the business will survive and product will continue to be developed and supported in the something you have to weigh for but development seems as strong as got providers for their and support development with plus to fulltext search is that it is tightly integrated into the that you can issue a single select statement that directly combines ordinary where criteria on some fields with fulltext search criteria on depending on your this is a nice feature that makes it really simple and fast to do some things that would take more work using a different fulltext i think most like lucene and others that might be used with integrate as closely with regular sql and restrict you to retrieving a set of records with fulltext criteria something like proprietary for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex query that would apply both regular and fulltext but dbisam does it more and adding a proprietary to an open source db sort of defeats the purpose of going open shortcoming of fulltext i is that is supports only use of and have any proximity notice that there is a fulltext solution for i ever used but i know a lot of people love one area where pretty sure has big advantage is in applications where robust locking functionality is though that necessarily carry any weight at all for desktop

the validation can be done at many different levels and usually none of them is of the model can be populated with invalid data that do not come from the but we can also create forms whose data do not go to any the direct validation in models is unsually not integrated with our form rendering which causes problems if we want to show the error messages and the form with the data of the solutions have their own pros and it would be perfect to have a system that ensures us that the validation finally must be done at some if the form does not validate some then the model does and vice i heard of such but i must note that the validators in the frameworks unsually are you can pass the post data to but the same can be done with the information retreived from a properly parsed mysql

them in and of itself i find myself using them less and less the more i a few reasons why i use am tempted to protected methods make a simpler api for any client the code is dangerous if used the code is dangerous if used the class or any of its the code is doing too avoid making any arguments as to whether protected methods are a good idea or but based on the above the amount of times that you protected methods all that in my more frequently a crutch than they are a all you have to do is inherit from the class to gain access to in most modern languages you even have to do that consider how much benefit getting from how many times have you accidentally called a method that supposed to be called outside its and if going to allow the method to be called by anyone and everyone who wants to inherit from your why you just make it if you want to control who can access a why not just leave it out of the you are exposing an interface rather than giving direct access to the not trying to side with your friend or make any kind of case against protected they have but you should think about whether you have a valid reason to make a method protected or whether creating them because what was drilled in your head in your programming for usually the

there are a couple ways to approach i would probably just use which should work just fine for your purposes long as the map is from rather than if you want to go through some it is possible to give a type for trait val class extends class extends class extends assuming that you were reading the json field into a scala field named you would give that field the following time you pull a field out of you would need to pattern checking whether the value was of type or two of once you have the inner you would then pattern match on to determine whether it represents an or you have to do this sort of pattern matching anyway in order to use the data once you pull it out of the advantage to the approach is the compiler will check you to ensure that you missed any the disadvantage is that you just skip impossibilities mapping to an there is some overhead imposed by all of these wrapper so watch out for that scala does allow you to define a type alias which should cut down on the amount of loc required for a few implicit conversions to make the api and you should be all nice and

there is nothing per with handling an exception at a low an exception is a valid message that provides a lot of detail for why an operation cannot be and if you can handle you ought general if you know there is a high probability of failure that you can check you should do the your not familiar enough with the library to know if date time has an easy way to check whether a timestamp is out of if it just call your code is basically basically it comes down to whichever way creates cleaner if the operation to guard against an expected exception is more complex than just handling the than you have my permission to handle the exception instead of creating complex guards

there should be no problem putting them all inside of a when inside of a class you can name any variable defined so far simply by naming a b c a yields the result because while python is executing a class body the functions can the variables a and b that have been so the following also def def what about your merger the problem is that the wrapper function gets run long the class body is done and the variables it defined are no longer in the enclosing how can you refer to by using the name of the class as a like def def def def def the general rule with python code that runs right at the level of the class body can talk about all the variables and methods that have been defined so far inside of and this means you can use those class variables as but once you are of a function in the whether a class a static or a method this wrapper is a class method since it takes args but no then you have to use the name of the class to its craig craig

they have been using they might not be familiar with the mvc architecture to begin with and you might have to talk about that a little they are all developers and you have only 15 i would suggest you show them file new for mvc project and briefly talk about the a big sell for mvc in that it works off the go and you are already set up for iterative that you could switch to a working demo of a simple for this i would step through the application with a debugger from routing in to controller action to model and eventually back up to the this will bring up interesting questions and explain the new application life cycle including this will also implicitly highlight the differences between mvc and you have wfetch fiddler or live http then i would show the client side request as well and highlight the absence of view states and highligh the verbs if you are using maybe mention the usefulness of this in ajax questions on how to migrate the current app and what the value proposition is for your current

think a answer for really dependent upon the architecture chosen for your state if all the logic for changing state were encapsulated within your order then i would say it would be poor practice to expose a setstate since you have already placed some of the logic outside the order it seems appropriate to expose a public setstate or something your other choice would be to move the logic into the order based on what it seems as if that would create a very complex in patterns are really just there to help you architect your not to set hard and fast you should apply patterns to your architecture in the way that works not architect to

think part of it is that imap is usually used in scenarios where the emails are retained on the whereas pop is used almost exclusively for situations where the email is downloaded to the local which is what most isps providing email facilities for their customers want you to do also what most of the customers probably want as although less so as they get more exposure to the internet and things like gmail and reason it is probably preferred by email providers is that it does much like an rss news the pop client will open a connection to the authenticate ask for any email and do whatever processing it and then close the clients generally keep one or more sockets open with the server the whole time they are taking up those yet another reason for isps to prefer mail supports both pop and imap i do not mean to sound like i am having a go at i think the reasons attributed to them above are very pragmatic and

think that there 3 main reasons why arrays are passed as pointers in c instead of by the first 2 are mentioned in other no size information for arrays in general you include dynamically allocated i think a third reason is due evolution of c from earlier languages like b and where arrays were actually implemented as a pointer to the array ritchie talks about the early evolution of c from languages like bcpl and b and in particular how arrays are implemented and how they were influenced by bcpl and b arrays and how and why they are different remaining very similar in expressions because array names decay into pointers in

think your algorithm cannot be optimal because it makes no use of any measure of you use other metrics like and checking for drive a wedge between yours and an optimal we need to exploit that gap by looking for shapes with close vertices which would decompose for example the i found this on the polygon which forms a g or u have no protection against the point being connected across the concave which is to the algorithm is also quite and may be overdoing it just like complex you may find bugs in it because complex code makes complex a more extensive initial stage to break the shape into simpler shapes like triangles and then an iterative or genetic algorithm to recombine you will need a stage like this to combine any unnecessary divisions between your convex polys and by then you may have limited your possible decompositions to only a guess something into generate a number of a quality metric of the best of the decompose each using and generate a new set of from 4 until some measure of convergence is

this is a the important thing to be aware of is that the underlying tcp protocol does not maintain any segment that when you call multiple all of the data you sent may very easily be returned by a single call at the other the data sent in one call may be returned in multiple at the other if some packets got delayed due to network this is fundamental to the design of and your application must be designed as noted by the call returns the number of bytes that were read off the anything after that point in the buffer is and the data is not socket uses udp which is entirely as opposed to like udp does not guarantee reliability u stands for so you have to handle packets this is a lot harder than

truly mathematical way to look at building a recursive function would be as imagine you have a function that is correct for build f such that is build such that is is how you can prove that the function is and called it is equivalent to have different base or more complicated functions on multiple it is also equivalent to imagine that is correct for all for a build a function that can determine if it is possible to have a coin combination of 5 cents and 7 cents to make x for possible to have 17 cents by 2x5 but impossible to have 16 imagine you have a function that tells you if possible to create x as long as x call this function it should be fairly simple to imagine how to make the function for now build your if 7 return else if 5 return return trick here is to realize that the fact that works for means that you can substitute for if 7 return else if 5 return return last thing to do is to have a base case to stop infinite note that if you are trying to create 0 then that is possible by having no adding this condition if return else if 7 return else if 5 return return can be proven that this function will always using a method called but that necessary you can imagine that only calls lower values of and will always eventually reach use this information to solve your tower of hanoi i think the trick is to assume you have a function to move tablets from a to b any trying to move n tables from a to	
try to answer my own it in the first easiest way out of this situation is to refactor the code to avoid the problem are two obvious ways to do instance does not create a but instead relies on external code to supply then will no longer the instance and is not responsible for disposing of externally created instance could be supplied via the constuctor or by setting the class somedisposableobject no creation public public somedisposableobject get return set the instance main issue with the posted code is that the ownership is at dispose time the class cannot tell who owns the it could be the instance that it created or it could be some other instance that was created externally and via the if it tracks this and knows for certain that it is dealing with the instance that it then it still cannot dispose of it as other classes may now have a reference to it that they obtained from the public the code can be refactored to avoid making the instance public by removing the property then the issue goes if it be for some reason the code cannot be refactored in these ways i stipulated in the then in my opinion you are left with some fairly difficult design dispose of the you choose this approach then you are effectively declaring that will take ownership of the instance when the property is makes sense in some particularly where is clearly a transient or subservient however it should be documented carefully as it requires the calling code to be aware of this transfer of may be more appropriate to use a rather than a as the method name can be used to give a further hint about class somedisposableobject new public somedisposableobject get return set if null public void if dispose if still the original this approach you would track whether the instance was changed from the one originally created by and only dispose of it when it was the here the ownership model is remains the owner of its own but if an external instance is supplied then it remains the responsibility of the external code to dispose of approach best reflects the actual situation but it can be difficult to implement the client code can still cause issues by performing operations like acontainer new originalinstance new a new instance was swapped a method then the original instance was unfortunately the will have called on the original instance when it was so it is now give up and let the gc handle is obviously less than if the class really does contain some scarce resource then not disposing of it promptly will definitely cause you it may also represent the most robust approach in terms of how the client code interacts with as it requires no special knowledge of how treats the ownership of the you know that the disposable resource actually scarce on your system then this may actually be the best commenters have suggested that it may be possible to use reference counting to track if any other classes still have a reference to the this would be very useful as it would allow us to dispose of it only when we know it is safe to do so and otherwise just let the gc handle i am not aware of any api for determining the reference count of an if there is one then please let me

types can be set to null since reference type variables is just a pointer to the actual indicating the lack of an instance is easy since you can set the variable to null value types this is a bit harder since a value type variable always contains a the use of or was somewhat valid in the back then there was no easy way of expressing the lack of a value in value with nullable types you can d thus you can also have value type variables containing is a different story since it is directly tied to expressing the value in this was introduced before nullable types which imo supersedes

understand why people want to do things like sites written in things like silverlight or flash have their stuff break so often when the release hits the save yourself the in response to some comments i think i will just say that their is a good reason to avoid things like you need to install something else other than the web browser to get these sites to work and then your site may well not work when a new version of that is also a lot of people will be at work and possibly not able to install said program in the first these are reasons why i think that web stuff should be written in languages that only require the web browser with javascript turned on to definatly more

unless the purpose of the example is to demonstrate an aspect of exception this is a pet peeve of mine many examples try to demonstrate best practices and end up obscuring and complicating the i see this all the time in code examples that start by defining a bunch of interfaces and inheritance chains that necessary for the a prime example of over complicating was a lab i did at teched last the lab was on but the sample code i was directed to write created a application for no should start with the simplest possible code that demonstrates the then progress into usage and best an when asked for code samples from job candidates almost all of them are careful to demonstrate their knowledge of exception void do something catch throw received hundreds of lines of code with every method like started to award bonus points for those that use instead of throw	
unsure i understand the me if wrong but your trying to add to the on the 1st running of your if so do you want it on a 2nd pass you may want to enable disable the i remember correctly is only allowed in a directory section so it only makes sense to add enable in directory above is true you could do this in to will add to a directory section only if it does not already contain to the 2nd run you could as or if you like to regex is quite verbose and there are better to do the same thing but this is easier hopefully for a beginner to understand of the perl command force perl to read the whole file in one shot because 0777 is not a legal character places a loop around your lets you edit files so your command in change the file lets you specify a single line of code on the command that single line we have a see for info on that

variadic function is only weakly type in the function signature does not provide enough information for the compiler to know the type of each argument assumed by the this is on win32 and on it has to vary in size like that in order to perform its defined so for a variadic function to pull arguments out correctly which are of type the caller had to make certain that the compiler could tell that the argument was of that type at in the calling is a constant of type there is no defined suffix letter that marks a constant to be of type you could hide that fact inside a but that would be no clearer than writing at the call appears to work partially because of the actual calling convention used in from the examples we can tell that the first four integral arguments to a function are passed in and the rest on the that allowed count and the first three variadic parameters to be read it only to you are actually standing squarely in undefined behavior and really does mean anything can other anything can happen variadic functions are implicitly a special burden is placed on the coder to make certain that the type of each argument known at compile time matches the type that argument will be assumed to have at run some cases where the interfaces are well it is possible to warn about type for gcc can often recognize that the type of an argument to match the format and issue a but doing that in the general case for all variadic functions is

what i can tell unfortunately it is not possible to customize the color of the text displayed in the the closest been able to come is being able to modify the background color and the font of the is some code in the iphone developers cookbook by erica sadun which shows how to access the uitableviewindex view undocumented you can find the reference to it on page 175 of the book if you have which gives access to the background color and the you can see an unofficial document related to this class this is undocumented use of an undocumented class so you need to be cautious about using is a code snippet from the cookbook with minor in of cellforrow illustrates how you can access and the uitableviewindex view and modify it in some it looks like the view have any subviews so it is likely doing some custom drawing with the array of index not perfect but hopefully it helps a

will perform better on a given hardware than mvc can do better still being the operative word most of the platform is designed with enterprise development in testable separation of concerns a lot of the bloat in comes from the object stack within the page makes this better but it can be a key mvc tends to allow for less using the webforms based view engine are the biggest slowdowns in web applications happen tends to be remote especially database php is programmed without the benefit of connection or session this can be overcome with memcached and more performant service layers available to really comes down to the specifics of a this site happens to run mvc on fairly modest hardware quite a similar site under php would likely fall under its own other things to iis apache vs lighthttpd honestly the php vs is much more than raw performance php doesnt lend itself well to complex applications nearly so much as that this itself has more to do with than anything

working now on google trying to build something not even half as extensive but something on the lines of ok not going to be building the whole app got that much time on my however the application working on has users signing up and they would be able to pin point and create locations on a google map which would be stored in my there would be a search option whereby a user could search for a specific place and all list of matching entries would be displayed as an to the map and all places would be highlighted on the if noticed how wikimapia works you can add a place by virtually clicking and dragging on the map itself as opposed to adding in coordinates on some complicated form and the search is embedded within the map and not i have an idea of integrating basic google maps no biggie there but this is not just a simple integration does anyone have any idea what i need to do working on php and using jquery for for the response however my query was different in this respect that my application is such that we would have users signing up and they would come and pint point and create new locations on the map so basically its not one user all the coordinates would be entered by the users in a your place on the kind of way and we would like to be able to overlay all those details upon the map as well as categorise like lets say show all places on the map where theres a birthday or show all internet cafes on the map all these details are entered by missing something here but looking to make a simplified watered down version of wikimapia extensive google maps based

working on a rather large classic asp sql server new version was rolled out a few months ago with a lot of new and i must have a very nasty bug somewhere some very basic pages randomly take a very long time to few clues the database when i run the query it detect any long running i launch iis diagnostic reqviewer shows that the request is in state can happen on any reproduce it completely have an idea of very long this morning i had a page take more than 5 minutes to when it normaly should be returned to the client in less than 100 application can handle rather large upload and download of files to 2 gb in this is also handled with a classic asp using softartisan think it can cause the problem had these uploads for quite a while had the problem on two separate servers two separate with different sets of one is running the application with good sql server 2000 and the other runs sql server the web server is iis 6 in both idea what the problem is or on how to solve that kind of problem problem came from memory some asp pages were used to download files from the file sizes could go from a few kb to more than 2 these variations in size induced memory the asp pages could also take quite some time to execute time for the user to download the pages minus what is put in cache at which is not really standard for server pages that should execute is what i did to improve things all the download logic in a single asp page with session turned allowed me to put that asp page in a specific pool that could be recycled every so often would now disturb the rest of the application no on lfh fragmention which is not by default on windows in order to reduce memory for lfh is a dll there that you can use to turn on but the article is in have to learn our beautiful language can i find why some classic asp pages randomly take a real long time to

would add that one of the key reasons for having exceptions is to enable your application to handle errors at the most appropriate level in the code to do something sensible with exceptions provide a clean way to pass information back up the call stack to enable on what layer to handle various exceptions is a key decision in your application the type of application your are developing will affect the when developing a web or desktop it may be totally acceptable to handle the majority of exception types at a very high level this technique can save a lot of code when your application really cannot do much about the error and just needs to tell someone and log in a mission server you are likely to need fine grained control over exceptions in order to deal with them appropriately and keep the threads spinning no matter

you forget the parens in	
you give some background as to what you are rarely any reason for explicitly using on variables other than to clean up a namespace of things you want to not sure why you are calling or running is fine a different use of objects when the exact time they get finalised matter strings like you may as well let the variable drop out of scope when your function it will be and it cause any harm till manually calling for such variables just clutters up your objects which need to be finalised immediately an open or a held you be relying on the garbage collector anyway it is not guaranteed to immediately collect such it happens to do so in the standard c python but not in jython or and is so not you should explicitly clean up such objects by calling or using the new only other reason might be that you have a very large amount of memory and want to signal you are done with it before the variable that refers to it goes out of scope example seem to fit either of these circumstances so not sure why manually invoking the garbage collector at

you have a nested element for example a contextmenu with can easily apply styles or templates to the contextmenu or menuitem but if the menuitem style belongs to the menu style it is quite cumbersome and redundant to add it to every menuitem there any way to apply those automatically to child so that you can simply write would be neat if foomenustyle could style containing menuitem but that does not seem to be the menu example is probably misleading since i was unaware of itemcontainerstyle and the intent was for a general based on the two answers i have come up with two one general variant and one for itemcontainerstyle and the variant for specific style attribute general variant nested elements in

you should be developing pages that work regardless of screen creating separate pages for mobile devices means having to update things in two places when they need to this goes against the principle of repeat create a stylesheet using the handheld media type to serve your content to mobile this allows you to reposition the elements into a format quite just beware that many mobile devices will report to the server that they accept both handheld and screen media because they are trying to offer a consistent user experience with the you will likely need to override some screen rules in your handheld	
you should consider approaching the problem from a different rather than modify the stack why not just have your exception generator method in your the exception rather than throw then your call is revised static myexception return new calling might seem a little so you could rename to or but the requirement that the exception processing method does not show in the stack trace is met returns before the exception is thrown and is therefore not part of the stack to be my spent so much time working with that i forgot that in java exception stack traces are generated at where in exception stack traces are generated at this trick work in but not in	
you should have a dedicated archive strategy in a separate process that runs at could implement this either as a scheduled stored procedure or an additional background worker thread within your application or a totally separate application this would be a good place to put other regular housekeeping has a few apart from avoiding the trigger issue you should consider the performance implications of happening in a if you do many that trigger will do that work and effectively half the not to mention the lock contention that will arise as other processes try to access the same separate process that does housekeeping work minimises lock and allows the work to be carried out as a bulk in a last thing you should possibly consider archiving records to another table or rather than deleting

you try to preferences java debug suspend execution on uncaught in this for does eclipse work that back to when the breakpoint object hierarchy has been stripped order to set a with the old a client required java model objects such as with the new all that is required by the debug model is type field allows clients to set breakpoints when java model objects are not clients now specify the resource to associate a breakpoint with we constrained it to the associated java model can now also be that they need not be registered with the breakpoint breakpoints can also be selectively persisted only allowed of a marker type to be this makes the debug model more and gives clients more building has also simplified some part of our java debug implementation for feature on any uncaught simply sets a breakpoint for the type named rather than a specific in a specific breakpoint is not registered with the breakpoint manager it is only known and used by one another example is the to line the has been as its special functionality is no longer the java debug ui simply creates a that is non and has a hit count of this is an example of providing building blocks to

you using java concurrent from the documentation it appears to behave in a fashion which find a set view of the keys contained in this the set is backed by the so changes to the map are reflected in the and the set supports element which removes the corresponding mapping from this via the and clear it does not support the add or addall the returned iterator is a iterator that will never throw and guarantees to traverse elements as they existed upon construction of the and may is not guaranteed reflect any modifications subsequent to you can remove stuff and you should be not using this then which are you using why not being but it would be interesting to know why made that

you want to get down to uses an inverted index of the what this means is that google has an index of all pages crawled based on the terms in each for instance the term maps to this the google home and the wikipedia article for amongst when you go to google and type into the search google checks its index of all terms available on the internet and finds the entry for the term and with it the list of all pages that have that term referenced in veteran index goes beyond your simple inverted this is why google is the crawlers are very beyond just keeping track of the terms that are on any given web they also keep track of words that are on related pages and link those to the given other if a page has the term in it and the page has a link to or is linked from another web the other page may be referenced in the index under the term as all this and more go into why a given page is returned for a given you want to go into why pages are ordered the way they are in your search that gets into even more interesting get down to one of the most basic algorithms a search engine can use to sort your results is known as term document frequency simply this means that your results will be ordered by the relative importance of your search terms in the in other a document that has 10 pages and lists the word once is not nearly as important as a document that has 1 page and lists the word ten veteran google does quite a bit more than your basic search engine when it comes to ranking google has implemented the pagerank in short pagerank enhances the algorithm by taking into account the of a given at this may be judged by any number of factors that google just wont tell at the most basic of google can tell that one page is more important than another because loads and loads of other pages link to

you want to use of a tag as just a label or a name for a particular it is very helpful in my experience to tag important milestones in a whether for production release or even for interim qa you often will want to go back in time and see the source code for a particular you branch upon you can always figure out which revision was released to but this is kind of a pain compared to just looking at a if you use release branches then it will be easy to lose track of which revision was used to create a particular problem with svn is that it blurs the distinction between tags and anyone can always commit to a so not guaranteed to be in other vcs like a is you can adopt a team convention to prevent commits to or even maybe use commit hooks to prevent commits to	
you want to use you can do what chris porter suggested by wrapping each td content in matching anchor then set the anchor tags to and set the and to be the same as the you should then find that the touch seamlessly and the effect is that the whole row is watch out for padding on the which will cause gaps in the clickable apply padding to the anchor tags as it will form part of the clickable area if you do also like to set the row up to have a highlight effect by applying a different background color on the latest bootstrap some quick css to show how this can be tbody tr td tbody tr td a a sample table to work showing this in

your coworkers that their perl looks too much like line please obfuscate your code just for the sake of obfuscation asinine development goals like that which give perl such a bad reputation for being when really bad programmers like your who write sloppy nicely and logical code is a good c is a good though the best place to figure out how to write perl is in the best by damian it tells you how he thinks you should do and he always gives good reasons for his position as well as occasionally giving good reasons to i do disagree with him on some but his reasoning is the odds that you work with anyone who knows perl better than conway are pretty and having a printed book at least a safari gives you some more solid backing for your pick up a copy of the perl cookbook while at as looking at code examples for solving common problems should get you on the right i hate to say the but those are exceptionally good books that perl developer should regards to your specific using split with no it looks plenty to my eyes which have been developing with perl for quite a one though i hate the english if you must use do it like english the option slows down regexp parsing and the variables it provides usually

your users can execute the decryptandrun then they can read it any files it needs to read such as decryption so they can just extract the code to decrypt the scripts could work around this by making the decrtyptandrun but then any bug in it could lead to the user getting root privileges at least privileges to the account that holds the decryption so probably not a good and of if gone to all the trouble of hiding the contents or keys of these decryption scripts by making them not readable to the then why you do the same with the contents of the scripts trying to you have a interpreted executable as an interpreter for another interpreted one of the fundamental rules of cryptography invent your own encryption algorithm unless an experienced leads me to wonder why you feel the need to encrypt scripts that your users will be is there anything wrong with them seeing the contents of the
