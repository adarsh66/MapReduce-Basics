3 mvc layers are really only applicable from the standpoint of the user interface so the two additional layers that you note are really part of the a ddd driven you would have your controllers call out to an application service that would handle checking with the security layer if the action is authorized and then either executing the action against your business layer core domain model or returning back an type message back to the instead of using the application service you can just have the controller call directly to the business logic layer which does the security checking internally out to the security but depending on how complex your business logic it may be less clear to have it intermixed with your authorization checks to the security	
32 byte chunks means that the ratio between data and overhead is terrible you have your pointer in the linked list and at least much the same again from the memory i would strongly suggest allocating a much larger chunk of memory and grow it exponentially to fit and see if this causes only if you encounter problems would i go the linked list

a b can convert b to negative value using negation and adding c a is complement sign processor is doing it when you use operator when you want to negate value or subtrackt float is just negate first bit gave you example how to do i give here is my compiler independent int int unsigned int unsigned int loop unsigned int sum unsigned int while ai a bi b ci sum sum sum ai add bit of a and and add carry bit stored in sum loop loop if sum add carry return int int unsigned int return add negation 1 complement unsigned int a unsigned int b printf function compiler independent return using unsigned int so that any compiler will treat it the you want to subtract negative then do it that unsgined int negative15 we are completly independent of signed values in my approach result all ints will be stored as complement so you have to be careful with bigger ints have to start with 0

a class is various static data about the class is stored in as long as a live reference to this class instance the class instance cannot be garbage believe that part of the problem has to do with whether or not the gc should remove old class instances from perm or every time you hot new class instances are added to the permgen memory and the old now are typically not by the sun jvms will not run garbage collection in but this can be enabled with optional command if you hot deploy enough you will eventually exhaust your permgen your web app does not shut down when undeployed if it leaves a thread for example then all of the class instances used by that web app will be pinned in the permgen you redeploy and now have another whole copy of all of these class instances loaded into you undeploy and the thread keeps pinning another set of class instances in you redeploy and load a whole net set of and eventually your permgen fills can sometimes fix this command arguments to a recent sun jvm to enable gc in permgen and of that a different jvm that employ a fixed sized permgen or that does gc on loaded this will help if your web app shuts down completely and leaving no live references to any of the class instances of any class loaded by the class loaders for that web this will not necessarily fix the due to class loader well as too many interned strings in some out the following links for more two bolded ones have nice diagrams to illustrate part of the the dreaded permgen unknown permgen outofmemoryerror the permanent permgen errors how to deal with out of memory

actually think this is a pretty good there are a few ways of looking at this could be seen negatively for one one thing you can do in a normal interview to sort the wheat from the chaff is ask them what they know about your company and the good that are keen to work for you and generally eager and have looked you up and at least gone to your website you have and found out what it is you so by asking them this upfront you are losing the opportunity to see how much initiative they of course you make up for this in other areas eg by asking questions that a reasonable person may have looked up other potential negative is that it can often be hard to understand an a business or a product from the outside looking i worked in for and not until you get to a place like that that you can see all the different teams new call centre and so and get an understanding of what they do and why they do understadning the culture is also hard without being a part of brann is right in that you want someone who is capable of understanding it rather than someone who actually you might be excluding good potential hires who will pick up your business quite being i like where going with the forcing a candidate to think about things like that is a good perhaps you could narrow the focus to a single aspect of your which is more digestable in a typically this will also allow you to give you the opportunity to see how much initative they took beyond the scope of the original

advantage of png is full alpha which allows you to have smooth edges and shadows in in web the main disadvantage is that it only supports lossless which for complex images means a very large file on the other hand offers great compressibility for complex but no seen flash elements with highly compressed images that also have smoothed edges and i know much about flash and have no idea how this is this is basically the effect i would like to be able to do a complex image with transparent shadowed questions does lossy compression with transparency work in there flash specific layering tricks being used are the shadows generated or rasterized into the image as i would do with a there any swfs or swf generating scripts that could replace a png image with a lossily compressed thinking progressive enhancement to improve loading speed of certain design if this would it be feasible to write there any formats that allow lossy compression with been hard for me to find specific info on djvu might be a should we be pushing browser makers to support another there other solutions to this everything in flash or accepting enormous file sizes are the current some other and canvas may be able to apply but supported by could cut up a png along scan lines and compress those with leaving the edges as this would be nasty in but it would work in all sounds like a fun write it by the could write a lossy image filter that can decrease color complexity along the png scan lines to improve compression within the png i just this had to but i find anyone know of for your image plus for the

agree with charlie about tests corresponding more to user actions and the correctness of the system as a i do think there is alot more value to unit tests than just localizing failures more tightly unit tests provide two main values over integration writing unit tests is as much an act of design as if you practice test driven driven development the act of writing the unit tests helps you design exactly what you code should it helps you write higher quality code being loosely coupled helps with and it helps you write just enough code to make your tests pass your tests are in effect your the second value of unit tests is that if they are properly written they are very very if i make a change to a class in your project can i run all the corresponding tests to see if i broke how do i know which tests to and how long will they i can guarantee it will be longer than well written unit you should be able to run all of you unit tests in a couple of minutes at the

am curious about the technology behind a search engine like from what i could it host any torrent but rather connects you to other servers that search for it brings up a list of potential titles matching your you pick one of these and it provides you with another list of potential servers hosting the corresponding torrent interested in particularly is the strategy behind gathering and indexing all that do they collect then aggregate the it a submission base where each of these servers submits its content for it a crawling if so how do you even start crawling a site like they have access to these other knowledge and understanding of the bittorrent protocol is not very but the documentation that i found online pointed me more toward the processes involved in building a tracker which exactly what interested any insight and recommended reading material is do you build a torrent file

am in a similar working on a web app that is targeted at it and required to support the same set of minus general things learned so in as many of your target browsers as you make sure you have time for this in your development can get you part of the way to but will eventually miss something on some plan some time for debugging and researching fixes for specific you need something not in a toolkit and find a free code invest some time to write utility functions that encapsulate the yourself about known browser so that you can steer your implementation around few things conditional code based on the only as a last because different generations of the browser may have different test for behavior first then common functions and if you look at the for a specific browser type version when the dom is for script access is different in just about every a good toolkit will abstract this for handlers are different in just about every a good toolkit will abstract this for dom particularly form controls or elements with can be tricky with and while not standard kinda using with strings that contain bits of html seems to be more reliable across browser i have yet to find a toolkit that will let you use to add a to a form element in differences are just as important as js javascript features array seem to be pretty reliable and consistent across especially relative to the some small joy in the fact that the language entirely different on every really run into any js but always one of the first browsers i

application often connects to different king of over web proprietary over and other kids of we already have a number of implementations that let us connect from our application to these and while all of these implementations implement the common java they do not share anything have realized that there are signification portions of code that are common for all of these particular connector implementations and we have decided to streamline the development of future connectors through one universal this connector will be capable of formatting messages to a format expected by and sending them using the available transport for message format over mq or over of the dilemmas we are facing is the most appropriate technology for this kind of so our connectors were basic java classes that implement the common java since we generally host our applications in some java ee application it seems that java connector architecture would be the most appropriate technology for this piece of implementing jca compliant connector seems to be relatively what are the palpable benefits of going with the standard jca and do benefits justify additional are the benefits of	
are a couple of ways this can be code running at does not need to be written in the same language as the it merely has to be able to be linked together with os virtually all languages can interoperate with which is really all there is technically no java functions can call c and c functions can call java and if the os written in c for the sake of argument that written in then the os code can call into some intermediate c which forwards to your and vice c is pretty much a of a program has been compiled native its source language is no longer assembler looks much the same regardless of which language the source code was written in before as long as you use the same calling convention as the no bigger problem is runtime not a lot of software services are available in the there usually is no java virtual for is no reason why there technically but but safe to assume that not in its as java a java program a lot of it needs the java vm to interpret and jit the and it needs the class library and so there are two ways around java in the this would be an unusual but it could be compile your java source code to a native a java program have to be compiled to java you could compile it to x86 the same goes for whatever class libraries you those too could be compiled all the way to of parts of the java class library requires certain os features that be but then use of those classes could be it can be but not and unclear what course another problem may be that java let you access arbitrary memory which would make a lot of hardware communication pretty but that could be worked around perhaps by calling into very simple c functions which simply return the relevant memory areas as arrays for java to work

as probably is that got one form inside another form ie the legacy form is appearing inside the form required by the master quick rather way to get around this is to close the form above the legacy and then open a new form below the legacy this means got three forms on the none of which are you end up with something like closing tag at the start closes the from the master you then have your which should now work as then the open tag at the end simply ensures that the closing tag from the master page is valid anything appearing on the master page after the legacy form be within the standard so this may not work for you depending on how the rest of your page is not a particularly elegant but it works as a quick fix on what else is on your master used it where we had one legacy form required on a site with hundreds of so we simply wanted a fix rather than anything that affected the master page our we change the legacy form as this was supplied by a regularly and needed to be dropped into the page without a developer getting involved to amend it as opposed to solution to his own question which requires editing the form and is clearly a better option in his case and probably in most other cases where there is a similar

be careful that the program is in the not just the perl binaries and core programs usually end up in but others may end up in the site specific directory the command aid your make sure your reflects your are two common at least that i know to run a perl program from the windows command first is to create a batch version of the program with which will execute with the installed programs usually do this automatically because and take care of second is to create a file this is done by creating the registry key if for the current user and set the value you can call programs just by naming them with the now you can invoke the program with may have noticed that you can call a program on windows without the the program is searched for in the but when no is used to complete the append to the and you can invoke the program just with note that the order in this list is important for the just as the order in usually take care of the last two but this knowledge is useful if like to add your own or need to fix	
be honest i still prefer and with ajax extensions it is my point of still the most versatile and best framework for creating tried mvc and many other but the ability to create good web application with pure still beats the is so things just unlike many others where you keep hitting your head against the wall due to some stupid or feature no possible to it comes to dividing the business logic and data logic i still would say unless you need a divided ui as is still the right the dividing of and ui is good enough for most people tend to yell out that mvc is much better when it comes to maybe but untill now managed to do without complications just as well with mvc and without more like instead of trying to blame it on the try asking we testing the right stuff the a good and be creating easy to code web note i usually receive from my which i ship to india for slicing and receive static after a short up and running with my coded solution on the new easy as on the other it might just be because i know the most

because your lambda expression contains an the function is now by definition whether the assignment is related to one of the arguments or another object defined outside the current function is a function must have no whatsoever in order to be called see for a more precise quite which details the two conditions a function must satisfy to be deemed no is one of i believe lambda expressions are typically meant to be used as pure functions least i would imagine they were originally studied as such from the mathematical though clearly stringent about where purely functional languages so probably not bad though definitely worth being away that such a function is	
been a few years since shopped for a this may be out of find it interesting that nobody has really defined other than to say more vibrant lcd panels fall into one of two reproduction panels and response time tn panels consider sips and similar panels a must for development for one crucial look the image change colors or do other weird things as you angle to the screen very important for the high end of this scale are monitors that are designed to perform will with color most developers need anything this panels are decent for and other things featuring fast they are optimized for pixel response and usually the main feature touted for these many cheaper panels are going to be of this a i look for four type or more than pitch good go with a small dot is too light black is and how i love i must admit that any lcd monitor that can meet criteria above would be a good even if a cheaper tn

been teaching a class on unit refactoring and so and this is probably the thing that most people get refactoring is just changing the it is changing the code without changing the external functional that is a very important other you need to have some way to verify that the external functional behavior is intact after the lacking divine insight i find unit tests very useful for in his book on martin fowler stresses the use of automated tests for this your code was developed using tdd you will have the necessary test suite as it is developed during the development of the code if you need to refactor code for which no tests are your best approach would be to set up automated tests before you make any changes to the i realize that setting up tests for existing code can be but you will learn a lot about the code while doing may also want to check essay on strong typing versus strong as it discusses the feedback you get from the compiler versus the feedback you get from your test

best suggestion is probably what parashift but read my caution note below as well parashift faq how can i handle a that an have a return so not possible to use the best way to constructor failure is therefore throw an if you the option of using is to put object into a state setting an internal status bit so object acts sort of like even though it is technically idea of a object has lot of you need to add query member function check this bit so users your class can find out if object is truly or if zombie a and just about every place construct one of your within a larger object an array of you need to that status flag via an if also want to add an if to other member if the is a do a or something more practice the thing pretty certainly you prefer exceptions over zombie but if you do not have the option using zombie objects be the word of caution with throwing exceptions in a very careful though because if an exception is thrown in a the destructor is not so you need to be careful about destructing objects that you already constructed before the exception is the same warnings apply to exception handling in but it is maybe a little less obvious when dealing with a virtual after exception is d public p new throw so p causes a memory char char b p new return constructors with createinstance way around this is to make your constructor private or protected and make a createinstance method that can return	
best way for you to learn c is to put in practice the topics you are example if you are going through basic principles like looping and if you can build yourself a little program that simulates the functionality of counting changes on a vending you move on to more advanced topics like pointers and data structures you can build a logo like the user can input each step of the and you can store that in a linked afterwards you can perform pointer operations on your data structure by or adding the idea is to start coding to test what you you will find that some of the time you really understand even though it seemed clear in the as a good programmer you will end up having to revisit the topics until you actually know

biggest challenge with a lot of the billing systems is that you either end up with a lot of coding to do or they come up short with one or more critical systems such as paypal handle externally driven recurring billing for security you as a customer can agree to a subscription from a but paypal has to handle everyone having to have a paypal or googlecheckout account to conduct business may be a depending on your the traditional merchant systems like authorizenet and linkpoint give you more but you might have a lot of coding to do to push the transactions through the way you depending on your not to mention more overhead in setting up the account in the first flexible payments stands somewhere in the offering more flexibility than but still having the third party account since doing a tool that manages relationships to their you may benefit from ability to facilitate transactions between two external done development in this space using java or ruby on ruby on rails has a wonderful gem built by the people at shopify called that makes credit card processing pretty simple once you have opened your merchant account with one of the type of most of the merchant providers have decent java apis as you may want to look at something like for since it lets you put together pretty invoices and has an cloud a big fan and it lets you manage the costs of scaling more it does require in many cases that you solve problems of clustering and failover more for tasks such as batch billing that can be run through something like amazon this an you bring up what you throw it in the black and get the result for something that requires continuous such as the web you will want to evaluate whether be cheaper to run a cluster of webapp servers in the cloud or just run 1 or 2 boxes at a managed data center such as the planet or the right answer for you depends in part on the expertise you have available and the for the continuous uptime you may also want to look at a provider such as that will host a rails app in the reply if anything i said requires further

classes are fine as long as used in the right methods that are methods do not modify they merely transform the input good examples of this are things like these sorts of things are useful and make for terser i have with statics are if you have static dependencies are consider the static class public static void public static void public static void static class private static public static new graphicsformat in do something to create loading classes for all supported formats or some other contrived public static texture return how do we know that resourceloader is valid at this var texture return public static cleanup code at you cannot tell what initialisation steps must be carried out by looking at a you must delve into the class to find its dependencies and initialise things in the correct in this it needs the resourceloader to be initialised before now scale up this dependency nightmare and you can probably guess what will imagine trying to maintain code where there is no explicit order of contrast this with dependency injection with instances in that case the code even if the dependencies are not if you use statics that modify like a house of you never know who has access to and the design tends to resemble a spaghetti and just as using statics ties a program to a specific static code is the antithesis of designing for testing code that is riddled with statics is a a static call can never be swapped for a test double you use testing frameworks specifically designed to mock out static so a static system causes everything that uses it to be an instant integration statics are fine for some things and for small tools or throwaway code i discourage their beyond they are a bloody nightmare for good design and ease of a good article on the

code from an existing application and made a new one from is a bad cloning is very it seems cheap to for the entire service life of these you have more than doubled the maintenance every bug in the original must also be located in the clone and thought about and do not do i consider it as a hint that people need to find a job that involve documentation is out of sync with existing code so didnt rely on is a consequence of it is a good reason why cloning an application is a bad it leads to documentation that match either the original app or the cloned time for poc as there are deadlines to mislead the project manager about how much time the project would your job to provide a design based on your understanding of the if going to build one application that does both if it is a clone of another applciation to see if everything little late for you should have had some test cases must earlier in the first is but during the development is almost as after the fact is well hard to manage and creates the design document to reflect the is way too late in the process to be of any design comes then test plans and procedures unit test code shows up that conforms to the design and passes the unit

control is useful only when you are running an interactive you know that stdin and stdout are connected to a terminal device on it makes sense to have something on something else on on the other have such scripts can be made and run without any terminal it make sense to have foreground or background processes in this run other commands on the background to the command and capture their pids with then you use to kill or suspend them or on the it the shell was you can also use of to wait for the background process to

depends on the regular expression itself if it is efficient or what it makes inefficient is and to avoid the regular expression has to be as distinct as take the regular expression as an example and apply it to the string the algorithm will first match the literal in to the in next the expression will be in the normal greedy where multipliers are expanded to the it will match to the whole rest in than the last literal in will be but as the end of the string is already reached and a mulpliplier is in the algorithm will try backtracking to match the whole the match of will be decreased by one character and the algorithm tries to comply the rest of the but the in match the in so will be decreased by one more character until it matches the empty string is repeated zero and the in matches the in you can applied to needs 6 backtracking approaches for until the whole regular expression but if we alter the regular expression and make it distinct by using there is be no backtracking necessary and the regular expression can be matches within the first if you now consider using lazy modifiers to tell that this rules apply to every both the greedy and lazy the difference is instead of first expanding the match to the maximum and than doing backtracking by decreasing the match one character at a time the lazy modifiers will first be expanded to the minimum match and than be increased one character at a

developing a class library to be used for other developers and will be allowing them to either declare an instance of my class using withevents similar in other as well as allow them to use delegates defined in the am i just being redundant here by doing it like delegate sub sender as byval e as event sender as byval e as as timerelapseddelegate should i just declare the events and let them do the for any advice on this i think being redundant and want pointless not to mention avoiding the dry wanted to post the remainder of the and stress that the an instance of this class performs is done on a separate delegate sub sender as byval e as event sender as byval e as as timerelapseddelegate property as return end value as if value is nothing if is nothing end end end sub if ontimerelapsed isnot nothing new end raiseevent new delegate sub sender as byval e as event sender as byval e as as itemreadyforqueuedelegate property as return end value as if value is nothing if is nothing end end end sub oitem as if onitemreadyforqueue isnot nothing new end raiseevent new class inherits private as public readonly property as return end end public sub oreporttemplate as end delegates and declaring

did some benchmarks in an article about peter zaitsev done a simple benchmark to see performance of query row point standard prepared and have it served from query prepared statements give which is better than 2000 with statements but it is still well 4470 when results served from query seems to say that the of using prepared statements is that they are than using a straight query at least in this simple the relative difference probably diminishes with a more complex query or a larger result seems that prepared queries would be given the double to the server and other benchmark lacks you should run your own because the type of query you and your environment and are definitely important for query it was true in the past that prepared statements were incompatible with caching query but this was see the query cache in the mysql mysql statements do not use the query beginning with statements use the query cache certain which depending on the preparation documentation goes on to describe these go read do recommend using prepared statements for quoting variables as you interpolate them into sql statements can be effective if you do it but even quoting may have some subtle security with character sets mysql bug easier to use prepared queries in a secure way in these

dynamic sql can be more efficient for the some of the comments here seem to endorse my view that dynamic sql can be confusing to the human especially when they write the code of the person who will inherit your prefer static sql in a and make the call to the proc dynamic at runtime by choosing appropriate if you use sql ddl to define the proc you can specify values for the parameters so the caller can simply omit the ones that are not needed see if you can follow the logic in this procedure integer integer integer from db where col1 is and col2 is and col3 is it may not yield the best execution plan but imo you have to balance optimization against good design principles it runs really quick on my machine

every answer has to avoid the declare the function before its and as chris points use the standard mechanisms for accessing the variadic arguments or suffer the pains of undefined this it is not that the declaration before use in this case is required because of the return but rather because it does not match the default signature for an undeclared that a function taking unspecified arguments returning an the actual definition is different from the assumed declaration which causes gcc to say types for second example return because the later definition of contradict the default signature assumed when its first call was but just because it works make it good form because you get almost no type safety from the default to the variadic arguments ones matching the really should be done through the standard mechanisms of unless you are implementing a compiler and are the author of that for on some architectures those arguments may not even be passed on the but they can still be located by the macros from i reworded the second paragraph to say what i meant in a and i hope compiler needs to know that the function is variadic the first call because on some it might be required to pass the variadic parameters differently than normal that is especially true of certain risk and those that might pass the first 2 ints and first 2 floats in but must put all variadics on the stack even if there is room in the similar declare before use situation exists for functions that do not use the calling you will usually run into this when linking modules written in pascal or fortran with modules written in many of the windows api functions exported by the core dlls assume a calling convention named and if the compiler were to use a style the program would crash the whole machine on windows 9x or

example the decision whether to use or involve any kind of has a net benefit any there are many similar scenarios and any discussion in these realms are a waste of i believe very important to know what the target compiler is capable of optimizing small code the truth modern compilers are good at jason has an concerning an optimized factorial the other compilers can be surprisingly stupid as the key is that many optimizations require a control flow analysis which becomes np ever optimization thus becomes a between compilation time and the locality of an optimization plays a crucial role because the computation time required to perform the optimization increases just too much when the code size regarded by the compiler increases by just a few as others have these minute details are still relevant and always will be the forseeable although compilers get smarter all the time and machines get so does the size of our data grow in losing this particular in many the amount of data grows much faster than computers get

feminella is on the right track by iterating once through the i think sorting has a few young says the array be and as pax points out no sort is going to have better performance than iterating over the array interested in why one method is faster than another you might read about o in computer science this is used to describe the growth rate of functions and estimate their running functions will generally be faster than higher order and this is usually written in terms of the number of elements or example the iteration that john proposed is described as and is written as we only go through the array once and it has sorting always requires more over the years a lot of smart people have come up with sorting algorithms that improve but they all have higher growth rates and are higher order than for instance array is and the wikipedia page for has a table with many more may not need it for this but i hope helpful in the future when you do need to do expensive operations like

finally figured this reporting services 2005 blog post has almost everything that i but going to post the full answer here for ended up using the report viewer object behind the but only for since not first step is asking the user for the printer doc as new addressof dialog as new print as we proceed to configure our report this you can get to print on any paper size and any orientation height and width for but the report itself must be configured in the same page deviceinfo as string as as path as encoding filenameextension we render the report with all its that if the report has only one the renderstream method is never is the report viewer previously configured and aiming at a server allso that in this code we add pages to a this list is a global since needed in the printpagehandler as each pagename as string in data we done any printing at this is actually handled by the printpagehandler method that we referenced pages as new pageindex as integer sub sender as byval e as dim page as metafile pageindex pageindex

foo is not smalltalk a recent addition designed to make it practical to code in prior to that there was no dedicated syntax to declare since they would be created by a command in the interpreting this code as you expected would be wrong for a couple if was a real message sent to then should resolve to which is not possible since it is just being behind the the compiler does something similar where is a symbol for the name of a new class to be it would be possible to write all code like except then you could not use class names directly they exist yet when the code is you would have to do new all over the so the whole form foo is pure syntax that just declares that this class should be and does not mean that at this moment a message should be sent to you want to create classes in the middle of an algorithm and send them messages that would be pretty ugly as a development note that classes have to be registered in the system so that the browser can display that the compiler can automatically recompile that the version control can record what if your code accidentally runs this should you get a second class foo and forget about the previous only the and other tools create new and only at the

function does not cause the current thread to yield and does not release the all it does is restart one thread that has suspended itself on the condition via this just means the awakened thread is available for it cause it to execute the will schedule it sometime in the just because the has been awakened and is contending for the that mean going to get the mutex mutexes are not necessarily fair to all threads that have requested according to the man locks the given if the mutex is currently it becomes locked and owned by the calling and returns so the can spin in its loop several happily unlocking and relocking the mutex several times before being swapped out by the this means the will only get a chance at the mutex if the scheduler happens to interrupt the during the brief time in which it has released the achieve the output you both threads will need to control their execution with a condition and signal each other before suspending this may or may not be what you actually want to do with your real it really matter what order you created the threads creating a thread does not yield the creating so the main thread will probably create both threads before either gets and the thread scheduler is free to schedule either one of them for execution if the does run first on your that just happens to be the implementation behavior on your platform and is not something that should be relied

going to add some words of advice about using a trigger for it is possible to do this with a unlike i think it should be a database issue because all records will need the uniqueness not just ones added through a specific putting logic like this in the application is a bad idea from the standpoint of data ata minumum make sure the filed has a unique most inexperienced trigger developers think that triggers work on each row individually and do not design their trigger to handle multiple row you may think that there are no multiple row you would most of the time be at some point you are going to want to import a group of the trigger must be able to handle using your it can handle only one record at a this is a huge flaw because the only way to handle it in a trigger is through the use of a cursor or while this is extremely slow and could end up locking up your customer table for hours if you have the need to add a lot of customers all at think idea of creating a pool of possible unique passwords is a good one because then you can use logic in the trigger to fill it but to work it you would need three columns identity field to use for grabbing the next 300 rows for you should also schedule a nightly job to generate more potential passwords if the number unused is below a certain that way things will never fail because you unexpectedly ran out of potential

got the idea of column families right basically just a hint to hbase to store and replicate these items together for faster you put two column families in the same table and always have different keys to access then really the same thing as having them in two separate you only gain by having two column families in the same table that are accessed via the same if i have columns for the total number of pageviews for a given web the number of unique views for the same the browser the user uses to view the and their internet i can decide that i want the first two to be a column family and the last two to be another column here all four are accessed by the same namely the web site in so gaining by having them in the same in different tables i would end up having to do a operation on the two i really know the numbers though so i really tell you how slow the operation is i recall hbase having a join since and what the tipping point is where splitting them into separate tables outweighs having them in the same table vice this all depends on the data trying to so if you would never need to join across the you would want to keep them in separate tables since you could argue not that related to each other in the first

had a similar compiler that implemented a bizarre version of the we had which would call constructors for us and destructors were called most the vendor went and implemented and using and as a to the the problem was that they never mentioned that a would not cause destructors of local objects to be our group inherited the code base after someone wrote an application acting like it was standard using raii techniques and all of the other we ended up rewriting it in what a number of us call you might want to consider just biting the bullet and writing in straight instead of have an explicitly called initialization destructors become an explicitly called termination there much of that you mimic in c pretty mi is a pain in the but single inheritance is pretty take a look at for some it almost describes the approach that we i really wish i had written our method down

handlers are traditionally called with the elements registered to as context this is what jquery easiest option for you would be to use ability to handle event myclass is the initial call updatesum with correct does something other possibility is to use closures to define the updatehandler inside the myclass save this as that so we can access it from the anonymous var that does something is a working example what one of the other answers tried to it works because the anonymous function can always access the variables in the surrounding function but it only works if the function is really defined in the function that has as local

have a application written in a small but growing amount of it has evolved over the years with many features you would expect in a large files that make it hard to isolate testable that are too complex to be easily this code is targeted for embedded a lot of overhead to run it on the actual so we would like to do more of our development and testing in quick on a local but we would like to avoid the classic strategy of into a file on your fix if developers are going to to go the trouble to do like to be able to recreate the same tests and run in an automated our in order to refactor the code to be more we need it to be more but in order to introduce automated unit we need it to be more problem is that since our files are so we might have a function inside a file that calls a function the same that we need to stub out to make a good unit it seems like this would be less of a problem as our code gets more but that is a long way thing we thought about doing was tagging to be source code with then we could write a script scan source files for testable compile it in a separate and link it with the unit we could slowly introduce the unit tests as we fix defects and add more there is concern that maintaining this scheme with all the required stub will become too much of a and developers will stop maintaining the unit so another approach is to use a tool that automatically generates stubs for all the and link the file with only tool we have found that will do this is an expensive commercial but this approach seems to that all our code be more modular before we can even since only the external calls can be stubbed i would rather have developers think about their external dependencies and intelligently write their own but this could be overwhelming to stub out all the dependencies for a horribly line it might be difficult to convince developers that they need to maintain stubs for all their external but is that the right way to do other argument heard is that the maintainer of a subsystem should maintain the stubs for their but i wonder if developers to write their own stubs would lead to better unit of add another whole dimension to the have looked at several based unit test and there are a lot of options that look but we have not found anything to ease the transition from of code with no unit to here are my questions to anyone else who has been through is a good starting are we going in the right or are we missing something tools might be useful to help with the since our budget right now is roughly our build environment is so we use any do you introduce unit testing into a legacy

have a few each with their particular inner new public void actionevent implements public void actionevent class implements private final outerclass public outerclass target public void actionevent implements class implements public void actionevent somewhere else in the way has good and bad to anonymous inner class will not allow you to do what you are it can only implement one other three will all allow you to do what you want add windowlistener to the implements list for you likely want the inner class or outer class implementing the listener way to do what you i suggest that because the listener is likely very highly coupled to your and you will need to do a large set of statements to figure out which control was acted on to perform the actual action use to figure out which control was being acted on and then comare it to your instance variables to see which it unless you are in memory constrained such as an android you probably should not do one method for all listeners as it can easily lead to very bad if memory is an then go for but if it you are better of doing one of the following listener class per listener class per event type for all listener class per control per event prefer to code the following i find it to be the most class extends private final jbutton private final jbutton buttona new buttonb new do not put these in the constructor unless the outer class is public void private void private void public void implements public void actionevent public void implements public void actionevent prefer this way because it forces the methods out of the which means i only have one place to look for the code scattered throughout the inner it also means that it is possible that and can be reused if the code is in a listener that practical is but not worth the it the above way is also and i prefer consistency over most things unless there is a good reason not do for instance on the android i do not do that since class creation is expensive still have the listener call methods but the class itself implements the listeners and i do an if

have an interesting problem coming up soon and started to think about the the more i think about the more i get frightened because i think going to scale horribly unless i can get having trouble getting smart about this a simplified description of the have n polygons n can be huge that are stored as a list of m vertices m is on the order of what i need to do is for each polygon create a list of any vertices that are shared among other polygons of the polygons as surrounding regions of sometimes the regions but up against each i see something like i vertex polygon j 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 5 3 1 6 3 1 7 3 mean that vertex 1 in polygon 1 is the same point as vertex 2 in polygon and vertex 2 in polygon 1 is the same point as vertex 3 in polygon likewise vertex 5 in polygon 1 is the same as vertex 1 in polygon we can assume that polygons never the closest they get is touching at the and that all the vertices are integers make the equality easy to only thing i can thing of right now is for each polygon i have to loop over all of the polygons and vertices giving me a scaling of which is going to be very bad in my i can have very large files of so i even store it all in so that would mean multiple reads of the my pseudocode so to for j to for to for to if end end end assuming that this has come up in the graphics community spend much time so i know the any shared vertices among

have been getting more and more sick of all the quirks about control trying to get your data in serverside on i seem to spend more time fighting with controls in that i think it takes me more time than i gain by using was thinking about using plain with jquery and a web service that returns json for the only thing i think i would miss from webforms is the the session authentication based on windows login and possibly they have some quirks maybe not for sessions and but i have never developped there something wrong with the am thinking about i think about there things in that i will miss anyone done this before and wants to share experience also take that i only have the framework available for the kind of things giving me troubles in that makes me wonder for the is a sample of a page giving me is a tree table can edit fields on each child you press the save the data from the group row must be updated data from a no modification in data from the child want to refresh the whole page because the displayed records are based from search master details are generated using to update a record from code behind is really and still have no clue about updating the jquery and a web my guess would be that i could update directly to the request what i want to be displayed and just update that this is the kind of things that make me wonder if is just getting in my some details about group childrecord some editable fields savebutton childrecord some editable fields savebutton childrecord some editable fields savebutton childrecord some editable fields savebutton some details about group some details about group problem i have about is not related to i use jquery to make the interfaces more dynamic like showing hiding the search section when not needed and collapsing details from the but this is all i do with bothers me is that if i want to check which button has been clicked in this i have to use some tricks that feel a bit you want to use databound comboboxes in a you have to use codebehind to set the selected it will be a pain to retreive the data if you want to check what data was you have to save the datatable in the read data from all controls in the then compare with the datatable to make an this is this kind of things that bother me with of switching from to bread butter

have never written software for and i doubt that is a good candidate for you never know when the garbage collector will pause your programs for an unknown amount of time before it returns the execution to your program like nothing you tell us more about the type of and the type of operations you expect to do with the the slowest part with a list is probably the resize of the underlying array that occurs when you add more items that it was originally created you can get away with this by using the constructor that accepts an integer as the initial if you can calculate that stay away from some of the methods like they aint as fast as they sound

have suggested very good ways to prevent your css from affecting the as well as making sure that your css takes but you seem most concerned with the css affecting you that adding a unexpected style making all divs have a pink only way i can think for you to prevent their styling from affecting your injected code would be for you to sandbox what like in an otherwise simply too many things that have to define have to define every single style the list goes on and on the selector better so you just override your own just so that you can guarantee absolute control over your i realize that the latter solution necessarily be too if using the to reset everything to a found who has written up such a if you scroll down far enough on the see it it look but is a good start for would be interested to know if a good way to prevent written greasemonkey scripts before that injects code onto the and have had to write css to override the but in those cases i knew who my target was and could tailor my css directly towards the

hinges here on the agreed upon definition of hack hack coder hacker cracker script kiddie jedi cyberpunk ninja code monkey reverse engineer criminal mischevious person felon convicted felon suspected felon mastermind chaotic good characters chaotic evil doers dictators emperor insurgent terrorist agents neo copyright violators copy writers spammers marketers telemarketers spyware creators computer virus for programmers necessarily have done hacking in the rebelled against the but were though not technically law great programmers certainly associate themselves as being a hacker in the romantic cyberpunk sense of the however being a hacker does not imply a lack of morals or hackers may find that their conscience does not prohibit them from executing technological deeds that the general societal concensus may deem as questionable at best or worse reprehensible or worst literally flat out free will does of engineers and crackers are usually better than your average hacker at i would never hire anyone who at least know how to do some reverse it is necessarily a part of being a good from my then i consider myself a fairly veteran and have seen an abnormally high number of instances that completely justify reverse engineering for corporate gain the avoidance of corporate have never had a problem not doing things that i know i if i wanted free time is a good instant reward for moderate amounts of who wants to go out of way to break come i have never identified what makes a criminal organization except for the profit depends on what you consider what you what you all hackers are in the vast majority are intent on remaining a hardened criminal is probably not going to be someone you want to but it depends on your first of you may not even have the choice to hire a convicted felon depending on your industry or for your are you in again if you are dealing specifically with security and and it is virtually a requirement that you truly are smart as a and that you have the salt to outsmart foxes should you be given a chance to accept such a masterminds would never get if they ever got they would have lost their prior status as a masterminds could be criminals but not and probably need to be hired by you for your measly some good masterminds probably are out i know do want those you want the you want you want you want vast gobs and gobs of you want people who can fix any problem and are undeterred by you want people who know that anything truly is just intelligent systems of logic consider all so never going to find smart people to work for you who have not even considered doing something wrong in their entire you are looking for law abiding citizens to work for it is best to look for people who at least portray outwardly some behavior that seems to imply an internal value system that generally jives with what you think of as you never know what is going on in just because someone has never been caught does not mean that everything that they do in their personal life is perfectly legal or ethical or but there are probably want to hire people who are doing very bad things even on their own what you consider to be very bad things may a called may not be illegal in your but could still be for for for for for for the continuum for god for the for for for for for for dungeons and dragons you want to hire people who fit your whether you be government or some sort of a crime consider myself sort of hat i have done black hat kinds of things never gotten and plan on engaging in those kinds of activities on a regular anything in your personal or professional life that people could blackmail you for or put you behind bars for is generally dumb all the way whether you are a criminal or a jedi or just looking to hire people or collecting information that could be used to blackmail people is the worst and certainly far worse than breaking into any have worked in carrier scale job banking and have had access to extremely ridiculous amounts of extremely sensitive data and have written apps against that i get to do that by being a dodo brain in the first you should have access to lots of data is kind of like asking whether or not you should have the one ring from the the lord of the only those who you know have no interest in using it should have high levels of have felt comfortable having been given official professional access to lots and lots of data on the premise that i could spider most of it myself anyways off the internet for were i ever in a real mostly why what me who the type of person who use the one even if i had why usually i have had to share the burden of being on the side of good and have had to hope that the baddies never got in and have had to try my hardest to make sure how things have tended to really a baddie anyway i would like to think of you as my and not my i want to see you to go to jail for anything you did with some ones and and with some if you ever directly or indirectly knowingly put lives or liberties in whether in the name of the empire or in the name of the shame on do the fact there are lots of systems on which the safety of lives directly no bad people should be running those no people who could ever turn bad should be running those think about should anyone have the keys to the systems know who to build a truly secure trust no one not even

i want to run a query on one of my users where i want a row stored and associated with that in a so say is just an arbitrary that i have a table that keeps track of a along with some info about the each user can have either 0 or 1 if the user has no there is no entry in the table for that table just an when i update this i always end up doing something like this select from cars where update cars set where insert into cars values can i make this into one elegant statement that works what happens in another the row is removed between the select and update my update statement will fail where the insert statement should have and i feel like i need to do two similar statements to accomplish the same what i need is some statement that will assure me that the data i want exists in the especially when i only want 1 row that satisfies my for it might be something like is totally of sure a row in cars where is set with if of 5 exists it will be it will be if i changed the for example to say that each user can have zero or one cars of a given then i could further specify sure a row in cars where and is set with hope my question makes how can i improve this basic or operation that comes up so thanks for any way to insert a row if not or update it if it is

id uniquely identifies an element within the entire whereas a class name is like a many tags can be added to an and the tags can be a comparison can add multiple class names to an element separated by but you can only add a single can a class name on multiple but can use an id only once within an entire id can be used as a fragment identifier on the and the browser will scroll to that for it is not possible to do this with id makes it much easy and efficient to find a particular element in for in note that libraries like jquery make it possible to find elements by their class name but not nearly as properties of is possible for an element to contain both an id and a number of class and it or mean if the id is the same as one of the class iframes and traditional popup windows count as separate so it is possible to use the same id on elements within these different browsers do not follow the specification and allow for the same id to be used multiple and for it to behave in some ways like a class name but still work in for a css selector based on that id may match multiple elements as if it were a this is a really messy situation and you should never rely on be happy if browsers stopped trying to support

is a fun and exciting place to practice their examples start fairly light and work through extensive you want to take it that their approach is learn by here is a recursive function that i wrote to simply replace a for for string holder for index i holder return is the recursion to do the same we overload the first method to make sure it is used just like we also have another method to maintain our index to the way the for statement does it for you the recursive function must maintain their own string to call the recursive string int recursive to get a better idea of how this works without a for you can also replace this with the for loop it should do the same if return return index make recursive make a long story recursion is a good way to write less in the latter printbar notice that we have an if if our condition has been we will exit the recursion and return to the previous which returns to the previous if i sent in a i get i am hoping that with an example of a simple function that does the same thing as a for loop that maybe this will you can practice this more at java bat

is how it works on you do you restrict exporting variables with gcc command line argument and explicitly flag exported entries with the visibility the executable will have a table of all functions it imports are all functions with default the will pick an address to load the libraries to and fill this table just before the calls to those functions are indirect that this holds for shared objects as static linking is performed on is after you the actual addresses are substituted in the and they are direct there is the thing called pic independent this deals with references to in the same shared so the linker overwrite half of the code of the library when loading the in the way that the code make any absolute references to its own you might try to experiment with

is more depth of what though it will be interesting to see if others agree or what they have to how computers work you have hardware that has integer and and a vast array of random access and instructions which are mostly of the form on reading the value of this go poke this new value into this memory cells has all kinds of perf implications when it comes to cache lines and coherency and memory models and integers are 32 or 64 and nearly all programming languages surface these data types that exactly match the nearly every runtime works with a small call stack where objects are and a more expensive where other objects can be created and destroyed when are consider most modern functional programming immutability is the you will rarely memory with new means you create more which means you allocate lambdas and continuations are the you more rarely have object lifetimes that correspond to the some fp runtimes use a in a cps implementation the notion of stack and program counter are recursion is a looping so you at least need calls to not consume the stack practically everything needs to and of course you need a algebraic data types provide tagged in theory these tags would only require an extra 2 or 3 bits of but to match the they often need to have an extra word of memory or i am kind of but the things you do in an fp language tend to correspond to exactly to the things that or are on the typical computer hardware architecture and basic language have to be that one can imagine a world where the runtime eschews a and makes fast not a bottleneck for one can imagine a world where the interoperable integer types have 29 or 60 and the use the extra leftover bits of the word for the or algebraic type or think some fp do some of these the point if you take a modern functional language as a and then design around it would look very different from the typical of think i communicated that and i am imprecise about many details i know but hopefully you grok the gist of my thesis

low level can be explored with a disassembler but the short answer is that a bunch of where the predicate depends on the instance of check followed by fetching the two arguments and assigning to two variables l and r but see below about custom extractors equality foo instance of x assignment to a fresh do this is the tail else on the much more that you can do with patterns like or patterns and combinations like but generally those are just logical extensions of what i just patterns can also have which are additional constraints on the there are also cases where the compiler can optimize pattern when some overlap between cases it might coalesce things a advanced patterns and optimization are an active area of work in the so be surprised if the byte code improves substantially over these basic rules in current and future versions of addition to all you can write your own custom extractors in addition to or instead of the default ones scala uses for case if you then the cost of the pattern match is the cost of whatever the extractor a good overview is found in

martin wrote an some times ago about the differences between the mono state pattern and the singleton	
maurice herlithy shows in the art of multiprocessor programming that actually can be written without locks chapter this essentially involves splitting tasks into processing node elements a function and enqueuing each threads will calculate the state by following all nodes from the latest cached obviously this in worst result in sequential but it does have important lockless preventing scenarios where threads could get scheduled out for long peroids of time when they are holding herlithy also achieves theoretical meaning that one thread will not end up waiting forever to win the atomic enqueue is a lot of complicated queue stack is surprisingly hard the other things may be very become accustomed to atomiccas until i swapped it they are incredibly an intuition for correct with cas can help though you should use good testing and maybe more powerful tools upcoming mit or to check correctness if you can reduce it to a simple post more about your difficult to give a good answer without immutibility is nice but applicability is if understanding it it really overcome consider two threads executing they could both read then both write not the correct for a classic increment probably slow due to heap allocation has to be synchronized across

might be tricky of its nature or my way of describing so really read this before have this app to desktop no data layer in sense of files or any other repository need to store or load app will have some computation algorithms implemented provides gui which will display controls for app and computations am thinking about using mvc pattern but i have doubts how to use since i have no data layer in sense of database is generated during execution based on user i am concerned about way of using mvc in this so far i have came up with two is the geneticalgorithm is the geneticalgorithmresults is the model class that only stores basic view sends user input to the controller is processing user input and generates controller sends generated data to the model notifies the view about new view pulls new data and updates the is the appengine is the geneticalgorithm nad geneticalgorithmresults are the now we view sends user input to the controller is processing user input and sends control signals to the model updates its internal state new model notifies the controller about new controller pulls data to controller processes controller pushes processed data to the view updates the approach seems to be more straightforward and more like the problem is that some logic would have to be in the model decide when to notify the model as not all data updates will be or maybe display will be updated with the sets of data not every little those decisions will be based on user whats more some additional processing of the data may be needed before actual this would be in the the other hand second approach seems to be more complicated and looks like to much messages are being passed to achieve the but it gives full control of logic to the controller and separates responsibilities of the the controller and the model is the main purpose of approach would you or maybe i should mix them and use first approach architecture with communication flow from second or some different for desktop app with no data

mvc implementation would renders the data for the end user to see and gives them user interface objects to interact with the data not to handle that handles the user interaction and manipulation of data traveling between the views and the handles storage of data and the representation of that data for the frequent usage of the mvc pattern would be the rendering for the view portion of a web the language application level acting as the and mysql or a similar database acting as the model may or may not have some sort of orm framework in front of truth very few people use mvc in exactly this and for good reason my different applications have different needs and design requirements and beneficial to bend the patterns to what is these seems to describe more of the usage of a framework that isolates the layers of an application than the specific an employer what is really being looked for is that layer of abstraction and the experience that comes from building an a fairly sizable mental jump that happens when you move from working in an app that can be divided up not only into vertical features but into horizontal layers of features as a skinning is really just an aspect of one particular you can change the data sources at the model the methods of manipulating that data new algorithm for at the controller layer and roll them out gradually without having to change the other

not worth worrying too much about the hash functions of the standard jdk even if you could override string in hash function is practically always there are maybe a few certain classes such as biginteger and collections calculate their hash code every time by cycling through every single element they which is pretty spurious in some but how often do you key on instances of those designing hash codes for your own the thing trying to do is spread hash codes over the range of to do you generally want to the bits of successive fields in your object may be interested in an article on my web site that graphically illustrates the string hash code mixes multiplying the current hash by an odd number generally a prime then adding in the hash of the next element generally works sufficiently well as a first problems can occur with this method for the codes being combined tend to have zeroes in their lower generally no practical hash function absolutely guaranteed to work well in all you can consider testing your hash generate a series of random objects even use some real calculate their hash and off the 16 bits of the hash and then see how many collisions you check that the number of collisions you get roughly matches the number of collisions expect to get by for if you and off the bottom 16 bits of the hash code then after 1000 random expect about 8 after expect about 30 far as performance is then up to some i think that getting a hash code well distributed will generally be more beneficial nowadays than sacrificing hash quality for hash calculation

nothing inherently wrong with using session state in an web as long as you use it sparingly and pay attention to good design for it make sense to cache large objects in session state and then use sql server to manage session you will be large amounts of data from a database which defeats the objective of caching it in the first using session state to store some primitives between pages seems ok to

of a side there is an interesting talk given by juval lowey regarding if you have many tiny then you increase effort to if you have only a few large you decrease but you have more complex components to so your effort to integrate is dependent on the architecture and where it balances the number of components to their a good balance is because if you drift too one side or the the effort required increases if you have 20 components and add a not just more because you have to consider the interactions of the potentially other 20 so adding one component adds the potential for 20 ways to interact with the existing of course a good design will limit this interaction to as few components as but that was basically why juval felt it was

of the great things about web development is that most when you see a site and think did they do very easy to look at the code and find and also to test it out tools like for the developer tools in ie 8 and chrome will all display nicely formatted source and and will let you modify it in the case of the main body of the site is contained in a div with class of the style rules for 0 key thing looking at here is that this class has a width 950 and the margins are set to the left and right margins to has the affect of centering the div within the edges of and allowing them to expand to whatever width is needed once the container has taken up the required the container you then have a div with id style and then two and whose styles this is also set in the attribute left and right floats are positioning the bars in the right handy css rule can be set to or and will basically reset the floats on the it sounds like after what is often called the grail of points out that a bug in this with see for a for good three with at least one of them of completely flexible layouts layouts climb out of the

of the social networking sites like twitter use an rdbms at all but a message queue a lot of them start out with a already present application like some of them get big enough they have to heavily customize or build their twitter is in the process of doing this for the second message queue application works by holding messages from one service for one or more other for instance say service frank is publishing messages to a queue joe and jill are subscribed to franks foo the application will keep track of whether or not joe or jill have recieved the messages and once every subscriber to the queue has recieved the message it discards frank fires messages and forgets about joe and jill ask for messages from foo and get whatever messages they gotten joe and jill do whatever they need to do with the perhaps keeping it around perhaps message queue application guarantees that everyone who is supposed to get the message can and will get the message when they request the publisher can send the messages confident that subscriber can get them this has the benefit of being completely asynchronous and not requiring costly i should mention also that usually the storage for these kind of things at high scale are heavily so joe and jill may be storing a copy of the exact same this is considered ok because it helps the application scale to billions of	
of this depends on how the parsing will be integrated into an if the application is the then perl will be just due to that it will handle everything surrounding it but if integrated directly into a larger then fully possible that you may want to look into something like lex flex these this tool generates the parser for and you can integrate the code directly into your for speed i agree with most other responders here that the maturity of the library used will be the dominant and is very i know how mature some of the other libraries are the regex one available for from but being as most of your processing time will be in the language concerns are likely use what most comfortable and do as much work as possible inside the as faster than what you can produce in any

of you are doing a software you are making architecture part of the you have bad feelings to product x for unfounded reasons said yourself you are not very familiar with the say product x would be able to solve your problem on time and on budget at half the wouldnt you be totally nuts to go with product y just because you have bad dreams of world i think if your company is to be successful you have to have a more mature this case however i dont think silverlight would be suitable for what you i know silverlight does not have the audio capabilities to interface with the mic in this but then again flex does not have desktop privileges not without air but air apps do need to be installed since they are like a leech on the users system they arent really webapps you shouldnt compare silverlight to air as they are completely different air runs apps on the you should compare air apps against framework wpf apps and i know between those two where i would put my money and so what if your app only runs on of the when you code on the framework in this is actually the main argument for flash people over so if its flash silverlight is wonderful if its developing a windows hey you cant leave out the other just goes to show its not black and installing a plugin is not a big flash does not support native hd streaming video without a yet to install this hd people have no problem with yet when installing a silverlight plugin it all of a sudden becomes a problem to some would also need to be some kind of server infrastructure behind your i doubt you will be able to code the servers in looking at something more performant and simply put when competing with a product like voipbuster and the gazillion other voip services even for you have to wonder if even endeavouring on a profitable you say you have only one month experience in either recommend first in getting more development experience in general before moving on to a huge project to take on the a lot to wants to conquer the that may be true but that is the holy grail for all companies and its you say you dont want microsoft to own the yet you see your own application dominating facts any company is out to make a profit whether it is adobe or you can always write a java program and be really cool

pointed out by you probably broken the one definition rule probably included the header file with the definition of class c in two translation units where other often in a preceding header changes the way the definition of class c is interpreted so that it has a different size in the two translation is that accidently changed the default member alignment through a command line argument to the compiler or via a in the so that two different translation units think the structure has a different size because of differing amounts of padding x86 compilers default to alignment on but allow you to request alignment on boundaries as look in the other header files for a changing the default alignment that is missing a following to restore it back to the previous value specify what so i give	
positioning in web layouts is to say the the part everyone knows about is the but what a lot of people realize the difference between two elements only comes in to play if at the same depth in the dom if the one that is higher in the tree closest to being directly under the will always be regardless of the in if you put your a tag higher in the it should take precedence over the maybe not in in certain elements know for sure selects do but video probably does always appear everything the common workaround for this is to use another one of those elements an as the background for your alternatively there are libraries as the bgiframe plugin for that will handle this sort of thing for none of that you also might just want to try hooking up an event handler to the a maybe even the video and then in that handler do to prevent the click from you could also do to prevent the default action of the movie but have to do that on the movie if you do it on the need to make the handler do since it will prevent the default action of the going to the one of those ideas works for

primary question is which approach is developing an application using have this one module where i capture some data and store it in the data comes in no duplicates are to be for discussion sake we can assume a table with just one and name that column is named so if we get a keyword already in database we do not store it and we have set this column as primary key and made it query i have before i insert this new data into the shall i do a db call and check if the keyword exists or if it exists put it into something i just insert and let the database handle the effectively letting it throw an which i try catch keyword know catching an exception and not doing anything is so not looking for what is good and what is bad what i want to understand is which approach would be the in relation to javascript and sqlite but general comments are syntax used is just for illustration you may assume that i create sql execute them and fetch the or assume it is a javascript library call which does all the dirty question is a bit like this i check for db constraints in code or should i catch exceptions thrown by i want to understand the performance related differences as the application working on needs to be as fast as possible application and javascript checking for existence of data before inserting or letting sqlite throw an

problem in your original code was that you were adding an to the but when you read a value out of the list you assigned the pointer directly to another so you had was was essentially a value stored in an delphi generally allows you to assign the untyped type to any including fix your original you would need to write the second look something like i 0 to do p if not f if not were right to call in your first when the reference count on the result is because the value stored in the loop is a not the actual you need to increment the reference count because is going to be for other since the reference manually counting is stored in the it would be better to call inside instead of waiting until it you clear the or as you remove items from the you would need to call on all the interface gives the better use to store a list of simply suited to the task by final piece of the prefix on names is used to denote interfaces have method implementations of their shown the implementation of so clearly an interface it should be named or maybe

programming can be amazingly however you be hiring programmers in you force developers to pair it only works when two developers click and decide they can learn from each other and build something awesome my advice is to hire as many of the smartest developers you can find and put them in a setting that naturally lends itself to encouraging pair developers need to be able to code but also talk to others on the team about the right mix that works for you and your company will be more art than and certainly not something you can do by blindly following the demands of some published the more bugs you squash before they ever get checked the more you save in the long having another developer looking on as you architect something will always be more effective than having a tester it call it money well

question is mainly geared towards zend in although it certainly applies to other languages and so i welcome only recently been using the zend and while not i have had a pretty good time with one thing that drives me is that most of the examples i see of people using zend do the in special form rather than in the i think this is bad practice because data can enter into the system in other ways beyond form which means that either validators have to be bent and twisted to validate other or validation must be done in a second and logic found some other posts and blogs out there with people who feel the same way i but the developers of zend made this choice for a and other people seem to use it without so i wanted to get some feedback from the community i this mainly applies to although i think important to look at the issue as a rather than working within the confines of the zend since zend was designed so that you could use as or as as you validation be done in form or the

requires random access so your only options to use that are vector or it will swap the and at a guess vector will probably perform slightly faster than deque because it typically has a simpler underlying data the difference is likely very marginal you use a there is a specialisation which should swap the pointers rather than the however because not random access use mergesort instead of which will probably mean that the algorithm itself is a little i think the answer is normally if you have large classes for each element so copying overhead dominates the sorting list might beat or alternatively you could store pointers to them in a vector and supply a custom predicate to sort them

seem to have two forms of equivalence to deal plain equivalence tracked as equivalence classes which are kept up to date and structural equivalence for which you occasionally go build a single equivalence class and then throw it sounds to me like the problem would be conceptually simpler if you maintain equivalence classes for both plain and structural if that introduces too much churn for the structural you could maintain equivalence classes for some aspects of structural then you could find a balance where you can afford the maintenance of those equivalence classes but still greatly reduce the number of nodes to examine when building a list of structurally equivalent

similar things would apply for other there are of things to is great for functional programming works well concurrently partly due to the emphasis on locks when you access mutable shared both for reads and try to go unless you really have locks are but rarely the should almost be part of a condition waiting for a condition to become true and waiting again if to avoid holding locks for longer than you need you ever need to acquire two locks at document the ordering thoroughly and make sure you always use the same the of your most types need to be they just need to not be thread hostile can use them from multiple but responsible for taking out locks if you want to share access the ui in documented from a in windows use off the top of my head i probably think of more if this is useful to but stop there in case

solution is wrong because the methods are your even but if you add delimiters and set multiline it will work modifier allows to match the beginning of a logical line rather than just the beginning of the whole the anchor is necessary because without it the regex would match the newline at the end of every not just the blank you need the anchor because actively matching the newline but it gets the job but more complicated than it needs to the regex has to match either the beginning of the string multiline mode not or at least one newline followed by at least one newline in the special case of a string that starts with one or blank be replaced with blank pretty sure not the desired what it does most of the time is replace two or more consecutive along with any horizontal whitespace or that lies between with one the the author seems to expect to match just the space character when in fact it matches any whitespace a very common the actual list varies from one regex flavor to the but at minimum you can expect to match whatever in php you have a better matches any horizontal whitespace and matches vertical live demos and the site keeps changing back to so select the tab at the top to see it

solved this one using much to my dismay when i discovered that python can do this in one simple goal is to create an adding machine using arrays of int ended up using an array of values to simulate an adding but i represented the number which you can do because the problem only asks for the sum of the this means order is essentially doing doubling the value 1000 so can double the value 1 stored in 1st element of the and continue looping until your value over this is where you will to keep track of a carry first power of 2 that is over 10 so the elements in the array the 5th iteration are 6 and when you loop through the starting at the 1st value becomes 12 you keep the and set a carry bit on the index of the which value is doubled you get 2 plus the 1 for the carry bit equals now you have 2 and 3 in array which represents this process 1000 times have an array with roughly elements that you can easily add

sounds like you are confusing validator controls with an internal mechanism of for sanitizing validation is entirely dependant on your are you using a then the invalid inputs are simply blank is it a then you need to enter something that match the regular then you need to check the validation sounds to me more like worried about the input being sanitized for running database queries the first thing to check is that in your page being set to if it that would explain why html is being allowed should also check out the protect against script exploits in a web application by applying html encoding to user input in web if like to try a database injection just google for a basic sql injection

the best of my there are no preprocessor directives for detecting strict you are using then the compiler will warn you about code that may break the strict aliasing this option is only active when it warns about code might break the strict aliasing that the compiler is using the warning does catch all but does attempt catch the more common it included in it is to the code you are working on is critical then you can disable in or if you want to disable strict i suggest looking at the asm output to make sure the compiler doing dangerous optimizations that you an akauppi said in the enables strict optimizations for particular restrict keyword does not directly but rather it gives the compiler more information and that extra information indirectly helps the compiler determine if it can apply specific optimization good explanation of the restrict keyword from dsp compiler help the compiler determine memory you can qualify or array with the restrict the restrict keyword type qualifier that may be applied to and its a guarantee by the programmer that within the scope of the the object pointed to can be accessed only by that of this guarantee renders the program this practice compiler optimize certain sections of code because aliasing be more easily

the easiest solution is to only really working on one project at a if you work on multiple you could have another alias which changed the directories within those aliases use something game17 this is a useful thing to i decided to put together a series of scripts that can be all based aroung a configuration file that you place in your home along with aliases to source the file is of the lists all the relevant projects and sodoku in this and their directories may be different for each but have src and data in this first action is to initialize so the end of your and create the file sets up the four aliases to source the files which include usage list all directories in current list all show current set current project to show current and since they can get out of sync if you mix cd and set actual real directory to expected directory other get them back into set directory to actual script which just lists the allowed directories in the current project are broken into multiple lines for readability but they should all be on one directories grep sed sort sed shows all the possible projects grep sed sort sed the meaty sets shows the current grep if 0 echo project name export project is the same for directories within the grep if 0 echo directory name for project export cd sed head sed sed head sed project directory directory uses three environment variables which are reserved for its own and other than those and the files and there are no other resources the yet most adaptable solution i could come up best of	
the entity framework keeps data in do many then as with many collections there are probably internal as you add items to a the internal array doubles in if you have a collection like an arraylist containing 256 and add the 257th item to then what happens internally is a new block of memory is allocated for a 512 item they 256 item array is copied to the new 512 item and then the 256 item array is made available for garbage thus at the point of transition you will have 768 items allocated in memory just because you added the 257th i have run into headaches with this when using because you need almost 3 times as much contigous unfragmented memory than what you really this is the property you see on and it is almost always a power of it double in size as bet is there are internal arrays that double in size as needed to support your collections of in memory so objects of the same type would probably be held in an internal array of size if like similar techniques elsewhere in the then whenever the 262145th item was both an array of 262144 and 524288 existed in memory while the items were copied to the new a total of 786432 items in the old array would stick around until the garbage collector decided it needed might be some options in the entity framework regarding concurrency support that you could disable which might improve memory i am only speculating here but to support concurrency they store both the current version of the and original version for comparison to support would also look at filtering what data you are interacting try to find clever criteria to limit what is queried and loaded in for if you had an application that allowed a user to edit customer but only certain accounts were assigned to then use that as your filtering criteria so that you only load in memory those accounts that the user could potentially interact

the the async attribute is for the case where your page is going to call some task that also blocks the and then your page needs the output from that task in order to return info to the for if your page needed to call a web wait for its and then use the data from the response to render your reason use the async attribute is to avoid blocking the this is important because applications use a thread pool to serve and there are only a relatively small number of threads and if each call ties up the thread while waiting on the web service then soon going to hit enough concurrent users that users are going to have to wait until these web service calls the async attribute lets the thread return to the thread pool and serve other concurrent visitors to your web rather than forcing it to sit still doing nothing while waiting for the web service call to upshot for you is the async attribute is designed for the case where you render the page until the asynchronous task and why it render the page need to launch your own and make it a daemon i remember the exact syntax for but you can easily find it in the doc by searching the bcl doc for this means the thread will keep your application from shutting down while it is which is important because and iis reserve the right to your when they deem it and if that happens while your thread is your task will be making the thread daemon will prevent this for some possible rare edge cases find out more when you find the documentation on daemon thread is where you will kick off these and after told the daemon thread to do the you can immediately render your page so the rendering of the page will happen better than a daemon thread in your would be to implement a windows service for doing the have your application communicate the task to be performed to the no need for a daemon thread and no need to worry about your process being how do you tell the service to do the perhaps through or perhaps by inserting a record into a database table that the service or a number of other another which i have used before for this very same write the info about your task into an msmq have another process even on another pull from that queue and do the the job of inserting into a queue is optimized to return as quickly as so your thread block while the data you put in the queue is sent across the wire or anything like it is one of the fastest ways to make note of the fact that a task needs to be done without waiting for that task to

these actually three different concepts or am i getting been reading articles about threading and garbage collection together and have confused i think this may just be the term for sections of code that you want multiple threads accessing at the same time inside lock and no real clue here msdn says something along the lines of tells a host that exceptions thrown within the section might have wider and that of the clr sql may choose to handle exceptions thrown within critical regions differently and most in what real world scenarios might i need to mark code as a critical execution i came across this when reading about the criticalfinalizerobject in a garbage collection all i can understand from msdn on this one is that code within one of these regions is somehow guaranteed to run and must therefore not throw what is an did google this but it just asked me if i meant of bounds is it any unhandled or only certain types of and most in what real world scenarios might i need a execution i understand the concepts at all not sure what tags this question needs other than between and execution	
these methods are very different in terms of what they get compiled though very much similar in terms of try to summarise the differences in is a simple private instance easily going to be the most efficient when is a property a get but no set is a normal parameterless i suspect just offering these examples purely as a point of and realise that such a function is totally useless are private in almost all the layout everything on one is also rather 2 and 3 are going to be equally inefficient compared to 1 in that they both involve the overhead of function i know by memory the cil code that they all compile to someone else can produce but they certainly involve a few more whereas referencing ought to only require a single instruction in sure i can make a very useful comment on best practice without knowing more about the but method 2 a private is generally seen as quite the third method should never be used in my opinion begging to be turned into a i think what you really want is just a plain old private so definitely go for the first public values should always be accessed as properties rather than variables in classes a backing variable to a but that is slightly unrelated to your could find plenty of resources discussing the matter in a quick search note that if your is going to be not modified at any you really want to use a const string mystring1 that helps clarify things a

think overthinking essentially what you want to know far as i can tell correct me if is which questions have been answered by a given and which questions for answer in unanswered questions are everything point of doing it this way rather than solution is that you should use what you know sooner rather than if you filter the for every question by your initial query will be selecting every single answer and every single question in these by starting from the known data the we are selecting only answers and questions related to that if you then want to combine the two sets into a single there are a bunch of ways you could do this for instance by creating a list of q in for q in you can iterate over retaining the order of the q in print is that this user answered the not pretty but you get the point already determined what you wanted to just a matter of contorting it to whatever data structure you happen to

used the following to require the checkout section of a website to require rewriteengine options order allow from rewritecond rewriterule rewriterule for hitting redirects to rule will skip file extensions that are typically included within a page so that you get mixed content you should add to this list as you want multiple pages change the rewriterule to something the directory should match the actual path on your this page may also help with some more information for your specific using this on a website that runs plesk but that this is in my file which is like putting it in your not sure if need to adjust anything to use it in a file but i doubt if adding to a conf file forget to restart apache to reload the you are like me and want to use ssl only on particular pages then you also want a rewrite rule that sends you back to regular http for the you can use the following for the reverse you are using plesk like i am keep in mind that all traffic uses the file but all ssl traffic uses the that means your first rewrite rule to require ssl would go in the file but the second rule to force back to will have to go in the if you are using or i think you can put them both in the same also posted this tutorial on my rewrite rules to force

users have provide some very useful links above so i am not going to bother with i have done a similar research in jaas for web application and has ran into a until i finally realize jaas is a framework tackling security at a different then web applications in the java it is build to tackle security issues in java se not java is a security framework built for securing things at a much lower level then some example of these things are code and resources available at the jvm hence all these ability to set policy files in the jvm since java ee is built on top of java a few modules from jaas were reused in java ee security such as the loginmodules and that in addition to java ee there is also spring security known as which similar to native java ee security tackles a much higher in the securing it is a separate security implementation and is not built on top of standard java ee although it behaves similarly in many unless you are looking to secure resources in the java se level system i see any real use of jaas other than the using the common class and just focus on using spring security or plain old java ee security which both solve a lot of common web application security

what i understand you need a file system and not a memory allocation at in embedded systems dynamic memory allocation in a disk is a contradictory a either a hard disk or a flash used for persistent storage is much different than it is not only the way you access but the fact that disk storage when writing to a disk you need to have an algorithm for avoiding bad have you thought of this or can you consider your disk fault file system will deal both with space allocation and bad sectors is usually used in embedded although fragmentation performance is rather this prevented it from being used in many embedded most flash based devices actually use i suggest to start with what you have your operation system you use and the driver for your investigate if a suitable solution is already supported from also keep in mind that embedded devices are more difficult to debug if you set to implement your own algorithms expect longer development

while back we were transferring our reasonably popular forum to a new dedicated server the same and we noticed something at first we used the new server to host just the database as this was the biggest then later we transferred the forum files and changed the dns for the we look back at the bandwidth used we see this for the bytes sent by the forum bytes received by the server stayed very low is it normal for a forum database to use 4 times more network traffic then the server actually sends back to the it sounds very inefficient to like requesting much more than what is needed from the but this is the latest version of vbulletin talking about bandwidth much higher compared to server

will get you the 32 bit number as a four byte bytes as get the first two bytes as a signed 16 bit first as int16 get the first two bytes as an unsigned 16 bit first as uint16 is of course a bit slower than using bit shifts or but it handles the sign bit most significant which you may have problems with using bit shift or can also get the first two bytes as a 16 bit unsigned number and assign it to an first as integer a signed 16 bit number and assign to an integer means that the sign bit would also be copied to the top 16 bits of the which is probably not you want the last two bytes instead of the first two just change the index in the call from 0 to

will work in a very broad range of static int int lastbit int secondlastbit lastbit int tuple lastbit if return n if return n return initial approach was to use the last bit as a check bit to know where be in the first or the second place this bit to 1 after the first call to signal the second call the first had already this approach was defeated by negative numbers whose last bit already arrives at 1 during the first same theory applies to the second last bit for most negative what usually happens is that most of the the last and second last bits are the either they are both 1 for negative numbers or they are both 0 for positive my final approach is to check whether they are either both 1 or both meaning that for most cases this is the first if the last bit is different from the second last then i assume we are at the second and simply the last obviously this work for very big numbers that use those two last once it works for a very wide range of

work in a bigco as we have a growing curve here taking over both from vb6 and from there is and will be a lot of java written which is i really think that the will be technology is i understand why people go that but in a typical large shop it seems to be far too suggest instead of trying to combat java on the just look for the opportunities for where it is clearly better for a particular if you are writing a small app to do some crud used by 10 or less it makes a lot of sense in my mind to do it with winforms instead of as a webapp because so much quicker to write them and with so few users you have a distribution you also get the full integrated security thing if you use ad been the approach we have here it has allowed to penetrate all in other it is clearly better to go java team so any large company is going to have a lot of microsoft and a lot of javaesque hardware sitting around to run stuff on so it seem to me that in bigco it should matter much at all which of the two big platforms you sometimes is sometimes i think a big shop should foster think in a few we will be seeing python more like or ruby as a viable alternative

work using fxcop and some other tertiary software on our right now we have the project files for each app stored in the repo and the software is installed per developer machine currently only hiring a couple other developers in a few weeks and trying to set things up to be easier and more read that a good idea to install these types of software into the the and shortcuts to your desktop to run the this makes it so that easy to update to newer versions of the software them to your working over top of the old and then commit the and a cinch to update all of the the next checkout will include the new version of the this work as has anyone tried considering the repository folder structure if got multiple pieces of software being do you install a copy say in each extras or do you install one and only one in the common folder to be used for all latter makes me think that a logical and physical disconnect between the project and the but the former means that there could be a whack of different tools because project a is using nunit and project b is using nunit along with all of the other not sure if this last part makes let me know and should i install development tools

would definitely use mmap for the this would make it easy to directly access the data and flush to disk when the only thing you would have to control is where the file is mapped in the address so you can move it possibility for memory management is to create a different file for each and use level defragmentation rather than implementing it you never mentioned what you are but if it already has online defragmentation i would use if you are using linux and can use you can use i would expect defragmentation to be highly optimized and it would take a lot less effort than to implement on your own in one big

would like to build on a this is what is known more generally as the idea is the first code is the it tells you how to interpret the the second code is the which tells you how many bytes there are in the this is a great way to do extensible binary encoding and is used a lot in mpeg would add in a few more on a good functional binary a in each message that states the protocol version for the every field in byte consider the size of each using a encoding scheme for i find a good but the idea is that the top bit is 1 if there are more bytes and 0 if this is the last byte and the lower seven bits in each byte contains the everything on to the wire as bytes and never first one is really it is more important that you plan for change and carefully decide how the protocol will clients should never attempt to interpret a message if they support the version fifth one is pretty important when it comes to having a stable written quite a few binary protocol implementations for embedded devices and using packed structures is the mistake that i regret the i have had too many defects related to forgetting to byte swap a numeric field or not packing a just write a nice library of byte packing and unpacking test it and use it you design and implement the protocol with these principles in it will make your life a lot easier when you have to support and the last thing that i would highly recommend is writing a dissector for something like for your it will also make and supporting things easier as just make sure to completely understand the possible legal implications of writing such a dissector as well as deploying one before you consider

would suggest using nmap nmap at appears to be appears to be 11 ip addresses hosts scanned in if you want to write it yourself is fair this is how i would do ip in do ping 1 echo is an explanation of each bit of the above list of ip can use the syntax to generate a list of for echo 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 also useful for things like which makes and each containing and to generate a list of do something echo loop over something in you use for thingy in 1 2 do echo to the ping command varies a bit with different different using os x default on the os x version of it will ping until which going to work for so will only try sending one which should be enough to determine if a machine is problem is the timeout which seems to be 11 seconds on this version of changed using the one second should be enough to see if a machine on the local network is alive or the ping command use ping 1 1 56 data ping statistics packets 0 packets packet ping we need to know if the machine replied or can use the operator to run a command if the first for echo echo nonexistantcommand echo should not command not so we can 1 1 echo is other way would be to use the exit code from the ping command will exit with 0 if it and a code if it in bash you get the last commands exit code with the variable to check if the command 1 1 0 echo is echo is ping we need to see the ping so we can redirect to with the for ping 1 1 echo is is to redirect discard the host is you use for command not errorcausingcommand to combine all ip in do for loop and the ping 1 1 ping and discard if 0 then check the exit echo is display the you could send this to a log file by using the echo is using the in a ip in do ping 1 1 echo is each ping command takes about 1 second we set the timeout flag to 1 it can only run one ping command at a the obvious way around this is to use so you can run concurrent but beyond what you should use bash threads a first explains how to use the python threading module to write a although at that i would once again suggest using

years are and the system used to describe them is a man made there is no i mean is there could have been a leap year every 28 years and we would have an extra week in those leap years but the powers that be decided to make it a day every 4 years to catch also has to do with the earth taking a pesky days to go round the sun of course it really is it slightly less so to correct for this discrepancy they decided drop the leap years that are divisible by

you always or almost always want to build both a qa and uat release at the same if it makes sense to build them in the same if separate may be other things you want to take into consideration tasks in targets that may be specific to one build or but if you do choose to build them pretty easy to set up in your build just add a second configurationtobuild	
you are creating your user controls then the most appropriate place is in the init right where the controls are created should the load phase will work just and is probably where most people set you set the handlers anywhere later than otherwise they would never be since the event handling phase is next in line after	
you are developing with then you have a template available for creating windows you will create a timer do your initialization on the onstart do clean and finalize stuff on the onstop and initialize the timer or with a can look at this for a or for an example with the besides the options in another you can also create an installer check the template	
you are doing is effectively a simple mode backup with bonus disadvantage of not shrinking the there is no point to back up both at the same if doing a full you can just truncate the going to be able to restore to any point of you will have to do a full backup once a day and back up the log few times during the see	
you are doing test driven development your code should be hitting at least without some areas you just or is pointless to have test thats where nocoverage attributes for ncover come in handy can mark classes to be excluded by code coverage be adhered to it should simply be a useful way to give you hints at areas you have missed with it should be your not

you are generally most functions do indeed focus on lists for a few of these there are equivalent functions for sequences and come to and where the is outdated for lists only for all some functions simply work on sequences for is a bit of a a big as in over 700 and some of these functions are deprecated by and others are if it would be more useful to have mapping functions be that applied as intended on all cl was simply not built that if it were to be built again sure this would be and it would look you are not left completely in the the macro works on as does separate looping which i happen to like this will get you for most practical purposes you will be using and this be more than a pragmatic if you do happen to lack a mapping function for vectors sequences in to stop you from writing	
you are managing the development and someone else is doing the implementation and maintenance then suggest to negotiate the programming language with you have to do the maintenance then focus on languages that you you do of the just use what language you are familiar when you have enough time to learn a new language on the especially if the application is important and needs to be pretty bug there is never a as we all amount of 3rd party libraries is not a good criterion because this reflect their quality most stuff is and many libraries means also a big chance to select the wrong forget to check if the chosen language is capable of doing the platform memory	
you are missing is a loop that checks each and putting the if statement inside it and make it compare the length of the name to the longest name that you have found so if the name is put it in the variable for the longest and update the length can either initialise the variables with the name of the first member and loop from the second member and or you can initialise the variables with an empty string and loop all the personally i prefer the latter	
you are proposing is the i like to link to but its a good place to start at take a look at the pros and cons and see if it would be beneficial to think really a need for you to do it this you can simply make the locatebox method public and have it call private helpers based on which search you want to generally a bad idea to overly complicate your class structure just for the sake of using some oo design wait until you find a for and then refactor this will help point out what is really necessary and what is a waste of your another approach that i was thinking of would be to create a data class that has properties based on the various things you could search a boxsearchdata class that has properties such as and then pass that to and construct the query as necessary based on the properties that are this would help you construct searches on multiple criteria later down the	
you are really app is very or there are major performance issues do not fix the if it fix create a new table as you suggest with the same key and start adding you could make proper tables with grouped columns as new columns either if the schema is this bet the code is very	
you are scaling down by a factor of each 4x4 block of pixels in your original image will correspond to a single pixel in your output you can then loop through each 4x4 block in the original image and then reduce this to a single a simple way not the best to do this reduction could be to take the average or median of the rgb should note that you cannot do image scaling without losing image quality unless for all the blocks in the original each pixel is the exact same colour is	
you are sharing even an int across threads in a you need proper memory barriers in this can mean using interlocked instructions interlockedincrement in win32 for or using a language that makes certain with cpu level and caches and other unless you have those assume anything shared across threads is one thing you can assume with most architectures is that if you are dealing with properly aligned single you end up with a single word containing a combination of two values that were mashed if two writes happen over top of each one will and the other will be if you are you can take advantage of and see that either or are in the single reader	
you are truly trying to test the operation of a piece of code in this actually better off doing the do it in two separate executables since there is a possibility that position within the executable may affect the make sure you use cpu time rather than elapsed time not sure what gives this is to avoid errant results from a cpu loaded up with other turn off compiler optimization to ensure put in any fancy stuff likely to skew the you need to worry about if you use the actual such as the fopen you want any output at i remember whether volatile was a to the compiler or iterations of seem a little on the low where could affect the maybe a higher value would be this may not be an issue if timing a larger piece of code and just included as a	
you are trying to call from within you can just pass the actual someobject new	
you are using asmx and not wcf where you could control the life time little bit each time a request comes in the class that services the request is this is the standard behaviour for you need to do is store the com object either inside the or it may still get destroyed when the worker pool is some code like this is what you fooclass fooclass instance if instance new creates the return fooclass is the runtime callable wrapper for your com the application object contents is retained between one thing you do need to watch out for is the threading model that the com component is using as some can cause performance problems because they marshal calls onto a single	
you are using some sort of like have an extension or whatever you mapped to the dispatcher the dispatcher the request to the which is in the users only see the url that was directed to the and get back they tell what the template language since you can choose whatever you like for the servlet you could make something or even misdirect them with something like or you might have some jsps right in the web app rather than in you can give these a different and tell the container to process them as jsps by creating a with a element that specifies the fake extension in also need to examine your documentation to determine how to hide any server version information that might be another thing to explore is how to change the session cookie name to something other than a bit of a but part of the servlet and some containers support changing

you cannot achieve this without using a client side this is where the javascript if you are trying to control what an end user can consume from your then you need to rethink how you display that an image has a public url that can be fetched via http without the need for a can control who has access to what watermarking in images can prove that the image was from a specific the end of the resource management is really first rule of the if you dont want it dont make it second rule of the if you dont want it dont put it on the	
you change what do you hope to learn from seeing an implementation of does be written in using more basic not a or part of a library header like or inside the if the compiler is itself written in c or then you can think of the implementation being something like if if return switch case case return case case case return case return for all the case int for over each class return case int for over each class return return that is is very much lots of things i but this is the general the compiler probably actually do it probably calculates the size of a type a and stores instead of recalculating every time you write it is also allowed to have pointers being different sizes depending on what they point	
you change your the table is not changing the size of your pixels are relative to your	
you checked out the ui the interaction and maybe the widget might be of interest for	
you considered implementing a protocol like webdav or even there are already file service and file transfer protocols even if you use a implementation of one of you could at least implement the protocol and save yourself from reinventing that particular you could translate one of these protocols into a web services interface but at least have a full protocol to choose from in your design	
you considered keeping your same and just shuffling the generating a schedule where everyone plays each other the proper number of times is but if you already have such a schedule then much easier to just shuffle the could keep your current but replace each team in it with an id or or then randomly generate into another table where you assign each team to each id 1 then when time to shuffle again next just regenerate that mapping sure if this answers the question the way you but is probably what i would go with is actually how i do it on my fantasy football

you do not want to hardcode calls to each getter and reflection is the only way to call these methods it is not you refactor the class in question to use a properties object to hold the actual and let each getter and setter just call on then you have a structure well suited for what you want to there is even methods to save and load them in the

you have a bunch of electrons being passed around among various atoms inside of your because of the structure of the silicon atoms in your the electrons follow certain which determine the branch of execution the computer will seems i should explain a little less bear with i majored in computer not electrical so i have a very deep understanding of these cpu is made of a a usually which is called a one of the great things about semiconductors is that their elecrical properties can be easily varied through or applying impurities that create areas of negative or positive on the the lines where these areas come together are known as and electricity flows much more easily one way across these junctions than the this property is exploited to create which allow electricity to flow only in one and which can be thought of as tiny switches that allow one electrical current to control another electrical these transistors and diodes are combined in a myriad of ways to create the logic gates of your of the logic gates inside of your cpu are dedicated to being the which is in charge of retrieving and decoding telling the rest of the cpu what to and finally getting the next on the the control unit is actually running which tells it how to deal with and so you really need to be incredibly specific about a particular line of processors to get into how the x86 isa is implemented on a particular

you it depends on a not just the site you want to but comparing it to give you a rough i host a site that gets from 20k to 30k pageviews a day on app and it costs me 17c a for extra storage over the default quota all other quotas are well within the free far as specific comparisons if we look at for their base plan is for 12gb of storage and 120gb transfer per at app engine that would cost you at most per month assuming it was all outgoing if you do less than that in a it costs you you have all the versatility on app engine that you have with a but you also have better scalability and comparison is fairly easy to other hosting i think app engine will generally come out so mostly the decision comes down to if your app is suitable for app

you mentioned template and you may be interested in this cloning vs setting of option is to use a dom such as class1 if each item is going to need the same structure created i would go with the cloning if any logic involved in creating the structure into which the content will rather maintain something like the above than fiddling about with if that approach turned out to be too fall back to	
you mentioned you already tried position but tried the following and it might work for here is the 0 the menu is positioned independent of the other ie puts the menu relative to the and hides it behind the the work around is to position it just as many to the left as the content div has but this should only done for so therefor the 0 is added before the negative which works because ie ignores while the other browers do acknowledge it and will use alohci notes a better way would be to use the in that case the css for html

you there are many do most seem to read threads as os threads used by since you mentioned erlang in your like to post a more this kind of simulation with processes micro green as they are sometimes necessarily need any in we have a couple of likely thousands or hundreds of physics objects that need to be we want to simulate these objects as realistically as but there is probably also some kind of real time aspect involved have to be you mention this in your simple solution would be to spawn of an erlang process for each sent ticks to all of them and collect the results of the simulation before proceeding with the next this is in practice synchronizing it is of course more of a deterministic solution and does not guarantee any real time it is also how the processes would talk to each other to get the data they need for the you probably need to group them in clever ways groups have hibernated processes erlang has neat support for sleeping etc to speed things get real time properties you probably need to restrain the calculations performed by the processes accuracy for this could perhaps be done by sending out ticks waiting for and letting the object processes reply back to each tick with their current position and other data you need though it might only be approximated at the as this could lead to errors accumulating in the guess in one the question is really about if it is possible to use the strength of concurrency to gain some kind of advantage if you need it is a quite strong sign that you do not need concurrency between each physics because you essentially throw away a lot of computation time by waiting for other you might use concurrency during calculation but that is another i none of these ideas take the actual physics calculations into this is not erlang strong side and could perhaps be performed in a c library or whatever strikes your depending on the type of characteristics you i do not know of any case where this has been done not by so i cannot guarantee that this is sound

you typically retrieve all the data for one entity id you should consider making the index just entity id and not unless you need the database to do unique effect is to make the index smaller so you get more of it in your goal should be to get the index to be in even if you need to do by date you will find that mysql can order 3650 values in a fraction of a second on the fly the this issue is the time to read the rows from your main performance issue is that the inserts result in data for one entity spread out across the disk requiring a disk access of each which will make your query run at a few hundred rows per your partitioning wont help this becaause each entity is in a single partition and the rows are spread across its on the disks will help a get efficient retrieval you need to get the data for a entity to be contiguous on which means reordering the data from the insert you can do this with mysql alter order by but it takes i have had a 182m row table doing a alter order by running for the last 2 weeks and it finished why i wrote a custom storage the not sure that you gain anything at all by partitioning unless you are partitioning across multiple servers or at least multiple the hard work that mysql has to do made any easier by all about disk access each partition on a different disk might i would not have more than twice as many partitions as you have physical 2 rather than 1 would give some queuing but i doubt that would have much i doubt you get much better than a single table using raid0 across as many disks as you performance of this application is determined by the number of disk and therefore helped if you can do more seeks per gain some processing parallelism you have multiple with partitioning but your system is going to be not processor if you get your processor utilization as high as you are probably doing something you need do something that your have been optimizing and operating this kind of application for the nine years using mysql and i have all the scars you might expect from the once your data is vastly larger than the size of your memory is my definition of the entire performance issue is which means primary the number of good

your problem going to guess that this software assumes a relatively beefy have you considered taking the task of determining off of sqlce and doing it on your grab a sorted list of all the from the relevant table and checking every object key against that list before queueing it for makes a few assumptions that would be bad news with a typical but that you can probably get away with in it assumes that rows be inserted or significantly modified by a different user while performing this the list of keys is too long to reasonably hold in memory for such a afraid say that sqlce just might not be the right tool for the

your question has so the solution will here are two ways to do the quick and dirty way will only partially solve your issue because it be able to account for the more odd permutations like missing spaces or misspelled the quick and dirty a new table call a text field in it you want to replace it for this example all the char or char combinatios that you want removed in this and run the query that it will only remove at a but you can also versions of the in it too like this example i created a table called with a field called top 1 char from tchar where order by as better much more this explanation is going to be general because it would be next to impossible to put the whole thing in if you want to contact me directly use my user name at a table of qualifiers that people enter like of here you every wierd permutation a table with qualifierid here you would say goes to which a query that joins the your table with mistaken in use instr so say in the a second query the count field and use it as a entry with the highest score will have to hand enter the but pretty soon be next to none as you and more entries in the have a couple different in access there is no case in you need to use not quite as elegant as the solutions in the more robust db engines and needs to be nested for this but it will get the job done for as could also do it using the sql to limit your as shiptoplant btst left join select shiptoplant from btst where shiptoplant not as abtst on you know vb you can also create your own functions and put them in the that is another
