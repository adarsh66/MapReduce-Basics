a bad way to grasp via but keep looking see alexandrescu start complaining about devs never understood that iterators are a modern pointer before dumping the jump to and still believe they have decent the problem is that all that iterators are is in complete odds at what the runtime platforms are trying to which can be but they said it once in the purple book and they said it even before and before very powerful concept but never so if you do it all the iterators are useful as they help with abstraction of another and is the place for an very you know code or in that other language linq massive framework 300mb runtime penalty indirection of dragging apps via heaps of instances of reference pointer is	
a bit but for debugging you can turn on the this will allow you to set up your own error the easiest way to set up said error handling would be to override this will terminate your but it will there may be things you can do to make this not kill your but this will depend on what platform deploying this at any never use this in pretty much going to have to have extensive error handling in one technique used is something like def def print your own error return def raise you use as a decorator on your it will automatically handle whatever errors happened within function is called for some exceptions in but is not getting called for other errors like importerrors import thisclassdoesnotexist in new to is this because of some distinction between and all errors are the reason why this is causing problems is because these errors occur immediately when the module is imported before your view is ever the first method i posted will catch errors like these for you might be able to figure something out for but argue that you have worse problems if getting importerrors in a production app not doing any dynamic tool like can help you eliminate these kinds of problems

a composite format string provided by the user use with and a set of types representing the arguments that would be used to format the composite format how can you check that the value is should be pretty easy to create a regular expression to check that the general syntax of the argument placeholders match per and not too much more difficult to verify that the indexes of the placeholders in the composite format string are less than the actual number of typed arguments they reference an argument that be given the types for the arguments that will be passed in are it should also be possible to validate the is appropriate for those you want to validate the user specify as a format string when the first argument type is a number yields the quantity of options by type is to want to manually check is there any other or do you just have to live with the user potentially specifying a bad format there are no custom or implementations in play just basic types already in the bonus points for addressing the custom do you validate a composite format string in against its target argument

a lot that i could write about of libraries i create my own versions of cpan with just the modules i the latest versions of has several such as the option to load to help with once you have you can distribute it on a or cd which has all of the the and everything else you with a little programming you create a script that make it all integration i integrate the the road to i do integration testing with the application which automatically tests all of its dependencies the switch to the cpan command is useful to test the module in the current working are various intergation testing frameworks that you can use you set perl5lib to something empty only have the core modules in the so has to install everything from control friendly it much matter what you most things have some sort of export where you can get everything without the source control git is very nice because it only has a minimum of pollution in the normal platform everything mentioned works just fine on windows and perl install this part is more and i think going in the wrong any time multiple things have to depend on the same someone is going to mess it up for the i definitely recommend not using the system perl for application development just so you mess up the operation of the at the every application should install all modules into their own directories so they compete with other start up just a simple matter of i use the wrong way to go since you have to depend what thinks you should i use which simply takes a directory of template toolkit templates and processes them to give them your distribution you can do anything that you how you get the initial templates is up to d

abstract class is useful when you need a substantial amount to be identical across the for example in cart with multiple methods of payment you an abstract class which defines a generic payment subclasses inherit from the superclass for each actual you want to support credit of how a payment is authorized would be different for but they all perform essentially the same function that a user can prove that they can pay for the goods in example of where an interface is useful is where you have that need to provide some similar functionality in a for you might have a cms where articles are stored in but where the system caches them to disc as well as until the article in the database is at which physical file is deleted until the next time someone access in the your cms might also support the ability to upload etc to be stored for access on the you definitely want these files to be deleted as the copy disc represents the file itself and not a cached in you could create a cacheable interface that says what methods which is cached to disc needs to while leaving it the class itself to implement this makes more sense that represent different kinds of data almost certainly implement their caching scheme class that allows caching would be defined as class which is something you can then check for less experienced coders might test the class of an are working with by getting the class and processing the a big switch this the correct approach means that assuming that certain classes objects and if you add a new class to the system to modify every switch statement in your software to take it if yo uimplement an interface you can test if an that interface with the instanceof instanceof manage approach is better because it eliminates the switch statement makes your software easier to if you add a new the system that also implements its own caching scheme then need to declare that it implements as the all classes to implement it to declare the methods the interface you can be sure that any class that will provide certain methods for you to your need to know how the class implements these just does implement concepts are somewhat trickier to explain than to actually use hopefully got the basic ideas across for you to figure them out for kumar

afraid standard stuff of is not what you you can try to change authentication module so it you in with what roles does your visitor perhaps you will use some special table that corresponds user and custom principal with user roles enumerated and assign identity and principal to the current also think that making special roles for each site is good when you would have hundred you would also have two hundred pretty i we were solving similar we were just not using standard we had single set of roles used on all membership of concrete user is determined according to current site and his relations to this another possibility to investigate is application that exists in authentication maybe possible to isolate each subsite into separate method that works for our not make a lot of cloned use only users and if your sites are public then role could be just global user on one site differ from user on another if and are different then of course should also be bound to a standard membership but do not use standard role a mechanism for storing relation between site and it could be simple table that holds site user is and you have to override is isinrole to be cover it this method is in iprinciple so you have to make your own principal quite isinrole of this type should look take current site look into the table and get you have to associate your principal with a do it in postauthenticaterequest is also honestly not sure when is it but it also have isinrole we can override it in the same but other methods of this provider are for example it accepts array of user names and but to what context should it be to not because i know when this method is so it requires some i see that ropeprincipal by itself uses roleprovider to fetch list of so maybe implement only using standard for our application this is not a so i say what problems could be hidden

all depends on how you use if you use gaia to make a website then pick apart the created code and figure out how it did the things it did then it will help you learn the flip side if you just publish websites using it and bother to pick it apart to learn the internals then it will simply be a crutch allowing you to never learn how to do it an ability to create something that you could not have otherwise and if you cannot use it again in the you will not have any clue of how to do it as a learning not just a building that was all general comment on building tools in specifically relating to gaia like to add that personally i think most top end devs make their websites much much better than the gaia framework as a matter of only recommend using it as a base learning then building your own framework that you can constantly improve on as you get

am currently doing a project for school and basically they want us to have this kind of structure all the data access logic the data from the database with either linq of standard a reference to the class library and offering that access the methods from the class a service reference to the web service and using the webmethods to retrieve the basically means that we cannot access the class library directly from the web class of course there are multiple solutions to choose from as to provide abstraction in the web service to separate for example methods that retrieve the articles and methods to retrieve the categories are two different entiries and have two seperate classes in the class can either do one web service which will have all the methods and the website only makes a reference to this one web but of course this will result in having all the methods in a single class a single web i can create multiple web services and reference all of them from the website and then call the one i need depending on what data i need to i mean for the above solutions are not really ideal because if i have the first i will have a ton of methods all in one class abstraction and in the second i will have to reference about 10 different web services from the website for one for school they told us to use the web service web to access the class and then retrieve the data from the class library using the but both solutions i mentioned earlier on seem a bit there a better way of how i might go about in implementing this a webservice as an interface for a data access layer in

am everyone it a bit confused about exactly what the goal is so give three possible answers that may cover what you actually the relatively simple goal of getting the script to read from either a list of files on the command or from its regular 0 exec from this point the stdin is redirected from the supplied on the command the use of is the best way to avoid problems with funny characters in filenames and unquoted both mess this the trick using here is a it fires off cat in the background to feed data from files supplied on the command and then we use exec to replace the stdin with the output from that seem to be what you actually what you seem to really want is to pass the supplied filenames or the stdin to a command inside the this requires sort of the opposite converting the stdin into a file a named whose name can be passed to the like 0 command goes command goes uses to launder the stdin through cat to a named which is then passed to command as an stdin is taken from the i think what you want to but not quite what asked which is to redirect the stdin from the supplied files pass stdin to the command inside the this can be done by combining the above 0 exec goes i think why actually want to do

approach to scalability is within a single scaling across machines is a tougher the short answer there scala and lift do anything to either help or hinder horizontal far as actors within a single lift achieves better scalability because a single instance can handle more concurrent requests than most other to i first have to point out the flaws in the classic handling bear with this is going to require some typical framework uses a thread to service a page when the client the framework assigns a thread out of a that thread then does three it reads the request from a it does some computation involving to the and it sends a response out on the at pretty much every the thread will end up blocking for some when reading the it can block while waiting for the when doing the it can block on disk or network it can also block while waiting for the while sending the it can block if the client receives data slowly and tcp windows get filled the thread might spend 30 of time it spends of its on that one jvm can only support so many threads before it really slows thread contention for entities connection pools and and native os limits all impose restrictions on how many threads a jvm can if the jvm is limited in its maximum number of and the number of threads determines how many concurrent requests a server can then the number of concurrent requests will be determined by the number of are other issues that can impose lower for threads are a fundamental limiting but not the only decouples thread from in a request does tie up a a thread does an action reading the then sends a message to an actors are an important part of the because they are scheduled via a pool of threads gets used to process messages within important to avoid blocking operations inside of so these threads get returned to the pool that this pool visible to the part of support for a request currently blocked on database or disk for keep a thread the request handling thread is almost to receive more method for decoupling requests from threads allows a lift server to have many more concurrent requests than a also like to point out that the grizzly library supports a similar approach without more concurrent requests means that a single lift server can support more users than a regular java ee

approaches that test the existence of are because there is no way to check whether a file exists and create it in a single atomic because of there is a race condition that make your attempts at mutual exclusion you need to use creates a directory if it exist and if it it sets an exit more it does all this in a single atomic action making it perfect for this mkdir echo is already exit all see the excellent you want to take care of stale comes in the only downside here is that the operation takes about a so it a function i wrote once that solves the problem using mutex open a mutual exclusion lock on the unless another process already owns if the file is already locked by another the operation this function defines a lock on a file as having a file descriptor open to the this function uses fd 9 to open a lock on the to release the close fd exec local pid pids exec for pid in exec return 1 locked by a done can use it in a script like echo exit you care about portability solutions should work on pretty much any unix offers some additional options and there is also

be the only real way to do this is through since i assume this is not an and i also assume you are looking for a managed i than https it is possible to use javascript to do secure hashing of passwords on the client to prevent revealing plain text passwords but this is only a problems with this approach replay attack is still a viable users with javascript enabled would be able to auth in this approach is a more complicated challenge response a along with the login the hash of the password challenge client the the hash of the password challenge must not be trusted in the page on the server and the problems with users with javascript enabled would be able to auth in this plaintext password must be stored on the server to validate the challenge and must be encrypted on disk or otherwise to be problem is not as big of a danger as it in fact when you instead use hash the hash itself is raised to the level of this point it is fairly secure to use a cookie to store a randomly generated login similar to their session but the server may want to encrypt using the referring ip as part of the iv or key to prevent other users from hijacking the i hope that provides a little bit of direction in the way of your

been a while since i worked with but assume no effective option to remove antialiasing around the edges when the reason is basically that pixels are to rotate an image an amount other than a multiple of 90 you need to use some kind of interpolation to estimate pixel colours where there really pixels if nothing in the library to specifically take away antialiasing around the have you thought about drawing hard lines in the background colour along the it should be easier to draw those lines without any

been on a team that uses the fj and i know of on one team it was used as a replacement for a library that was less on another it replaced google i also know some folks that copycat the source code from fj to roll their own my if you must use you should be using something like functional java to make your life it increase code quality or written in a functional style is more hence more the library comes and encourages the use immutable data which improves the library also encourages composition over which improves the reusability of your developers with more powerful tools are more in my experience developers feel that functions make programming easier and more happy programmers are productive potential points of more functional style of programming discourages mutable which eliminates a large class of more powerful abstractions lead to less which reduces the number of places where something is no reason to believe that performance would be impacted one way or the the provided datastructures are designed for ease of use and expressiveness rather than but written optimally for what they as with anything how you drive is more important than what for is a linked so it has random access and therefore you avoid it for those has by

best thing about scrum is exactly the fact that skills do get a bit the point is to avoid silos at all costs by spreading specialist knowledge across the team and letting people work a bit outside their comfort this is not for some developers are happy in their own narrow specialist field and such people are more of a hindrance in a scrum process than an whereas and people who are determined to get the job usually adapt very very well to it and are far more of the key benefits of scrum is to get the whole team actually involved and invested into the project instead of tackling their own special tasks and then riding off to the claim that for most this is a far more rewarding way of working than the conveyor belt of waterfall advise to boldly embrace the mixing of skills and having people come together to take down nasty problems instead of relying on specialist the result of teams consisting of motivated people can be

can store values smaller than 8 or 32 you just need to pack them into a struct and use unsigned int a can be 0 through bool b the stores 0 or unsigned int c can be 0 through unsigned int d can be 0 through most your compiler will round up the total size of your structure to 32 bits on a 32 bit the other problem like you pointed that your values may not have a power of two this will make for wasted if you read the entire struct as one you will find values that will be impossible to if your input ranges all powers of feature you may find interesting is a they work like a but share so if you write to one field it overwrites the if you are really tight for and you want to push each bit to the there is a simple encoding say you want to store 3 each can be from 0 to bit fields are because if you use 3 bits waste some values you could never set 6 or even though you have room to store lets do an are three example each can be from 0 to int one two three pack them together most we should think in base 6 each value is from so packed into the smallest possible space packs all the values into one from 0 could be any value from 0 there are no pack one 6 how it looks like encoding in base each number is multiplied by place like where n is the place at to int one pack int two pack int three schemes are extremely handy when you have to encode some fields in a bar code or in an alpha numeric sequence for human just saying those few partial bits can make a the fields all have to have the same if one field is from 0 through use 8 instead of 6 in the proper there is no requirement that all fields have the same

do not really agree to types in allow variable in question to actually dbnull is a way to say another this value considered to be since we a way do differentiate actually null or in native to our current runtime null in another system we nullable types and dbnull completely different distinction is only required if you do not know if your local variable has allready been fetched from the if you know that the variable has been fetched from the database it would be okay to identify null and the difference is that null in programming languages signals the absence of a value and null null is in databases the null indicates something more like an unknown therefore null null is false in null equals nothing at all because you cannot tell for an unknown value if it equals another unknown i am not sure if dbnull is implemented this way and evaluates to just tested it and dbnull does not behave as evaluates to true but should yield false with the semantic of the database

event is roughly but you can run into performance issues using this event to access rows because of the memory it this is essentially a scheme where the datagridview tries to minimize its memory footprint by sharing some state when possible between rows you access one of the shared which causes it to unshare state and possible performance a lot has been optimized but run into issues with using this event for one reason or if rowsadded works for you with no degradation of if you still have lots of you can derive from the datagridviewcell and datagridview to add custom cell types to the this is probably the most complicated way to customize the but it would allow pretty much any kind of cell manipulation event gives you a hook into the painting of a particular cell if you wish you paint something with before also a event which gives you special event as well but never used that so not sure if the shared memory state issue applies for the painting event it does

expressions allow you to write a custom machine in a compact to process a string of there are at least two reasons why using regular expressions is software development involves a lot of paper and careful regular expressions fit into this model very because to write an effective expression properly involves a lot of staring at visualizing the paths of the software developers would much rather hammer out and use a debugger to step through to see if the code is regular expressions do not support this working style very one of a regular expression is effectively an atomic hard to observe stepwise execution in a too easy to write a regular expression that accidentally accepts more input than you the value of a regular expression really to match valid to to match invalid techniques to do for regular expressions are not very or at least not widely goes to the point of regular expressions being hard to just by looking at a regular it takes a lot of concentration to visualize all possible inputs that should be but are mistakenly ever try to debug someone regular expression a resistance to using regular expressions among software developers i think chiefly due to these two

generation and maintenance but it is we have a number of legacy quite different degrees of reports in crystal reports these are designed for not necessarily but to be of a predictable layout and no possibility of us retiring them any time connect to existing stored procedures server to acquire their a lot of time has been sunk in getting these reports to look the actual creation of reports is mostly done via the api and exported to there are a number of locally developed and maintained applications that are stable and handle this process we like the fact that crystal reports is that our apps produce these reports that the pdf output is consistent and that when the crystal reports template is approved and it just are some big problems with this situation the biggest being that any changes to the underlying report templates themselves are a huge getting the crystal reports template to a point that users are happy is a royal hassle and can involve a long iteration of and myriad other that with crystal reports being a relatively rare skill and not one people want to admit we are trying to think up alternative thoughts started to consider and any others crystal reports 2008 offer any benefits over have others managed a migration away from and what the data access layer is well perhaps generate graphs via an excel service and then import them as graphics to a framework another has anyone tried anything like reporting services any have some rs skillz but another thing that people are loath to actually own up to knowing anything there any layout tools available with a for in the old would be called desktop if we have objects as images that could then be rendering i want to move to a solution where the users are in greater control of the underlying and whether this can be handled programatically within tools that we can provide to them and so that i can be coding rather than editing crystal reports crystal whether to what and

go two links trying to explain you how things i will try to explain it as shortly as i most of what happens inside a windows forms application happens in a single usually the same thread runs if you open you will see that has a line that looks like the you debug the application at any moment and examine the call you will see it will trace back to that run this means that a windows forms application is in fact a continuous run of the run what is run run is eating a message queue through which windows sends messages to run then dispatches those messages to the correct which themselves do things like add text which corresponds to the key being redraw notice that all this happens during and endless loop running alongside a single so weather you are typing or simply moving the window loads of those messages are being passed onto the which in turn is processing them and reacting all in that single controls can also send messages to themselves through the queue and even you can place messages in the pump via one of the things those controls do is to raise events according to what if you click a the code written to handle that click will ultimately and indirectly be run by the what is happening with your code is that even though you are changing the visible status of your progress bar to visible and then updating its you are then changing its visibility to all in the same this means that only after you leave the will be able to continue iterating and consuming the message effectively asking the progress bar to update its when that already left the progress visibility to the last thing you did before exiting the is a quick and dirty workaround to your problem as it reads the messages in the queue and processes i really feel comfortable using it as it can bring reentrancy threads is a good but i would recommend using a threadpool thread instead of a custom thread in this kind of as i tend to use custom threads only in cases where i have a limited number of long lived threads and i need to control their life the easiest and most practical way to use threads is to use the backgroundworker even though i would recommend going through the pains of understanding how to do windows forms multithreading with delegates if you want to really understand what is going	
goal is to get a query i have three b and the tables are written such that and this basically allows me to write a query where i link a record from a to and link the b record to a record from so far so simple my problem one of the columns included in the query call it has to have unique the values in this column can only show up once in the query but other columns from the other tables do not have this anybody help me write this is the table layout i have to use generic acol3 bcol3 ccol4 the unique value constraint in i would write the query like and but of course that make sure the that values in are a and table b have a one to many a is the b is the b and table c have a one to one tables are part of a caching so lots of data that looks but is still different in some a is the most of the duplicate values will be found in first need to order the rows by but then after that i only need the first rows where the value for does not appear in a previous row for that that make things a little or am i still not making any chose bartosz answer as it was the closest to what i i just had to modify the nested join clause in the you all for your query with unique column

had this intermittent issue when using my site is dynamically sometimes when i modify a user control my web site complains that it is defined in multiple it almost seems like the old control did not get removed from the temporary files and the updated control is compiled to the same directory so defined in multiple that would make sense to me except for the fact that i have no control over what is in the temporary files read that having circular references will cause made sure that i have circular even with the simplest site seen this noticed that when using master pages this error seems to come up a lot more read that a hotfix tries to fix this issue but gotten this error after applying the i get the file causing the issue and make an edit to it then the error goes even if i just put a space in the file it will resolve the can also get the error to resolve sometimes by visiting other pages of the site that might not use the user control and hitting this does not always i set the site to debug the error never if i set it so that it comiles on a page by page basis then the error does not happen as much but still is what the error looks an error occurred during the compilation of required to service this please following specific error details and modify code error defined in multiple using using even though the error above says i got that error from another source since i reproduce the issue every but the type of error is the gisresearch for your there was one statement in the link you caution even if you have is that if you go in and change something in one of your aspx this page will have to be but this cause an appdomain reload so the whole application is not batch compiled this has the effect that the page will now get recompiled separately and get its own so change your aspx pages on a live server too is a setting in determining how many recompiles are allowed before the app domain by default it is set to so after 15 recompilations the app domain will just as it would if you touched the or touched the bin seems to say that when and the site has already been visited and if you change a page it will only compile that one that sounds like it could cause i had thought changing a page or user control would cause the entire app to is defined in multiple places

handmade jvm would be a great way to learn about virtual machines in the issues of program language design the jvm and the nitty gritty of parsing and so you choose to take it in that you could also explore which is where it can get and you can take research papers and implement their being if less interested in the long and arduous task of creating a vm from you might want to modify an existing open source vm like it will show you what a virtual machine but not necessarily how java code works in is a clean room implementation of the java virtual plus the associated class libraries needed to provide a java runtime you could study the but dive in to implementing more interesting

have a background myself and have been researching open source frameworks for the last few i still made up my recently been looking at seems to have the best of both worlds a easy to open source rad mvc framework on an enterprise it uses the groovy scripting language but runs on the jvm so you can use full java framework if you tons of prewritten java components out there to tap this thing is pretty be able to port your existing app pretty need a tomcat webhost you need straight php performs pretty well but most of the frameworks are poor if go with straight php no be using the traditional page based but feel more at you can roll your own dal with pdo and use stored need a templating system stay away from smarty which uses own templating slow and why do you need to learn a seprate templating i never got use savant it uses php for template language and is you can mimick with this too by creating a template page for each site as far as mvc a new php framework called yii that claims to have the best performance out there for php well documented probably the best the php framework out there if coming from feels enterprisey like zend but without the poor most of the others are or really slow like symphony and php works great with not a lot of tuning or maintenance unlike rails and you need an go with use the php version and install will feel inferior to vs but not a mysql is the sexy pick but postgres is it has one db engine that does it with some features you want are in innodb and some are in if you need foreign keys and transactions you have to use use myisam for fulltext search and faster read postgres performance has greatly imnproved with the version 8 release as mysql and has a nice windows installer

have a class of data with a very large number of binary to be i am concerned with how to model this data despite the internal efficiencies of storing as my programming spidey senses are tingling at creating a table with 151 addition to other will not be a large number of 1000 and once sent into production will not change very thought of categorizing my data into disjoint subclasses and creating separate tables but splitting the properties in this manner is impracticable and even if possible certainly would not map effectively with the data the other issue is like to keep all the data together and avoid field row i have also considered using some custom binary format but this is not workable as the key field in my data is used as foreign keys in other will make heavy use of where clauses to extract relevant considered using multiple longs or int fields but rejected this as unworkable since i know of no or functions in sql and as noted classification of the properties is not to mention other major software engineering issues this will be using my question here is do i just make a table with a huge number of fields or are there other methods compatible with the relational structures with a large number of bit

have a couple of one way is that you could say that a word is characters and then take a substring of that append the to the end and display or you could run though the string and count the number of if you assume that there is only one space between each of the then the 100th space will be after then 100th append the ellipsis and you are one has better performance would likely depend upon how the functions are most likely the substring operation is going to be faster than counting the the performance difference might be negligible so unless you are doing this a counting spaces would likely be the most accurate way to just as a the average length of a word in the english language

have a repository data access pattern like query members void void void the scenario where i have a repository of users have a user name which is if i create a new user with a username that exists i have a dumb ui layer that when i add it to the all is when i hit my repository attempts to save the item to the my database is enforcing these rules luckily and throws me back an aborted exception due to a unique key seems to me generally this validation is done at the layer above the the layers that call it know they should ensure this and will and execute in some kind of transaction scope to avoid but always seem possible with the medium ignorance that my repository be enforcing these what happens if my medium is such as a flat database without any integrity if the repository is validating these kind of how would they inform callers about the violation in a way that the caller can accurately identify what went exceptions seem like a poor way to handle this because their relatively expensive and are hard to specialize down to a specific been playing around with a for canadd with add will call canadd and throw an invalid operation exception if can returns a canadd also returns a list of violations about what went this way i can start to stack these routines through the for the service layer above would also have a method that would return the repositories report any additional violations it wanted to check as more complicated business such as which users can invoke specific of data is such a fundamental yet i feel there is no real guidance for how to handle more advanced validation requirements additionally in this how do you handle validation of entities that are in the repository and are updated via change for repo var user you could this will cause an going deeper down the rabbit imagine got a validation system in place when i add the and i do something like repo var newuser new so far so var otheruser this validating when adding the user was as actions could screw us up the add validation rule would need to check the actual persistence storage and any items queued up to still stop the previous change tracking so now do i start to validate the save changes it seems like there would be a huge amount of violations that could happen from aparently unrelated asking for an perfect safety in my repository enforce validity of if where and

have created an iphone app where you start in a navcontroller and after a couple of levels you select an option from the table and an animated view pops in that has a tabbarcontroller at its is a completely seperate view that replaces the you tab around and when you want to go back to the options screen you press back and another animated transition plays swapping back the navigation controller removing the tab bar controller and releasing problem comes with releasing the if you press the tab buttons to switch between tabs it seems you continually increase the reference count for the view then when you call release on the tabbarcontroller reference it will only release the view controller of the selected tab or any tabs you viewed and it takes one of the retain count on the others tabs this means you leak all your model custom cell objects etc from each of the other tabs that were not an example of what i am if you create a new template tabbarcontroller project in xcode and add a viewwillappear method to the first view controller that prints out the retain count for start the app and press back and forth on the first and second tab buttons and watch the log the retain count just keeps i am wondering if there is a way to release a tab bar controller and have it release all of its view controllers at the same for view controllers in tabbarcontroller releasing a

hit a lot around the problem but going to mention the underlying problem of which this is just a your data model is almost certainly if you plan to be doing much sql development you should read some introductory books on data one of the first rules of normalization is that entities should not contain repeating groups in for you have columns called is a much better way to model this kind of table contacts int not not constraint primary key clustered table int not not not constraint primary key clustered constraint check in instead of trying to concatenate a string to deal with different columns you can deal with them as a set and get at the phone numbers that you want through business that i use your but it seemed a bit too general and hard to	
honestly do not know why so runs like it on privately owned i can assume why a website would prefer when things go you want to be on the and solve it as quickly as without needing to count on some of course the downside is that need to be available to handle these cloud hosting any external for that is very convenient for a small to and most of the hosting providers today do give you the option to start small hosting for and grow to private but if you truly believe you will need that extra growth you might want to count only on your own with your own you are bound to any restrictions or limitations a hosting service might impose on run whatever you hog your cpu or your your many hosting providers do not give you this freedom you pay of course this is a and each business will handle it	
hope is not lost it possible to raise an event on a com object from outside of the this functionality is actually provided by com although in an indirect events work on a a com object that has events publishes and one or more other com objects subscribe to the event by attaching an event handler to the source object handlers are called the source object raises an event by simply looping through all the event sinks and calling the appropriate handler how does this help it just so happens that com lets you query an event source for a list of all the event sink objects currently subscribed to the source once you have a list of event sink you can simulate raising an event by invoking each of the sink event the details and being liberal with some of the but the short somewhat politically version of how events work in can take advantage of this knowledge to raise events on a com object from external in it is possible to do all of this in with the help of the com interop support in the and wrote a utility class that will allow you to raise events on a com object from pretty easy to here is an example using the event interface from your legacycomobject new the following code assumes other com objects have already subscribed to the myobj message event at this vb6 objects have two hidden interfaces for classes that raise one the default two the event we want the second because it gives us a that we can use to raise the the method is a convenience that returns all the objects listening to events from the legacy com set up the params for the messagedata cancel raise the event by invoking the event delegate for each connected sink in raise the event via the event ref do cancel processing an is the code for the class well as helper because paranoid and wanted a nice way to deal with the needed by the thoroughly tested the code the code performs manual memory management in a few and therefore there is the possibility that it could introduce memory leaks into your i add to the because this is only an use with com a utility class for dealing with com needs and could potentially be into a regular i extensively tested this there may be a memory leak somewhere due to the stuff going on in the but i think i covered static class get a list of all objects implementing an event sink interface that are listening for events on a specified com event sink com object whose event sinks you want to list of objects that implement the given event sink interface and are actively listening for events from the specified com public static sinks new connectionpoints loop through the source connection find the objects that are listening for events at each connection and add the objects we are interested in to the connectionpoint in connections foreach connection in object candidate i tried to avoid relying on for but returning an empty catch need to release the interface pointer in each connectdata because getconnectiondata implicitly foreach connection in return get all the event connection points for a given com com object that raises list of iconnectionpoint instances for the com private static connectionpointcontainer oneconnectionpoint new connectionpoints new int fetchcount safeintptr pfetchcount new if fetchcount if while return returns a list of connectdata instances representing the event sink connections to the given iconnectionpoint to return connection data list of connectdata instances representing all the current event sink connections to the given connection private static oneconnectdata new connectdataobjects new int fetchcount safeintptr pfetchcount new if fetchcount if while return class a simple wrapper class around an intptr manages its own class safeintptr private bool private intptr allocates storage for an int and assigns it to this the value defaults to public allocates storage for an assigns it to this and initializes the memory to known value this that this points to public gets or sets the value this pointer is pointing public int get if throw new pointer has been return set if throw new pointer has been returns an intptr representation of this public intptr return deallocates the memory for this public void if if class namespace

humbly suggest that on some compilers on certain architectures the following could reduce more effectively than constant get many of the comments have a compiler will do a good job of optimizing a loop for you optimization people have spent lots and lots of time thinking about legible code is probably more but you really want to optimize beyond what you think a compiler may be able to i suggest looking at the assembly that the high level language and consider further optimizations from a high you may also be able to get significantly greater performance by using openmp or on a lower level by way of a vector instruction set to do multiple computations in a single a bit beyond the scope of the and have to give a lot more information about what the doing for useful advice on that helps

i believe that is what talking i believe the problem to be the iframe and not the combination of the draggable and i have this same issue and it also manifested itself with a prior implementation using the prototype implementation uses an iframe as a canvas on which to drop the way you can see the bug is to move your mouse too fast so that the cursor leaves the edge of the draggable the div stops moving and your mouse keeps by moving your mouse back to the surface of the it picks up the div again and starts moving even if released the click on your suspicion is that the iframe events somehow interfere with the jquery solution was to position a transparent div tag between the iframe and the this the iframe never sees the mouse movement and as such see code i revisited this issue and the iframefix seems to work great in all browsers for the but the resizables do not have the equivalent used this code to manually add a mask it as a mask over the iframe to prevent ie from stealing mouse mask when dragging the is a 1x1 pixel transparent fixes the issue for ie7 ie6 has trouble with and seem to figure out that the div should be between the iframe and the resizable i gave up on

i bind gridview to then the first time page will be gridview will display columns retrieved from data but if on postback i set to null or to an empty protected void eventargs if then gridview display any rows at but why is gridview has enableviewstate set to then it should be able to display rows it retrieved from data source when page was first realize one could argue that framework notices that datasourceid has changed and assumes gridview need data from previous data but assume framework would realize that empty string or null reference point to any of data source and thus remove any data gridview retrieved from previous data what is going on is once you have set the datasourceid to null or an empty string the control takes this as an indication from the consumer of the control that they do not wish to bind any data at all viewstate the control checks the datasourceid prior to binding and if it is an empty string then it does not databind in its ensuredatabound if you set datasourceid to null inside but gridview only checks datasourceid moments before binding which happens much after then until datasourceid is viewstate containing data from previous data source should still be available inside and still an event handler subscribed to an event that caused a datasourceid to causes gridview to

in many issues related to programming it all find that one really should first try to define your api so exceptional cases can not happen in the first design by contract can help in doing here one would insert functions that throw an error or crash and indicate a programming error user some cases these checks are removed in release keep you exceptions for generic failures that can not be avoided db connection optimistic transaction disk write exceptions should then typically not need to be caught until they reach the and will result in the user to need to try the error is a user error like a typo in a name or something then deal with that directly in the application interface code since this is then a common error it would need to be handle with a user friendly error message potentially translated layering is also useful so lets take the example of transfering cash from one account an other int int double amount this is an internal function we require the client to provide us valid arguments error handling done design by contract argument amount do the actual transfer int int double amount start string if msg return common checking code used from multiple if msg return if amount return amount this could fail with an exception if someone else changed the balance while this transaction was unlikely but return transfer

interested in i solved this differently than many of the solutions presented times the dictionary and word prefixes into a to 1 the averaging under 10 dictionary load times on the web host server are running about 1 to seconds longer than my home know how badly the times will deteriorate with a load on the wrote my solution as a web page in using the dictionary referenced in the original are not reused in a only words 3 characters or longer are using a hashtable of all unique word prefixes and words instead of a i know about so i learned something the idea of creating a list of prefixes of words in addition to the complete words is what finally got my times down to a respectable the code comments for additional the class avoid using a 2 dimensional array in vb not using typical iteration to find have locked the code into a 4 by 4 grid laid out like find paths the code starts with a letter from a to p the paths available around if a neighboring exists in the path then we go letters are hard coded is a list of only valid paths a word prefix or word is not found the path is and extending that path is dim paths as new the keys are the letters a to value is a string of letters representing neighboring string of neighboring letters is split and iterated dim neigborsof as new the keys are mapped to the lettered grid of a to values are what the user inputs on the dim boggleletters as new to store last postition of this will be a a to dim lastpositionofpath as string found a hashtable was by far faster than a about 10 times this stores prefixes of words and determined 792773 was the number of words and unique prefixes be generated from the dictionary this is a max number final hashtable will not have that dim hashtableofprefixesandwords as new words that are dim foundwords as new to validate what the user enters in the dim errorfoundwithsubmittedletters as boolean public sub thispath as is the word correlating to the thispath path would be a series of letters from a to dim word as string path is iterated through and a word based on the in the boggle grid is for i as integer 0 to word my hashtable of word prefixes and words contain this this a word and any further extension of thispath will any words so exit sub to terminate exploring this if not then exit value of my hashtable is a boolean representing if the key if a word a prefix if true and at least 3 letters long then word if andalso 2 then my list of paths contain thispath then add only valid paths will make it this paths not the hashtableofprefixesandwords cause this sub to exit if not then the last letter of we are looking to extend the our neighboring letters if any are still lastpositionofpath through my list of neighboring letters grid for each neighbor as string in i find a neighboring grid point that i already thispath then extend thispath and feed the new path recursive if not then end protected sub sender as byval e as handles has entered the 16 letters and clicked the go up my of grid using letters a to p an grid the values are neighboring letters the user user entered something with a length of 1 for all 16 for each s as string in if 1 errorfoundwithsubmittedletters exit end input is not valid if errorfoundwithsubmittedletters error assume we have 16 letters to work with and start finding dim sb as new dim time as string dim numofletters as integer dim word as string dim tempword as string dim letter as string dim fr as streamreader fr new fill my hashtable with word prefixes and while word tempword for i as integer 0 to letter optimization helped quite a words in the dictionary that letters that the user did not enter in the grid go in my realize most of the solutions went with a never heard of that is one of the neat things about seeing how others approach learning some best i code a trie in my i just have a hashtable with words in the dicitonary file and all possible prefixes for those trie might be faster but not coding it getting good times with if i 0 andalso not then continue tempword if not tempword end end of word prefixes and words in time time starts a path at each point on the grid an builds a path until string of letters correlating to the path is not found in the word prefixes and time of words end end	
interesting issue which googled and can find absolutely no reference perhaps because too vague on the cause have a simple jsp page that is run from a struts 2 fairly javascript but its an internal app on my intranet so thats not a great seems normal so but the last few tags on this page fail to this is true for all browsers tried it in i mean by not rendering is that they simply exist when you view the whats in half a tag declaration is actually printed as text at the bottom of the all very what makes it even if i put a few tags after the then all browsers render down past the but still cut off the last few anyone ever heard of anything like i even know where to start i know my description is vague but only because a bit vague on it few html tags not

is a good question does it assure there is conflict between stack allocation heap is a single contiguous address space in almost all so the stack and heap allocated memory do have to coexist in that each time the stack grows and shrinks this is not done with individual heap you can still think of the stack as a single large block of memory allocated from the if the stack grows beyond the boundary of that then we have a stack overflow someone should name a website after a each time a thread a new stack has to be allocated for and when a thread dies the stack can be and it would make sense for those blocks to be allocated using the same heap management as is exposed through very approximately speaking you can think of the stack as being a type of object that coexists in the a whole stack is all in one when a thread starts and then it gets suballocated and then it gets in one you can you like to live the same virtual memory apis to find out about the stack and to force virtual page within it to be

is actually a really excellent and the short answer is we used to do it that and there was a whole area of enterprise in the common ood notations evolved from we was that designs like that had some the biggest of them being that the natural structure for a data base necessarily match well to the natural structure for to a great derives from the desire to make it easier to find a code structure that has a couple of desirable should be easy to think out the should be robust under ease to think out design comes originally from which used what we now think of as for simulation it was convenient in simulation to have software entities that correspond to the things it was only later that alan kay et al at xerox saw that as a more general structuring part about robustness under changes had many but one of the most important ones among them was dave you wrote several papers that identified a basic rule for which i call every module should keep a and that secret is a requirements that is likely to turns out that by combining law with the simula idea of a as corresponding to something that can be identified with the real you to get system designs that are more robust under requirements changes than the old way we did and sometime you have to be as with the most objects are thing that have persistent in the command the ideal objects are things you it also turns out that that structure necessarily a good way to represent the underlying data in a relational so we end up with the relational impedance how to represent the transformation from objectland to

is almost certainly simpler and safer to use a well tested external library you can find google than to code a filter since you said anything about you the format of you there is little more that we can tell know anything about how your ide but importing usual takes one of three forms depending on how the library is made available to you to obtain source for one or more functions with good read the copy the code into the appropriate add the files to the attempt to fix missing preprocessor obtain a plain binary library and headers for you from you os package management read the tell the ide where to find the headers and the attempt to fix obtain a framework that provides the this is a bit more but it also starts with read the then probably proceeds a lot like the library but with more code to be any case you will at some point be some of your source files to make the external functionality visible to your you want to find a candidate library to see what form it is provided then read more about your ide to see where you go from so question that might be relevant to your been a long time since i used but if that is your base programming you should be aware that there are of facility that matlab provided to you that are not in plain vanilla you almost certainly want to use some framework or another to give you some of that support

is an annoying as it has two meanings which are easily first meaning is a series of most of these correspond directly to the unicode character of the same characters outside the basic multilingual plane are stored as two each one of the languages use in this sense for internal storage including as a native string this is the usual source of phrases like uses as its default is accessing the elements of such a string 16 bits at a time at the implementation as a next thing to consider is the encoding of such a string into linear for storage in a file or network as always when you store larger numbers into there are two possible or so you can use the encoding of into or the is the more commonly just to add more confusion to the windows gives it the deeply misleading and ambiguous encoding name in reality it is almost always better to use for file storage and network streams than either of if you know whether a bunch of bytes contains or you can use the trick of looking at the first code point to work it this code the byte order mark is only valid when read one way so you mistake one encoding for the of not caring what byte order you have but using a bom to signal is usually referred to under the encoding when someone says you tell whether they mean a sequence of unicode code or a sequence of bytes in unspecified order that will decode to has the same you know what encoding to use when you create a specify one and will use the actual direct quote it is a constructing a streamwriter without an encoding argument explicitly to give you	
is an excellent personally found that modifying a database schema and converting all the data to the new representation to be far more difficult than refactoring so much in that whenever i start a project that will use a new database i always take time before i sit down and write any code to get my spec as thorough as what this often entails is anticipating features and incorporating support for them into the even if i plan on immediately implementing might be able to be a bit more nimble with database refactoring if using a framework or other similar layer that provides a mechanism for altering the but if writing straight sql then i would recommend investing a modest amount of time designing and implementing a schema that is less likely to require changing in the

is definitely common practice to compile c code using a compiler in order to do stricter type though there are tools to do that like it is more convenient to use a a compiler to compile c code means that you commonly have to surround your includes with extern blocks to tell the compiler not to mangle function however this is not legal c effectively you are using syntax and your code which is supposedly is actually also a tendency to use starts to creep in like using unnamed you need to keep your code strictly you need to be

is nothing special about c and other is a remarkably unambitious its goal more or less to create a portable assembly anything more advanced than has no place in the as there is to learn from in no way a difficult but it requires a lot of work to achieve even the simplest and it is of course very and unsafe compared to higher level is a remarkably complicated it has had a lot of different influences over the and has stolen ideas from a wide range of languages and programming and then in the last decade or this has been topped off by the community pretty much inventing their own paradigm as has come up with some pretty clever solutions to a lot of common all as much as people like to look down on i frequently miss it when working in there are a number of techniques and abstractions that are cleaner and more elegant in so from a pure language i think is worth i wish javas or designers had bothered to do rather than basing their languages on what can be more accurately described as with i think what getting at is that learning these languages will give you a better understanding of going on under the can see the point in gives you pointers which can be mapped directly to the underlying memory learning these languages certainly gives you a kind of intuition about going on as always with not always one of the most common mistakes in is to assume that are memory in many ways they behave but pointers obey a lot of additional constraints that may or may not exist in the actual for these why not go directly to the learn learn about the cpu learn about of the above is worth and will make you a better but learn for the sake of the language not but there are lessons to be learned from and learn about all the underlying mechanics the hardware running the by studying those whatever you go definitely you should learn the languages you actually work but stop learn almost regardless of what it more or a better understanding of the underlying all make you a better think of as the in particular may be one of the hardest languages to but that mean those who know it are the best far from

is the behaviour as it is defined in the css box collapsing this the collapsing margins means adjoining margins padding border areas separate of two more boxes may be next to another or combine to form single horizontal margins margins may collapse certain or more adjoining vertical margins of block boxes in the normal flow the resulting margin width is the maximum of the adjoining margin in the case of negative the absolute maximum of the negative adjoining margins is deducted from the maximum of the positive adjoining if there are no positive the absolute maximum of the negative adjoining margins is deducted from margins between a floated box and any other box do not of absolutely and relatively positioned boxes do not rationale behind this might that if you set a margin on you just want to ensure that there is at least this much space left between the border or padding of this element and the border or padding of the next element two you want the margin to be contained in the div making the div you need to set some padding or border at the top and bottom of the

is to race to really ensure uniqueness requires additional one suggestion from the activerecord rdocs is to create a unique index on the for example by including in your will ensure at the database level that the name is but a disadvantage to this approach is that the exception returned on attempting to save a duplicate is not very one cannot be sure when catching this exception that the error was generated by a duplicate record and not just by broken as the rdocs is to parse the message that comes with the exception and try to detect words like or but this is kludgy and the message is database backend for my understanding is that the message is totally generic and cannot be parsed this way at that this is a fundamental problem for activerecord it would be nice to know if there is any standard approach to handling these i will offer my suggestion please comment or provide can i determine if my activerecord object violates a unique database

java it help if got a very and the only reference to the an object is via a local setting that local variable to null when you need it any more when the method is going to continue to run for a long help the this is very rarely useful as the gc takes possible into that optimization may make it to java some time i if got a member field referring to an object and you no longer need you could potentially aid gc by setting the field to my rarely useful to do either of these and it makes the code very few methods run for a long and setting a variable to null really has nothing to do with what you want the method to not good practice to do it when you need and if you need to you should see whether refactoring could improve your design in the first possible that your method or type is doing too that setting the variable to null is entirely passive it inform the garbage collector that the object can be it just avoids the garbage collector seeing that reference as a reason to keep the object alive next time it	
javascript ecma language description impose a requirement for the particular implementation of regular so that part of the question really wondering about the particular implementation in a particular reason etc use a slower is that the regex language defined regular a real regular expression can be expressed as a finite state but the language of regex is context why the fashion is to just call it instead of talking about regular in fact javascript regex consider the syntax using that matches from to accepted let the difference the syntax means there exists a string that is but a string that is it follows via the pumping lemma for regular languages that this is not a regular thinko

key is in understanding how the line b given how your code is this line is the equivalent of b that is the order it will execute the assignment happens before the the first effect of this line is that and both refer to the original object the portion will be inside of the operator we increment the of the original at this point and are both pointing at the with a of and will continue to do created a new object inside the operator method and returned it as the output of the will now be updated to point at the newly created now points to a new while continues to point to the why the writeline output appears pointed the operator is meant to do by generating a new breaking that operator overloading on objects is a tricky and this is an excellent example of why better avoided in most for the assignment does not actually happen before the increment when dealing with operators on but the end result is the same in this the original object reference is the operation is carried out on the and then the copied reference is assigned to the just easier to explain if you pretend that assignment happens really happening is that b in due to how the operator works on copy x new original balance is a now points to the new copy still points to the b b and copy now point at the

make it truly you need to initialize the members at construction way i to do this and avoid a huge parameter list in the constructor is to have a mutable type that has the same set the the properties on the mutable type one at a through then pass the mutable object to the constructor of the immutable type as a single the immutable object then copies the properties from the mutable source to own might also consider that even though immutability is not enforced by the you use coding practices that clearly separate the initialization phase from the usage after immutability is not required for can take this a step creating an wrapper for the interface that expose the properties of the the wrapper only implements the methods in the by delegating to the the setters and getters from the implementation are not present in the this will stop clients from simply from the interface to the implementation class and manipulating the	
make sense to talk about variables in because nothing analogous to a declaration in the languages designed for compilers have declarations because the compiler needs to know in advance how big datatypes are and how to access different parts of if i say in the compiler knows that somewhere there is some memory set aside for and as big as it needs to be to hold a pointer to an eventually the linker will hook all the references to but at least the compiler knows out there typically set an initial value for something least in the familiar compiled if exist before the then i guess you could call this a since that is when ruby has to assign a value to the symbol is a specific term that people typically use to distinguish the static assignment of a value to some variable from that in you have that kind of you typically just say a variable is if been assigned a value somewhere in your current and you say if it usually talk about it having a because in ruby that just amounts to no special context that would justify you saying like there is in other brings us can definitely call this an since it is assigning a value to the symbol i think anyone will disagree with

me take a crack at first written some on this subject in an orm or plain specifically to address your of is about if you know sql the learning curve for ibatis is ibatis does some things on top of sql such still need to learn but the biggest hurdle is includes on the other hand tries to distance itself from sql and present things in an object rather than a relational as joel points out are and jpa is no to do jpa still need to know about relational performance tuning of queries and so ibatis will simply having you apply the sql you know or are jpa will require you to know something how to configure it xml or by this i mean figuring out that foreign key relationships are a relationship or of some the type you know sql i would say the barrier to learning jpa is actually if you more of a mixed result with jpa allowing you to effectively defer learning sql for a time it put it off jpa once you setup your entities and their relationships then other developers can simply use them and need to learn everything about configuring this could be an advantage but a developer will still need to know about entity transaction managed vs unmanaged objects and so worth noting that jpa also has its own query language which you will need to learn whether or not you know you will find situations where just do things that sql is a hard one to personally i think more productive in ibatis but also really comfortable with some will argue way more productive with hibernate but this is possibly least in unfamiliarity with the productivity with jpa is deceptive because you will occasionally come across a problem with your data model or queries that takes you a half a day to a day to solve as you turn up logging and watch what sql your jpa provider is producing and then working out the combination of settings and calls to get it to produce something both correct and just have this kind of problem with ibatis because written the sql you test it by running the sql inside sql server management navicat for mysql or after the query is all doing is mapping inputs and i found to be more awkward than pure you need separate tools to just run a query to see the results and something more you have to i actually found this whole part of jpa rather awkward and unwieldy although some people love danger with ibatis here is proliferation meaning your dev team may just keep adding value objects and queries as they need them rather than looking for reuse whereas jpa has one entitty per table and once you have that named queries tend to go on that entity so are hard to queries can still be repeated but i think less of a potential comes at the cost of rigidity often in an application you will need bits and pieces of data from different with sql easy because you can write a single query a small number of to get all that data in one hit and put it in a custom value object just for that jpa you are moving up that logic into your business entities are basically all or now not strictly various jpa providers will allow you to partially load entities and so forth but even there talking about the same discrete if you need data from 4 tables you either need 4 entities or you need to combine the data you want into some kind of custom value object in the business or presentation other thing i like about ibatis is that all your sql is external xml some will cite this is as a disadvantage but not you can then find uses of a table column relatively easy by searching your xml with sql embedded in code where there is no sql at it can be a lot harder to you can also cut and paste sql into a database tool and run i overstate enough how many times this has been useful to me over the i think ibatis wins hands straight sql and low by its nature jpa simply be able to manage the same level of latency or now what jpa has going for it is that latency and throughput are only rarely high performance systems however do exist and will tend to disfavour more heavyweight solutions like with ibatis you can write a query that returns exactly the data you want with the exact columns that you fundamentally no way jpa can beat even that when returning discrete of think this one is a win for ibatis like i mentioned with jpa you will sometimes spend half a day getting a query or entity produce the sql you want or diagnosing a problem where a transaction fails because the entity manager tried to persist an unmanaged object could be part of a batch job where committed a lot of work so it might be nontrivial to of them will fail if you try to use a table or column that which is you mention portability as one of your requirements moving between database worth noting that here jpa has the the annotations are less portable hibernate xml standard jpa annotations have an equivalent for id but both of them are more portable than ibatis seen jpa hibernate used as a form of portable meaning you run a small java program that creates the database schema from jpa with ibatis need a script for each supported downside of portability is that jpa in some lowest common meaning the supported behaviour is largely the common supported behaviour across a wide range of database if you want to use oracle analytics in no in a

mentioned counting the number of set bits in a byte as a programming question in his guide to and talked of a way to take advantage of patterns that occur in the lookup i wrote an article about it awhile back after i found the of bits set in a byte in 1 1 2 1 2 2 3 1 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 2 2 3 2 3 3 4 2 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 3 3 4 3 4 4 5 3 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 4 4 5 4 5 5 6 4 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 5 5 6 5 6 6 7 5 6 6 7 6 7 7 first row and column are exactly the and each position in the grid can be calculated by adding the first values in that row and because of you only need a lookup table with 16 entries for an and can just use the first 16 if you wanted to count the set bits in the number for just 243 16 15 243 16 are there six bits set in the number 11110011 next pattern i noticed after that was that each time you double the size of the nxn each quadrant could be calculated by adding and 2 to each like make a 4x4 grid on the and fill in the upper left quadrant with the values of the 2x2 for each add the value from that same quadrant in the 2x2 grid to the upper left quad add 0 to each number from 2x2 1 2 upper right quad add 1 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 lower left quad add 1 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 3 lower right quad add 2 to each number from 1 1 2 2 2 3 2 2 3 3 3 this process two more and get the 16x16 grid from so i figured there must be some sort of quadtree algorithm that would allow you to start from the given a number generate the lookup table on the fly and figure out the number of so my you figure out an algorithm to do just of set bits in a

my understanding of your have a point on the specified as direction is the direction that a person at that point would travel to reach the north pole by the most direct possible that the north is tangent to the surface at your chosen point and points directly parallel to a line of direction of the motion will be tangent to the surface at your chosen have an angle in degrees from true north which specifies the heading at which this point is going to angle is the angle between the north and the direction of motion of the want to calculate a vector that is tangent to the surface at that point but perpendicular to the direction of motion of the understood all that you can do it as north at latitude longitude is given by vector perpendicular to the north which points along a line of latitude the is given by these two vectors identify the plane tangent to the and the vector specifying the direction of motion of your point is also in that your motion vector is a linear combination of the previous where is your heading find a vector perpendicular to that motion you can just take the cross product of the radius vector the vector pointing from the center of the earth to your with the motion math would be best to let the computer handle

myself am one of these types of who never learned coding in a formal but am by the use of copy and paste and works available through gpl projects and premium is often the way commerical script companies show you how to or update code in their script paste this on line this are my understand how what i do but i am getting good at what i do with though i feel because of my informal learning that i lack in some of the really but necessary principles of web coding in ins and outs of i feel as though i have started from the inside of understanding the practical and lack the basic and theorized understanding of what i am also know quite a few others who are the who started learning in the same communities as and are pretty much at the same point as feeling as though something big is missing from the see the lacking in my discipline when i attempt to use php authoring which i find very challenging to and this is becoming a downfall on the time frames in which i complete my to hand code i also find it difficult to ask for help at for lack of the specific language that comes with and being able to use the right words to explain the intricacy of my was a hairdresser by i worked as a and hotel a business consultant by been learning web development slowly now for 3 and i have taken on quite a few commercial projects over the past 2 but obviously feeling some lacking in my skills overall id like to ask any experienced coders had similar beginnings to give me an idea on how i can adapt my coding disciplines to be more effective and what would someone with such an informal understanding of programming want to seek to and what are the things i must know as a and what is a basic overview of the whole feel free to direct me to help is always just to give a round up of my actual i am a i do author my own code from and sell my i can write php and use have a good working understanding of html and am very good in the design and am learning as i am using jquery in most of my thanks for all of the answers so for the copy paste generation of

not afraid of using you can make your function a template and use sfinae to check for the two typename will create a method for every type that extends both feature interfaces that the sfinae trick is not needed for it to an unconstrained template would but just fail to compile when you pass a type that meet the possibility is to create an interface ifeaturexy extending and use this in the function this has the drawback that types that implement both but not this joint interface would not be usable with this you can pass two arguments to the one per and require they are pointers to the same this is but could be hardened by making some template class to hold the two pointers which would be initialized by the single object in question and which would hold the two you could probably do the same thing with bounded type variables they allow multiple not sure

not sure if entirely clear on the implications of attaching to events in is my current correct or attaching to local class events do not need to be new event eventhandler onmycustomevent delegate assuming that when your object is disposed or garbage the functions are deallocated and would automatically detach from the attaching to objects you no longer need have to be detached to a elapsed which you only respond to i would assume you need to store the timer in a local variable so you can detached the elapsed event after the event declaring the timer in a local method scope like so would result in a mydatatimer new new attaching to events in a local object to your class does not require if you had an observablecollection that your and lets if you attached to the collectionchanged event using a private this function deallocate when your class is garbage causing the observablecollection to also be sure i have places where stopped using objects and have failed to detach from an event the timer example i so looking for a clearer explanation on how this what cases are detaching from events

of the problems with statics is that you have no control over when they are instantiated as your program is in debug the compiler does many things differently than it does in release one of those things is how it manages is quite likely that you are simply getting lucky in debug that your memory is not being overwritten by other processes and the value is there when your program wants approach used to great effect is a variation of the meyers is very nicely detailed in in the singleton pattern you are not after a the approach can be used to solve your problem as static const static return primary benefit is very nicely explained by nakamura in the above construction relies on the fact that objects are only initialized when the function is first being called thus we maintain the benefit of dynamic primitive variables like static int do get translated during compile time

only way i think this is achievable is through something similar to multiversion concurrency protocol used in databases such as this guarantees that readers block writers block but writers block only those writers which update the same piece of this property of writers blocking the which update the same piece of data is important in concurrent programming otherwise inconsistencies are for each and every write operation to the data structure you take a snapshot of the data structure or atleast the portion of the nodes affected by the write operation to a different location in the memory before doing the so when the write is in a reader thread requests to read a portion of data from the writer you always refer to the latest snapshot iterate over that there by providing consistent view of data to all the are costly since they consume more but yes for your given this technique is the right one to go and yes use locks to protect the write operation from other writer needing to update the same piece of

optimization tricks use are generally the same tricks use for a normal just with a faster turn around some things you can look into doing get requests that have high odds of being loaded by the a caching layer in between as mitch wheat depending on your technology you can look into quite common and there are libraries for just about at denormalizing data that is going to be queried at a very high assuming that reads are more common than you should get a decent performance boost if you move the workload to the write portion of the data access opposed to adding database load via delayed inserts to give priority to writes and let the database server optimize the sure you have intelligent indexes on the table and figure out what benefit if rebuilding the indexes very frequently due to a high you may want to scale back the at retrieving data in more general queries and filtering the data when it makes to the business layer of the mysql uses a very specific query cache that matches against a specific it might make sense to pull all results for a given even if only going to be displaying look at running asynchronous queries to the database if possible within your data synchronization to be it just needs to appear that way of the common pages on in a fully formatted state so that the server have to do much processing of in there are of things you can do they generally come down to general development practices on a more bite sized

point to daniel disadvantage of anonymous inner classes is that no one can ever use it anywhere whereas a named inner class can be used only by the class that created it if made a small but it does mean that you can help ensure that an inner class is not accidentally recreated using the anonymous inner class gives anyone reading your code a harder time as they then have to parse this class that came out of using a named inner class you are able to organize the source have seen cases where there are two anonymous inner classes with the exact same in guis especially you may have multiple controls performing the same this can crop up i am talking production not code that my students have readability issue goes both some people find anonymous inner classes better as it lets you see what is going on in once others find it a that part comes down to personal making an class static is more if you are declaring an anonymous inner class in an instance then there will be more if you need access to the instance is wasteful probably not worth worrying about until it presents as a personal preference is to use classes as they allow for more flexibility when the code is modified

read a few questions on so as in regards to versioning your data within a liked some of the suggestions that were i have for the longest time wanted to revision many of my tables but never got around to being a programmer with only simple database work under my belt i was wondering how one would actually go about doing not asking for the actual solution in sql i can eventually figure that out for myself post so when the time just asking for people to comment as how they would go about doing it and any potential performance problems there might be if i was to hundreds of million of or any other suggestions as long as it is based on the example a simple uint not uint not not date not not uint not uint not not uint not uint not date not not null not sure how one would link the audit table to any other tables as if the tablename is a assuming that i have three to full record for a specific person table view listing all persons view showing each person with their revision info below each entry of revisions per dates of revision ordered by the most recent accomplish 1 and would it be better to query the person table or the audit accomplish would a so called database expert simply get all records and pass it on to the software for or group by personid and affected is this usually handled in one query or data

really say this is an issue as long as they can easily look up the change log to see whats thinking if no libraries have been updated in any of the nor have there been any changes to the product itself the version number should stay the only suggestion i could make is moving to a dated version number so that the major and minor versions change so something like would be the 17th of april 2009 release with the build number of yyyy and xxxx as the svn if you want to change the major number and want to keep the date in the minor you could use versioning a good blog article on how microsoft do their versioning at

sometimes useful to be able to read properties or invoke methods of a class without knowing what properties or methods a class has at design the way to accomplish this is with as demonstrated by the code you can get a list of all properties on a class and retrieve their values without knowing anything about it at compile or you can get a method by even if you know the name of the method at compile and invoke it via this would allow for to create a scripting language that operates on objects defined in another course you can also enumerate all methods in a class or retrieve a specific property by but these cases are not demonstrated in the code static void userdefinedclass udc new is the property classtracer ct new 1 object public public void get a list of all properties implemented by the pis foreach pi in public void string mi if new arg1 private string public string return userpropertyvalue public void

suggest some push the good thing about stringent it policies is that usually this means there is an established process for updating the determining the process can be especially if also you talk directly to the other any doubt source control is a best the policy of disallowing access to a common source control repository is not a best a neutral 3rd party that only provides source control might be the best solution of hits for you could probably even arrange for svn hosting on port 80 via so no firewall adjustments would be also suggest to the pm to add x minutes per task due to the overhead of not having shared source repositories even add a weekly the source repository for a couple of certainly consider spend some time and effort in tracking the effort involved in the process the process only eats 1 hour a week still an important amount of time to just will you be running a continuous integration server with this maybe being pessimistic but expect lots of broken builds because of merge and pretty much each time it will look like the party i wonder if this scheme precludes ci another best

the definitive i wrote about the differences between maven and ant in the introduction the section title is differences between ant and an answer that is a combination of the info in that introduction with some additional simple only showing you this to illustrate the idea at the most basic maven has a simple ant build simple example build set global properties for this build create the time stamp create the build directory structure used by compile the source compile the java code from into the create the distribution directory put everything in into the delete the and directory trees this simple ant you can see how you have to tell ant exactly what to there is a compile goal which includes the javac task that compiles the source in the directory to the you have to tell ant exactly where your source where you want the resulting bytecode to be and how to package this all into a jar while there are some recent developments that help make ant less a experience with ant is in coding a procedural language written in the previous ant example with a maven in to create a jar file from some java all you need to do is create a simple place your source code in and then run mvn install from the command the example maven that achieves the same all you need in your running mvn install from the command line will process compile execute unit create a and install the jar in a local repository for reuse in other without you can run mvn site and then find an file in that contains links to javadoc and a few reports about your source this is the simplest possible example a project which only contains source code and which produces a a project which follows maven conventions and require any dependencies or if we wanted to start customizing the our is going to grow in and in the largest of projects you can see collections of very complex maven poms which contain a great deal of plugin customization and dependency even when your pom files become more they hold an entirely different kind of information from the build file of a similarly sized project using maven poms contain is a jar and source code is in ant build files contain explicit is source is in javac against this the results in a jar from the where ant had to be explicit about the there was something to maven that just knew where the source code was and how it should be differences between ant and maven in this have formal conventions like a common project directory you have to tell ant exactly where to find the source and where to put the informal conventions have emerged over but they been codified into the is you have to tell ant exactly what to do and when to do you had to tell it to then then have a you had to define goals and goal you had to attach a sequence of tasks to each goal has it already knew where your source code was because you followed the it put the bytecode in and it produced a jar file in is all you had to do was create a file and put your source in the default maven took care of the has a which you invoked when you executed mvn this command told maven to execute a series of sequence steps until it reached the as a of this journey through the maven executed a number of default plugin goals which did things like compile and create a about so someone like steve loughran is going to read that comparison and call going to talk about how the answer completely ignores something called ivy and the fact that ant can reuse build logic in the more recent releases of this is if you have a bunch of smart people using ant antlibs end up with a well designed build that even very much convinced that maven makes happily use ant ivy with a project team that had a very sharp build that being i do think end up missing out on a number of valuable plugins such as the jetty plugin and that end up doing a whole bunch of work that you need to do over important than maven that you use a repository manager to keep track of software suggest you can use nexus to proxy remote repositories and to provide a place for your team to deploy internal have appropriate modularization of software one big monolithic component rarely scales over as your project want to have the concept of modules and maven lends itself to this approach very adopt some conventions for your even if you use you should strive to adopt some form of convention that is consistent with other when a project uses it means that anyone familiar with maven can pick up the build and start running with it without having to fiddle with configuration just to figure out how to get the thing to

there is a difference in how the objects are but they are not python allocates a where it can quickly allocate dictionary objects it dictionaries allocated via the syntax a c call to can come from this free when the dictionary is no longer referenced it gets returned to the free list and that memory block can be reused the fields are reset first dictionary gets immediately returned to the free and the next will reuse its memory you keep a the next dictionary will come from the next free x we can delete the reference to that dictionary and free its slot del the syntax is handled in it can use this optimization mentioned on the other hand is handled like a regular class constructor and python uses the generic memory which does not follow an easily predictable pattern like the free list looking at from python with the syntax it seems to the hashtable based on the number of items storing which is known at parse

think got more problems than just the dot not matching but let me start with a formatting you can use just about any punctuation character as the regex not just the slash if you use another you have to escape slashes within the i understand is popular among that would make your pattern the reason that regex work as you intended is because the dot loses its special meaning when it appears inside a character class square just matches a dot or a what you were looking for was but i would have recommended matching the as well as the because the word can refer to the or any given web page may contain any of those or a mixture of two or more a mix of and is very but with mode known as or dotall you need to worry about another problem with the original regex still present in this the is that if more than one sequence in the the first time your regex is applied it will match all of from the first to the last the simplest way to fix that is to make the ungreedy or by appending a question i know what to make of the before the opening quote of your pattern i do but that looks like a syntax error to if someone could educate me in this appreciate

think i would find a way to make the data consistent rather than allowing users to enter inconsistent perhaps your management app could allow the manager to select an existing image or upload a new then set the name of the image based on this input so that be assured that the image will only remove an image when all references to it have been removed from the restrict the interaction with the data to your app so that people make those sorts of way to handle this would be to have a handler a controller in that does the image lookup based on id and returns the image coupled with caching this could be very efficient and would allow you to do image replacement as

think reach for a tessellation true that in most case where these are used the aim is to reduce the number of vertexes to optimise but in your case you could parameterise to retain all the detail and the possibility of optimising may come in are numerous tessellation algorithms and code around on the web i wrapped up a pure c on in a dll a few years back for use with a delphi landscape and they are not an uncommon subject for advanced graphics coding tutorials and the

think that code needs to first and readable and optimisations that are should not be at the expense of optimisation is often a or not you should optimise your code depends on your application if you are working on an embedded processor with only 8mb of then optimisation is probably something that every team member needs to keep in when writing code optimising for space vs optimisation is not useful unless your system has been clearly and this is because most programmers do not make good optimisation decisions unless they can factor in the influence of the overall including processor architectural factors such as cache hardware

think the best solution here is to break up the address class into two address information person information it would be fairly simple in the person class to compare the core address information without creating a this does create a bit of coupling in your code because person will now have a bit of inner knowledge about how occupiedaddress but these classes already have tight coupling so really made the problem no ideal solution would be to completely decouple these

think the delegate relay is what you it would let you use the published which is usually recommended rather than overriding functions not really supposed to know i agree that it does seem messier than it should have to but if the hooks in uiscrollviewdelegate are what you need for your customizations then it sounds like your best can also provide your own custom delegate to whatever uiviewcontroller is using your scroll view to do some view specific logic

think the main issue you have to watch out for is upgrading once you upgrade to a new version of visual you will be forced to upgrade your project files as once the upgrade is complete the file will no longer be compatible with previous versions of visual this means that you will break anyone who is using the previous version of vs to the best advise is to upgrade the entire best way to work around this is to keep 2 versions of the project file one for the previous version of visual studio and the other for the this obviously has a bit of and once you actually start using new language features this will no longer be a sufficient as the new features likely compile in the old versions of visual

think the trick is the following going to do it in base because but the principle should you are multiplying mod 1234 12 100 5432 54 100 12 54 10000 34 54 100 12 32 100 34 54 10000 648 54 100 1836 32 100 384 32 x 10000 x the first and last terms become the second and third terms are where the come note 18 100 100 18 10000 3600 3618 is essentially a circular giving the results of 648 3618 8403 and also note that in all the multiplied numbers are a 100 and b so this is calculable if you only could multiple 2 digit numbers and add going to work out with a and both are 32 suppose you want to multiply them mod but you only have a 16 bit multiplier 32 the algorithm would be something like a b accumulator for for do the temp add the bits to the shifting over the right x for bits bits accumulator do modulus if it if accumulator so the accumulator part of that probably i think in principle right someone feel free to edit this to make it this is pretty as which is what the prng x x

think there is a way to do not exactly like that since this is a private field and you control it you can just declare it private myclass also make sure in all your code that only objects that implements myinterface are affected to and cast everywhere you need to access it as the it looks and it is could also create the following derived class myderivedclass extends myclass implements myinterface then use private myderivedclass is much but you have to create an other just for that

think this is a the safety mechanism that exist in winforms throws an exception if in the debugger and you try to access the ui from a thread other than the appropriate you sure that the event being called that sounds extremely if you put a breakpoint on the event handler in the does that break point not get answer your question in a different way i make the entire event handler execute on a specific there may be more than one handler and those handlers may need to execute on different i would make the event handlers themselves code them so that if they need to perform some action on a particular they do the marshalling back to the thread with thread is most of your network access taking place i would hope not of the ui threads involved otherwise you can get an unresponsive that would mean that if it was working probably already doing the appropriate very none of this could you try to come up with a short but complete program which demonstrates the easier to diagnose concrete code	
think with the second query going to do an inner loop to run the subquery for evaluating against each row in if that is the this means you might have something like on that i would personnally go with the first but if it were that important to i would do some performance make sure you test against very large data sets as well to get a good idea of how the performance something that runs at is faster for very small but something that runs at is much better for large data

this area seems to be really fragmented and no clear or solution there are some worthy is really easy and effortless for getting a basic ui mockup up and it is free for one project is more of a ui mockup tool rather than for you can create ui screen mockups very quickly with a wide range of ui they have support for maintaining it is free a 5 min nag but also incorporates with eclipse and other is one of the best tools for ui prototyping and thus very recommend starting out with protoshare with their free if all you need are ui balsamiq is really the best free option out

this might be an overkill for a small but more this could be a nightmare to maintain when there are changing features and documents are constantly this can be very hard to the way it happend on a couple of very large projects where i worked to this kind of quality level was to be extremely harsh on adding new requirements to the current work this means that the requirements stay stable and it is not too hard to keep all the acceptance test in it is still a full time job for several admin staff and a daily overhead for every engineer i am talking here about loc requirements are only admited after rather lengthy the process is basically there to make the customer think very hard about adding a new requirement to the current adding requirements to future versions is but to add one to the current phase is there is a fixed fee payable just to a requirement and get it read by an architect and presented to a change control once this is done a quote is given to the customer if the new req is complex the quote may be just for further investigation and not even a commitment to implement the it is then up to the customer to decide whether or not to and if they do then the team undertakes to do the work and adds the req to the fixes the adds new test and so the schedule may also need to be adjusted at this approach might not sound commercialy feasible if your organisation needs to be open to new if this is the case then you can still have tracking and a managable level of overhead if you go for frequent that way your current version stays stable as you work on it and you can keep the matrix and docs up to if your customers have new requirements they can add them to the for the next but you keep them out of the current when it comes to the next version you take on all the new ideas and spend time creating a new matrix only after the previous version has do the gurus say about are some these are just personal i read anything specificaly on cmm so point you there by is worth reading i think you mentioned but worth repeating i but i think software might be most relevant to it is a collection of some of which are online at the above 13 case for better software seems to be the kind of thing you are and are 2 of the they really touch on the specific issues you mention and are too early for but if you read them i would try to make time as they provide great also seem to recal published a lot on software quality this day the space shuttle is regarded as an example of probably they highest final have you read any of the or

this should be if you need to require a default case which would require you should consider changing to a of the core design guidelines for structs do ensure that a state where all instance data is set to or null is see design just looked this section up in the design guidelines 2nd and they have an example in detail there using properties and overrides to work around as the basic concept was to save the value privately in a way that 0 is the and do some form of transform in every property and method override in their they used a positive integer as an and always save in the private so the default value is treated like a value of they added a constructor with an int and save seems like a lot of unexpected though so personally still recommend a class in this edit in response to comments as your is the way it is because 0 at datetime uses a ulong to represent ticks from that is why datetime value type represents dates and times with values ranging from january 0001 anno domini through december 9999 is the full range of ulong in a in the struct of datetime is treated as when you convert to a string the values 1 1 a single

thought i could work this one out myself but i seem to be moving forward at the need to create a huffman tree of codes from the information provided by the dht huffman header in a jpg the dht header defines the huffman table in this a series of 16 each byte defines how many symbols have a huffman code of n amount of bits where n is the position of the byte in the that make any for example the raw data in hex 01 05 01 01 01 means of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 16 of 00 01 05 01 01 01 01 after the list of 16 bytes come the actual symbols for 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0a combining the two parts we see that their 00 codes with 1 01 codes with 2 so take the first symbol from the 05 codes with 3 so take the next 5 symbols from the 01 02 03 04 and so finally we have to work out the actual huffman codes from the information if a mathematical you may have spotted already that these codes can be worked out by simply incrementing a binary number with the appropriate number of bits for every new code at a certain bit when the bit length simply increment the binary number and then double it and carry it becomes obvious to everyone else when drawn out a number of these binary trees by so this is the code i used to work out the huffman codes and store them in an i read the data at and put it in an int binarycode count stringbuffer codestring new array with code for contains the number of codes that have a certain number of for the binary number into a 0s until the code string is the right the created huffman code in an count binarycode binarycode i have generated the huffman codes and stored them in i can just add the symbols that they refer to in order as they come along in this may not be terribly elegant but it seems to work at least and creates the correct if anyone is still following you deserve a now the problem is like to store this information in a binary tree so that i can efficiently decode the jpg image data later rather than searching through arrays unfortunately i figure out a nice clean and efficient way to do this directly from the information provided in the jpg headers as only way i can think of is by working out the huffman codes as above then implementing some method that creates nodes as needed and saves the symbols in the appropriate using the codes as an address of however this seems such a round about way that is also duplicating the information i sure there must be a much better and simpler so if anyone understood my be very grateful for some i realise this is a very specific but if nothing else the info above might prove helpful to i am still very new at this so excuse my easy to understand code is especially to create huffman tree from ffc4 header in jpeg

two key patterns in my experience and singletons which gradually grow over this could include poorly implemented and used connection dictionaries of user seen since from objects to objects which were to be in this can happen with and the equivalent observer pattern could give the same sort of effect in basically if you ask one object to watch another then you usually end up with a reference the source the that can end up being the only but live as long as the leaks if you keep generating new code on rockier ground but pretty sure run into problems this possible this was partly due to jre bugs which have since been fixed been too long since it happened for me to remember for tests which hold onto state can last longer than you might expect because junit will hold onto the testcase again i remember the but sometimes this makes it worth having explicit in the anachronistic as that say that regularly found memory leaks to be a problem in java

unix development nice little black box of is losing market share to more modern technologies and development there are certainly many great ides out there today with support for web development like visual and many web developers find them unnecessary and continue to work entirely in standard text editor like vi and unix platform has a very rich selection of contemporary web development frameworks ruby on and django are two of the most popular you could develop an application using one of these frameworks without the use of an ide entirely from the command both of these frameworks are open and run on a variety of unix and gnome desktop has several accessibility features that might aid you in your the on mobility in the gnome desktop accessibility guide might be the most relevant for that would give you the best of both worlds in that have a very rich commandline but could also run gui apps and ides such as macos x might give you a similar you find the benefit from the ms accessibility features in windows too great to perhaps consider installing and learning to use my understanding of is that it allows you to execute many gui based tasks entirely from the commandline you to interact with windows in a more unix like

used with boolean operands the operator is a logical operator just as but the difference is that the operator does short circuit evaluation and the operator does means that the second operand is always evaluated using the but using the operator the second operand is only evaluated if the first operand evaluates to result of the expression is always the same for both but if the evaluation of the second operand causes something else to that is only guaranteed to happen if you use the a b x 0 here b is still as the operand was not y 0 here b is as the operand was evaluation of the operator can be used to write shorter as the second operand only is evaluated if the first operand is instead of writing like has to be at least three else if has to be at least three can write like null has to be at least three second operand is only evaluated if the first is so you know that you can safely use the string reference in the second operand as it can not be null if the second operand is most cases you would want to use the operator rather than the if the first operand is there is no need to evaluate the second operand to get the a lot of people know that you can use the operator with boolean so they would get confused when seeing it used that way in the

was made to make writing a compiler it does a lot of stuff based on that one pointers only exist to make writing a compiler as do header many of the things carried over to are based on compatibility with these features implemented to make compiler writing a good idea when c was c and unix were kind of a c ported unix ran in this c and unix could quickly spread from platform to platform whereas an os based on assembly had to be completely to be concept of specifying an interface in one file and the implementation in another a bad idea at but not what c header files they are simply a way to limit the number of passes a compiler has to make through your source code and allow some limited abstraction of the contract between files so they can header really offer any advantage over another by putting more effort into the you can compile a reference object as easily as a pointer to the exact same object this is what does is a simple it had a very limited feature and you could write a compiler without much porting it is generally not trying to say a bad language or just that primary goals when it was created may leave remnants in the language that are more or less unnecessary but are going to be kept around for seems like some people really believe that c was written to port so first version of unix was in assembler but intention was that it would be in a first tried in 1971 to fortran on the but gave after the first then he wrote very simple language he called which he got going on the but there were because the implementation it was always going to the basic notions of which was based on the just were not right for machine like the used the to add to which for a while was called for and then he started write a compiler for that first phase of c was really these phases in short succession some language changes from adding the type structure without much change in the and the ritchie second phase was he of rewriting unix in started in the summer of 1972 but two figuring out how to the basic that how switch control from one process and the difficulty in the proper data since original version of c did not combination of the things ken to give up over the ritchie the i structures and probably made compiler code somewhat better better code and so over the that was when we made concerted effort and actually did the whole operating system in is a perfect example of what i from the only exist to make writing a compiler pointers exist because the simplest possible abstraction over the idea of adam rosenfield hour are in order to implement pointers are the simplest possible abstraction to in no way are they the simplest possible to comprehend or arrays are much to implement arrays as efficiently as pointers you have to pretty much add a huge pile of code to your is no reason they have designed c without but with code like will take a lot of effort the compilers to factor out the explicit and additions and make it create the same code that this would out that variable after the fact is new compilers can do but back then it just and the os running on that crappy hardware needed little optimizations like few systems need that kind of optimization work on one of the slowest platforms and most of our stuff is in and in the rare case where you might need the new c compilers should be smart enough to make that kind of conversion on its

was thinking of using the system date but it can be changed by the worry about generally have some mix of three goals when writing you either sell it yourself or write it for someone else in exchange for a you want people to actually your ideally you also enjoy writing software for own more time trying to restrict who can use your software is not can only serve to reduce your user and i argue in my linked post that it actually reduces the amount of money you can make from the in other completely counter to what trying to will grant that in this specific scenario you may have you do have a legitimate interest in expiring beta and your platform is susceptible to clock i have an older pocketpc that is always losing and whenever that happens the system date is reset to it happens so often i always bother setting the year any i just make sure the date is current within the but spend too much time on	
was writing a function to figure out if a given system of linear inequalities has a when all of a sudden it started giving the wrong answers after a seemingly innocuous undid some and then proceeded to fiddle for the next two until i had reduced it to inserted anywhere into the function but nowhere else in the fixes for a school so i probably post the function on the but this is so ridiculous that i think any context is going to help and all the function does is a bunch of math and it even touch memory that allocated on the help me make sense of the loathe to chalk it up to the since the first rule of debugging is not to blame the but about running mac os on a g5 and the compiler in question identifies itself as but thinking it could be an curiouser and i diffed the files with nops and not only are there too many differences to but with no nops the file is and with should have posted the i came back to the code with fresh and immediately saw the see my sheepish fixed with four nops in an world no longer makes	
way of handling this is to load that list of methods at runtime into a and then for each use the that something like this this code is simplified and omits error extends methods method if when you want to call look up the method in the by argument type and use that show this again with simplified but this time full note that to be fully the code gets a little more as is shown if you have to worry about primitives depends on your or if you have to worry about interfaces or then you can simplify the example if you can guarantee that there will be no overlap in interfaces or superclasses in the arguments that you have to worry you can move all of the complicated logic into initialization matter if it takes 1 ms in this all of the logic in would be moved into the where you would loop over all interfaces and superclasses of each method you find and add them to your if you do this then becomes a single without this optimization and with full my example of how to do class test private final parametertypemap new private final tests new new new public methods for method if clazzes if if see private void if else if and so on for the other six primitive types public void for test method method if found for try catch private method method method if return look for x while null x method if return x look for for i method if return return public static void test test new setters public void public void public void public void public void	
way that you should set up your development should be as your normal development in labwindows source use and for your interface to use i have been using tortisesvn with vs2008 and vs2005 for a while and i find that it is just your normal development in vs2005 or vs2008 and link to the measurement studio libraries supplied by national you will have the option of using or whatever your heart you can also integrate other libraries or such as and you would get the added benefit of framing your questions in terms of microsoft technologies vs national instruments where the support is much can integrate subversion with visual studio through a number of addons but i prefer to use 2 is nice because you are able to use the best of all visual studio measurement studio roll your tortisesvn

way to solve your problem is to attach a guid or similar type of data to a user and check for a valid session when the page is if there is you redirect to a page saying that this url is not available at the and that the user will soon be redirected then redirect to home after 5 seconds or so using it would work like the user is a session cookie is created with for example a the is also stored in a database in which you have one column for the primary key and one for the you also create an authentication thus logging the user on to your all datacalls etc are the user has been successfully registered and so you redirect to the confirmation the confirmation page is the user is automatically logged on you created the authentication cookie in step you can then check for a row in the table corresponding to the logged on if there is such a you delete the and display the confirmation page with all the if there is no such you display the error message and as you deleted the row when you showed the message the first the user will not be able to access the confirmation page if you use this approach some other that makes the confirmation page available only you should make sure that it is clearly stated on the confirmation page that the user be able to access that page

working in a company in austria talking and we are programming in english domain makes it a bit more because you have to find the english translations and you have to translate the gui before releasing the not really sure if all the names are really contrast in the former company i was working for programmed strictly in this was pretty nice german words tend to be longer than english after some years the company wanted to use the same program in the so programers had to use the same after this everything got pretty database in both languages english speaking team members talk experience is that it is easier to handle internationalization in the early beginning are forced to do it when you write the program in of an because it is no big fun localizing a 10000 loc the advantage of writing in another language is that you see instantly what is localized and what is not altough work you have to take in account for the untranslatable we expierienced that yet altough it was some work finding the english phrase for an eu but if that would happen pretty sure we would use the german	
working in delphi delphi but my question is language you have a which sends messages to another i assume tclient instances would have a private reference variable of type a method somewhere in tclient would create an instance of tfacade and assign it to this private the tclient client class would need to use the tfacade tfacade works with other classes them and presumably tfacade instances do the same have private workerclass and create instances of the workerclasses in the tfacade tfacade classes need to use the workerclass how does information get from the workerclasses back to if tclient is a for it might receive user input which is used by in used by the after workerclasses have manipulated or used they need to communicate information back to tclient output information will be displayed in the tclient hope this is basically just asking if class1 calls a method in and class2 calls a method in how does class3 send information back to since i am a be afraid of being too simple or too specific in your i can handle it as always al communication between	
working on a 2d game where trying to accelerate an object to a top speed using some basic physics the pseudocode for float acceleration float friction value is always float velocity float position velocity velocity position is a very simplified approach that rely on mass or actual friction friction is just a generic force acting against it works well as the part keeps the velocity from going past a certain this top speed and its relationship to the acceleration and friction where a bit like to do is set a top and the amount of time it takes to reach then use them to derive the acceleration and friction float int if my game runs at 60 like a moving object to reach in exactly 2 float acceleration float friction

working on a windows app that periodically has to launch operations which may take some gotten into a pattern of having these operations run on a and writing up a quick winform for each where you pass in to the form the necessary the form wires up the backgroundworker and makes the function and the form displays the output bar text fills up with this form is very the only part that really differs between form copies is which method is called on which so what love to do is make it whereby we can take the pass in an object null for static a function and an array of and have it just from been able to do this with the thing we like about reflection in this case is the lack of things like the method call are caught at and not compile is there anything available now that might make this more elegant and heard of people talking about things like delegates and expression but not sure the former applies and still a little in the dark about the the background

writing a system as the client is asking for a convenience your credit card told them that this is in all likelihood a i did have a good idea just and seeing that good ideas in are actually bad ideas i thought put it up for review here and see what holes can be punched through thinking of the credit card information plus some message signature using a one time pad generated per this pad is stored as a cookie variable on the next time that user tries to place a the pad is sent to the and if the server can properly decode its encrypted it shows the credit card information as already being cc info actually transmitted the server will never store the pad in anything more than memory or page in i intend to have the pad be sent once upon arrival on the cc page the server checks if it should ask for cc and once on cc submission to get the actual user will also be instructed that their information is in their cookie meaning that they will expect that if their cookies are their cc information is me know where you think this scheme is horribly client credit stored on server but with one time pad encryption stored in client

written a few of these a couple of things you should as mentioned by you want some kind of this is important for a number of but the main one is that it gives you additional flexibility in case your servers going and you decide users should be credited with an additional day of free just push back their value by a this also makes free trials simple to use stuff like automated recurring even if working on a subscription you want to be in full control over when the payment gets and offloading that responsibility to your gateway is just a bad idea in most most gateways will allow you to store a credit card on their give you back an id for that and you can issue charges against that intermediate id instead of the card log all i overemphasize this in you should probably expose this log to the user as basically just a table of all of the payments the and the final common to put invoices into this table as invoices have a positive payments and credits have a negative and just sum everything for the user to obtain the final you can introduce arbitrary credits to this table very easily if so a cron script that fires every 24 hours that checks what users need to have an invoice this cron script should have three critical if it run for some you lose a worth of if it runs more than once in a or if it gets aborted through and it charge people and if the date on the server gets changed to 2090 by it automatically bill all of your users for millions of resets to dates in the past jan should also cause it to raise daylight in my is rarely an think that covers most of the big but there are always little gotchas in billing systems that you have to watch out	
written an application in that moves jpgs from one set of directories to another set of directories concurrently thread per fixed the code looks something like string destination directoryinfo dir new directoryinfo subdirs foreach d in files foreach f in the performance of the application is horrendous tons of page the number of files in each subdirectory can get quite so i think a big performance penalty comes from a context to where it keep all the different file arrays in ram at the same such that going to disk nearly every a two different solutions that i can think the first is rewriting this in c or and the second is to use multiple processes instead of the files are named based on a time and the directory they are moved to are based on that so the directories they are moved to would correspond to the hour it was for are creating a background worker per directory for poor performance with multithreading with heavy

xp your maximum program address space is then you have fragmentation due to and drivers loading up in to your address you have the problem of your heap best move is just to get it over with and run as a process a suddenly all these problems go you can use a better heap to mitigate heap fragmentation and you can try using virtualalloc to grab your memory in one big contiguous chunk then you get to manage it from to discourage from fragmenting you can split your bsp across complicated and and frankly just putting it on disk would be but in theory you could get better performance by having a group of processes exchanging if you can keep everything resident assuming you can be smarter than memory than the os can handle file which is a big each process would need far less memory and therefore run in to the 2gb address space of burn through a lot can mitigate the effects of fragmentation of the address space by allocating smaller this will have other nasty side but you could follow a backoff policy where you grab smaller and smaller chunks of memory if you fail to successfully frequently this simple approach will get you a program that works when it otherwise but the rest of the time performs as well as it computing just sound so much nicer than the other

years ago i reverse engineered game copy because the protections was written in c or they were fairly easy to disassemble and understand what was going but in some cases it got hairy when the copy protection took a detour into the kernel to obfuscate what was a few of them also started to use of custom made virtual machines to make the problem less i spent hours writing hooks and debuggers to be able to trace into the environment really offered a competetive and innovative i had everything at my disposal save misstakes caused reboots and very little feedback what went i realized thinking before acting is often a better i dispise if the problem is in code visible to me i find it easiest to use verbose the error is not understanding the then debuggers are i have also realized time is of an you need to have a good working environment with possibility to test your code if you compiler takes 15 your environment takes 20 sec to update or your caches takes 5 minutes to clear find another way to test your progress keeps me motivated and without a good working environment i get angry and	
years ago i worked on a web site that grew in popularity beyond our initial expectations and it got us in trouble since we were all relatively inexperienced in web based projects it posed a significant strain on us about what to do beyond usual database separation onto separate load balancing day thought of something pretty since site was based on their profiles were stored in a database table the usual way someone would do it user lots of info variables and stuff like that which would show up as a users profile page which other users could look flushed all that data into a simple html already prepared as a users profile page and got a significant boost basically a i even made a system that when user edited their profile it would parse original html put it up for and then flush out html back to the file system got even more made something simillar with messages users sent to each basically wherever i could make a system bypass a database avoiding a insert or i got a significant it may sound like a common but it was an enlightening it is not an avoidance of relational setup per but it is an avoidance of the database altogether	
years just as i was getting started with i ran into some programming games in the style of crobots think it actually was but a clone of which were pretty cool to play around gotten a feeling of is not which i would rather get rid so i figured what would be better than to challenge my colleagues to a competition of who can make the best with many different levels of and many different preferences with regards to programming i would rather not tie the competition to a single the ones i found after a late night of googling seem to be tied to a single and even the ones that are based on java seem to have problems trying to use jython or other languages in theory should there any games of this type out there that is not restricted to a single there any crobots style games that support robots written in more than one

you add parenthesis to the end of a function you execute that when you assign a function pass it as a parameter to another you need to omit the parenthesis as that is the way to retrieve a function pointer in you will also need to move the declaration of the function above the assignment of that function to the onsubmit event like this catch return if the function is not used elsewhere you can declare the function as an anonymous function like return seems a bit cleaner to

you are building an intranet application and are looking for sso then you can use something like which is based on	
you are going from bright colour to bright colour as the hex values then you may wish to interpolate in rather than rgb hsv space approximates how we think about colour saturation and rgb space approximates how the light sensitive cells in our eyes upper gradient is linear rgb interpolation from ff0000 to its middle value is a muddy middle gradient is a linear interpolation in hsv as both ff0000 and 00ff00 are fully saturated and have the same value the interpolation keeps the same brightness and saturation so the centre value is bright yellow third alternative would be a vector rotation in rgb which would mean the is b4 hex 180 dec 255 which is somewhere between the two this is done by calculating the magnitude of each end then scaling the result of the rgb linear interpolation so it is the same effectively sweeping the vector in an arc in the plane of the two colours and the as we actually weigh different colours equally for or see not but it does have a fairly even intensity across its whereas the hsv one is a bit lighter in the as got two values at where you have hsb support the algorithm is simple get the hsb of the end linear interpolate them as in the other rgb then convert create a colour with the color hsvinterpolate float color color c1 hsv0 new hsv1 new float alt hsv0 hsv1 float h mix hsv0 0 alt hsv1 0 float s mix hsv0 1 alt hsv1 1 float v mix hsv0 2 alt hsv1 2 return v believe has the conversions built so the code much use color vectorinterpolate float color color c1 float alt double x0 double y0 double z0 double x1 double y1 double z1 double mag0 double mag1 double x mix x0 alt double y mix y0 alt double z mix z0 alt double mag mix mag0 alt double scale mag return new color clamp x scale clamp y scale clamp z scale int clamp double value int x round value if x 255 return if x 0 return return probably want to find the intersection of the vector with the edge of the rgb cube rather than simply clamping but in this case it matter either

you have to make changes to the api which already has some probably the best route is to deprecate the old api calls and encourage use of the new the capability of the old api calls would probably break the functionality of old so that is probably going to cause some developers using your api to become somewhat your language provides ways to indicate that certain functionality has been it can serve as a indication for the users to stop using old api calls and transition to new calls in the javadoc can provide notes in the documentation that a feature has been or from java 5 the can be used to raise warnings on calls to deprecated apis it would probably be a good idea to provide some tips and hints on migrating from the old api to the new api to encourage people to use the new way of interacting with the having examples and sample code on what to do and what not to the users of the api would be able to write code according to the preferred going to be difficult to change a public but with some care taken in the transition from the old to i believe that it the amount of pain inflicted on the users of the api can be mitigated to a certain an article on and when to deprecate from which might provide some more information on when it would be appropriate to deprecate parts of thank you to david schmitt who added that the in is similar to the annotation in the edit was overwritten by my as we were both editing this answer at the same

you use a bug tracking include relevant ticket do not need to mention changed or your the source repository can figure that out by describing the changes also only makes sense if it is not obvious from the sure you have a good first because this frequently appears in the change history and people need to find things by this bug tracking ticket number should go for to commit related changes in a single changeset split unrelated changes into two even if to the same

you use instead of position absolute an empty space will stay in the page structure where the element should and this space will be the height of the element you could float chld1 and chld2 to get them side by add top bottom padding to push chld 3 down and use position relative to split them apart and move to any then use clear both on solid 30px 0 30px 0 solid to convince myself it really a	
you use show show you get a patch that includes the commit along with the and commit git show brian campbell thu mar 5 2009 update another yet no newline at end of utilities generally ignore extra stuff at the beginning of the so the entire output of this should be valid to use as a you can also use to get something that is formatted to be easier to automatically using for instance or htanata points what you see in the diff header itself for the individual file is the blob while you can use that to find revisions it could have come that will be slow and not necessarily if you need to refer to the better to leave the headers mentioning the commit with the	
you use static arrays you have access to the size of array using sizeof if put it into you can pass it to function by reference and passing argument by reference and by pointer is the same on assembly level almost sure of if you use dynamic you know the size of array at compile so you can store this value in but you will also store only a pointer to array in foo int int you can pass this structure by but what you realy do is passing pointer to int to and int of my opinion it help you the only thing that is in is that you store the size and the array in one place and it is easy to get the size of the if you will use a lot of dynamic arrays you can do it this but if you will use few easier will be not to use

you write a tcp you should also be writing a client unless you are doing something you can simply fire packets over the loopback adapter between your unit test and the stub you only need to verify that you are doing tcp properly with these as the rest of your tests in proper unit test stub over the logic and jump right in to the individual unit being all this is completely worth if you are new enough to tcp that you sure how and why you should unit test chances are make a few assumptions in how you write your tcp and unit tests will be invaluable for calling that you will also find it encourages you to focus on the needs which tends to result in a cleaner protocol and a cleaner server

your function really takes pointer to then you should pass since that will be a pointer to the obviously that will not simply solve your but you cannot directly convert an iterator to a since the memory at the address of the iterator will not directly address a valid can construct a new vector by calling the constructs a new vector by copying the elements between the two you would use it roughly like	
your image within a then either subclass that view and replace or set a delegate for it and implement the same method as a delegate this will give you the ability to respond to touch events beginning of a in this although you can do the same for ending a touch or moving of the this touch handling you can implement something similar to what i describe in order to perform a rotation of your uiimageview at a given to alter the change the duration property on the animation i as i suggest you may want to look into a cakeyframeanimation to do a smoother animation with acceleration and deceleration at the beginning and

your old codebase is next to perfection in both and which i make sure that before you start a new you fully understand it is you do not want to take the old otherwise you will repeat	
your operations are the same git checkout git reset git push origin they will have exactly that everybody else will get the branch named for and its ancestry up to the point where and first the old branch is then lying around in their repositories and will be garbage collected at some point in the future because nothing points to it is a branch that originated from the current of you will be fine otherwise you will get into the situation which can make a mess of your your you need to think carefully about what really trying to maybe a simple will serve you	
your own interface that provides the functionality you need and use that as the argument type for the cancelorder order public void or public string create a delegating implementation of that that calls down to the use a stub implementation in your i realize that you might need a richer model for the order this is just an do the same with the email service stuff by dependency injection through constructor or service

your server encounters an error in production it will show a default rails error page and not the stack trace that you see in development can add custom static html 500 or 404 error pages by putting them in and you would like to handle errors you can put the following code in your applicationcontroller code is but is based on a very similar method in one of my rescue exception handle the exception however you that the code above will not handle 404 you can specify a default action to handle routes that can not be located by putting the following at the bottom of doing a bit more there is an alternate and likely better way of custom error essentially the recommendation is to overwrite the method like def render
