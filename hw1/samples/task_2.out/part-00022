a database as several other posters have suggested will buy you certain things such as transaction security and the possibility of expanding what you store the you need just but maybe later store more and maybe more if your requirements are going to remain as simple as you then going to controversially suggest that using a sql database the simplest solution as i for certain a database does buy you certain very simple solution would be simply to have some directory in every time a client logs you create a file whose name encodes the information you want a hash of identifying and store extra info in the when the client logs you delete the issues need to be careful of include what happens when your app exits splitting among several directories if you have more a couple of thousand clients in particular seems to go ape if you have too many files in a even though principle you should be able to store as many as you and managing filing system virus checker is accessing a file just as you need to simple solution actually as bad as it the filing system is actually designed to access and index things just like a

a lot of places my workplace has legacy code floating around along with more modern for example we have a server application that still uses the microsoft fortran77 the less old parts of the application are written for the visual studio 6 c compiler and lately there have been runours of writing some new libraries with vs 2008 the have a number of different mechanisms to each other including static shared memory memory mapped name pipes and tcp to stop a application from being able to use any old library such as one of the fortran77 ones written in a procedural my application understood the file format of a fortan77 or c library and was able to locate the procedure call it wanted could it marshal the managed objects call the procedure and unmarshal the i copied a library file from linux to windows and my application understood the file format could it call functions from that think the answers are to do with the various c runtimes that are needed to initialise each if so then at a fundamental level are those runtimes the broadly similar to the clr they have different features such as memory management in the put my question another if an alien dropped in and gave me a binary library file and a file format specification could i use it from it theoretically possible to access any library from what does pinvoke do under the

a plaecbo effect splitting a developer between two projects in the manner described gives the impression that work is being completed on both projects the same whilst in reality probably a lot more since context switching and other considerations carries a cost time and one it can get the ball rolling on things like requirement clarifications and similar tasks the developer can switch to the alternate project when they are and it can also lead to early input from other business if you have one resource then you have a natural best thing you can do for that lone developer is to intercept from distracting that and try to carry some of the burdon around chasing clarifications and handling user feedback

accepted answer is a little you use the returned by that can be anywhere in your assuming you can see the variable which has pointer returned by is equally true of any memory allocated in c or whether stack or just put in front of a local and you now have the key that allows any other part of the program to get at the storage for that and use it just as effectively as if they could see the variable name variable names are only visible inside the scope they are declared but their storage is accessible from in any assuming the address has been taken and passed and yet frequently to take the address of local variables in and so it is unfortunately impossible to use those languages effectively without understanding	
accessing a smart card from through the windows certificate this works well on many on one system it the smart card certificate is not added to the personal need it to be in the certificate store in order to access it from like store new certs of the windows server 2003 r2 x64 used csp is identity client system is accessed through a citrix ica citrix presentation server the card through a diagnostic tool provided by the smart card reader omnikey the personal certificates in internet explorer 7 internet options content everything else we tried with the except personal certificates are not copied to the personal certificate store can be checked with guess is that forwarding the smart card through citrix works because we can access it in almost all but the csp do its work getting support for the csp is not easy hence this and what i find strange is that the certificate is accessible through which shows that they are available in some kind of windows ideas on where to look further are is there maybe a different way to access the smart card certificates like ie card client certificate get registered in personal store on win 2003 x64

also a big fan of using process of ruling out variables tremendously simplifies the debugging often the very first thing that should to be really effective technique is to roll back to your last working version if possible and try this can be extremely powerful because it gives you solid footing to proceed more a variation on this is to get the code to a point where it is with less than not working with more very important to not just try this increases your despair because it never rather make 50 runs to gather information about the bug rather take a wild swing and hope it

am by know means a hosting guru and i imagine there are ways and means of doing this but my personal opinion is that what you are talking about doing is defiantly an unnecessary security if this site is to be available on the internet it will have public access then you probably want to disable anonymous access in remember that the idea of being able to configure the anonymous access for a site in iis is so that you can create a user which has specific permission to read the relevant files for a particular what we are talking about here is file access on a physical for one thing a public web server should be in a dmz and not part of your companies domain so users should not be able to log in with their domain credentials only reason why i could imagine that you would want to switch off anonymous access and force users to input their windows credentials is for a site which will only be used internally and even then i would probably not choose to restrict access in this you want to restrict access to content on a public website then you would probably be better of writing something which handles authentication as part of the site itself or a service which the site can then if someone were to obtain user credentials then at least all they will be able to do is gain access to the site and there is no potential for a breach of your internal network by any is a reason why developers spend allot of time writing user management you will find plenty of advice on how to write something like this and plenty of libraries that will do most of the work for

an programming approach rather than a procedural programming approach in a program really depend on the language it php or but on the type of problem you are trying to just going to use pseudocode in my examples as i am not too familiar with if you have a program where you are just performing a bunch of functions in then procedural is going to be for if a simple string manipulation a procedural approach would if going to deal with many different items as or any other representation then an approach would be if you had a bunch of and wanted them to then in you may do something along the line in the can drive as each car is a different their behavior can be defined they may be both subclasses or they may have common really comes down to the type of problem which makes either procedural approach better than and vice from the issue of procedural or it may be a kind of to have one source file with many this can also be said about classes which contain many functionalities which may be better performed as separate functions in separate issue here may be of code organization rather than deciding to pick procedural or organizing functions into separate source files may be needed here than to abandon the procedural approach to writing the there are plenty of programs written in the procedural programming approach which is and easy to

answer is much more simpler than is you echo those vars running as because you already exit confusion by adding more debug for use a single echo that contains relevant to your problem process user export while sudo do sudo sudo this is key the exit commented out you get what you expect in the as the one the one running as never reaches that part of the code that exports sometimes running scripts in helps too

answer once accepted here is incorrect has since been so it does not correctly eliminate all trivially it may appear to work but it can especially in the case that 0 and 1 are considered valid for the following at and are perpendicular lines which clearly do not dot dot to the above these two line segments meet at an endpoint of 0 and that endpoint would apparently the two line segments meet at which is on line but not on line so what is going the answer is that the values of 0 and 1 are not valid and only sometimes happen to correctly predict endpoint when the extension of one line not the would meet the line the algorithm predicts an intersection of line but this is not i imagine that by testing starting with ab vs cd and then also testing with cd vs this problem would be only if both fall between 0 and 1 inclusively can they be said to recommend using the vector cross product method if you must predict

answer question 2 start or stop you just need to use the and the example code is right in the msdn question could have it poll a web service periodically if you want to do an you can set up the service for remoting and have it just listen on a tcp port for function then write a windows app that can use remoting to call the had to do this for a legitimate business app and it works very i would be very irresponsible if i include this setting up a computer so that it can execute arbitrary code is a idea and should be done very just because it be done mean it be if you go the web service how are you going to ensure that someone tamper with the web service and get malicious code to how do you know someone mess with your and point the app to their own web in the remoting how to you ensure that some other developer just create a proxy of their all amazed that microsoft even allows the to be used in a you can literally do anything you want with including launching the cmd shell and executing system urge you to seriously consider if this is truly necessary to you may be better served installing vnc or using remote or another app for remote other question you need to answer is the application be visible to the user on that remote if then you need to ensure that the service is set up to run under that you for launch word using the local system and it would never be visible to the person logged into that

appear to be using a rather narrow definition would i be right in presuming that you define encapsulation to data with wrong then please ignore the rest of this is not a loose in defined by the international organisation for the reference model of open distributed processing defines the following five any concrete or abstract thing of a model of an an object is characterised by its behaviour by its an a collection of actions with a set of constraints on when they may an abstraction of the behaviour of an object that consists of a subset of the interactions of that object together with a set of constraints on when they may the property that the information contained in an object is accessible only through interactions at the interfaces supported by the can further make a as some information is accessible via these some information must be hidden and inaccessible within the the property such information exhibits is called information which parnas defined by arguing that modules should be designed to hide both difficult decisions and decisions that are likely to see one of the great computing important to note that it is not only the data that is it is some subset of behaviour associated with the object that is difficult or likely to your you seem to be saying that the difference between encapsulation in oo and in functional programming stems from data but at least according to the iso and data management is not the key to so i see why encapsulation in functional programming need be any different from that in in your post that functional programming provides by the methods rather than the data i is a difference of scale rather than of if i use the rather please let me know if then you seem to find significance in encapsulation by object and functional encapsulation by by the iso definition an object is anything i wish to thus classes may be encapsulated within a so long as some of those classes contribute to the interface the public classes of the and some are private classes in the the same methods are encapsulated within a class some methods being public and some you can even take this a notch lower and say that mccabian sequential sequences of code are encapsulated within each forms a graph of nodes encapsulated within encapsulated and all these graphs form a graph thus functional programming may well encapsulated at the but this is no different from the graph of and essentially no difference from the graph of oo note that word parnas uses information hiding concerns potential such as the changing of difficult design decisions in the you ask where encapsulation is certainly a strength of but the question then does strength and the answer is one of resounding change encapsulation reduces the maximum potential burden of concept is useful itself is defined measure of the strength of association established by a connection from one module to in another of great as the paper in words never since connections between modules also minimizes the paths along which changes and errors propagate into other parts of the thus eliminating where changes in one part cause errors in necessitating additional changes giving rise to new defined there are two limitations which can easily be coupling does not measure and these connections can give rise to just as effects as connections paper does to relate but this is not defined in terms of connections between elements references to labels or with which coupling was the coupling of any computer program is a in that modules are connected there is little scope within the definition of coupling to manage the potential changes of which parnas these issues are to some with the concept of potential the maximum possible number of connections formable among all elements of a in for a class that is default within a package cannot have connections formed on it no outside classes can depend on reflection but a public class within a package can have dependencies on this public class would contribute to the potential coupling even if no other classes depend on it at the moment classes might depend on it in when the design see consider the principle of the principle of burden takes two strong form states that the burden of transforming a collection of entities is a function of the number of entities the weak form states that the maximum potential burden of transforming a collection of entities is a function of the maximum potential number of entities burden of creating or modifying any software system is a function of the number of classes created or modified we presuming an oo and are concerned with encapsulation at the we could equally have concerned ourselves with the level of functional that is modern software development is usually or or that depend on a modified class have a higher probability of being impacted than classes that do not depend on the modified maximum potential burden a modified class can impose is the impacting of all classes that depend on the dependencies on a modified class therefore reduces the probability that its update will impact other classes and so reduces the maximum potential burden that that class can is little more than a of the maximum potential number of dependencies between all classes in a system therefore reduces the probability that an impact to a particular class will cause updates to other and thus reduces the maximum potential burden of all by reducing the maximum potential number of dependencies between all therefore mitigates the weak form of the principle of this is all covered which attempts to mathematically prove such using potential coupling as the logical means of structuring a that when you encapsulation the key to all worthwhile the answer must surely there is no single key to all worthwhile encapsulation in certain merely a tool to help improve the quality of code so that it may also write encapsulation can be a barrier to flexible extension of an yes it most certainly it is indeed designed to be a barrier against extending the design decisions of an object that are difficult or likely to this is thought to be a bad an alternative approach would be to have all classes public and have a program express its maximum potential but then the weak form of the principle of burden states that updates will become increasingly these are the costs against which barriers to extension are to be you make the interesting comparison between encapsulation and and in your semantics are its greater no semanticist either even know such a word existed before the good mister ramsey alluded to it in his but i presume you in the sense or an interpretation of the of a and very basically that a class with method should be called a is great strength indeed in this is curious to me is that you pit semantics against encapsulation and look for a i doubt find my there are two forces that motivate the semantic and the encapsulation merely means encapsulation based on the meaning of the nodes use the general so if i tell you that i have two one and one called and then give you three classes cat and goat and ask into which packages these classes should be given no other you would be perfectly right to claim that the semantics of the system would suggest that the three classes be encapsulated within rather than other motivation for is and particularly the study of potential mentioned encapsulation theory actually provides equations for the number of packages that should be used to encapsulate a number of classes in order to minimise the potential encapsulation as a whole is the between this semantic and logical allow the potential coupling of my programs to rise above the minimum if this makes the program semantically easier to but enormous and wasteful levels of potential coupling will be a warning that my program needs to be no matter how semantically obvious it if the good mister ramsey is still could you or your semanticist friends give me a better word for phase using it would be good to use a more appropriate

are quite a bit of different arguments given i want to start by making clear that you cannot really make a each has its pros and and any code snippet will be more appropriate for one or the other that is as much to on the that you must know whether you have gc or not to write efficient argument is must know your environment and code that will make your code moving from one paradigm to the other and coding the same style will make your code more inefficient than what the gc really program makes thousands of heap memory allocations for short lived that it allocates and deallocates many with different size of a for each allocation you would end up calling and that requires locating in the list of free memory fragments the most suitable one to the specific malloc the memory is used and then it is freed with free in the cost of memory management is the cost of locating the a gc with a movable gc as java or after each gc run all free memory is the cost of acquiring memory for an object is really cheap cpu instructions in java at each gc only alive objects are located and moved to the beginning of the appropriate memory region it is a different region than the original the cost of memory management is primarily the cost of moving all reachable the premise is that most objects are shortlived so at the end the cost may be smaller than that of a one million objects allocated and freed on a single gc run amount to no extra in gc languages you can create all local objects on the they are on the other in a bunch of deallocations and new allocations is the memory is fragmented and the cost of malloc in systems you should use the stack as much as using the heap out of has another people used to one of the two memory systems will tend to write inefficient programs in the they are used to some idioms that are probably bad on the other clear example is a programmer that is used to allocate an object and reuse its internal pointers with new elements as is used to that way of allocation is reusing is if the same exact code is moved to a generational gc environment both are you get a funny in java generational gc the system will perform minor collections only on the younger only processing older generations in full but an object in the young generation could be referred to by objects in the older so extra work has to be performed to keep track of this in particular in garbage the system will mark the of where the old object resides and it then includes all the marked cards for processing during the minor effectively increasing the amount of work that the gc has to perform and possibly impacting object was alive during gc and it was moved that many times finally is moved to the old generation where it will not be moved in each gc run but can just stand but the programmer forces the object to become a it is moved once and it will again be moved each time the gc runs up to the time where it becomes old make a sensible you would need to get to programmers that know the environment write pieces of code that solve the same problem with the same algorithms with different mind sets about memory then compare the results of both of

are two dogmas to steer clear release until you are as soon as you have no matter how like the latter but it needs to be taken with a grain of common an overhead to any depending on your organization and certainly have to do preferably of the complete delivery opposed to unit testing do you integrate with other target a range of have complex large amounts of business you release a commercial product you certainly will have to have sort of documentation in place and but even software requires user documentation if of the for commercial software change management processes if you are lucky enough to have them for deployment require time and your end users will have to pay attention and possibly your people can get pretty tired of new features all the even if they acknowledge their for complex want to schedule end user training which are kinda expensive if done once every two get me releasing early and often has great particularly since we never get the business requirements quite but you need to weight those benefits against the real costs of a this is one of the reasons i like internal releases interspersed among the they have lower but keep you development process honestly the i guess i end up with the classic

can speak to this from recent painful this is a very old method that predates the metadata api on which both ant and eclipse in our only benefit is in defining your if using eclipse we and i you can define your project as being based on a particular as long as you remember to add new components to your your project hangs thing that baffled us for a are the many uses of noted the these come in managed and unmanaged flavors and are in the words of a recent post on the sfdc for isvs to deploy their stuff into various unknown orgs both managed and unmanaged packages have limitations that make them unsuitable and unneeded for deployment from development to production within an or in any case where doing custom development and intend to distribute code to a large anonymous this is what you see when you click in the web that we sometimes call seem to be just a convenient way to keep a project definition the conclusion coming toward is that our team not an does not need packages in any other forms of both eclipse and rely on the metadata in theory they are capable of exactly the same in reality they appear to be the migration built into the ide for makes deployment as easy as it can be is not and gives you a nice look at what it intends to on the other seen ant do some things the ide could so probably worthwhile to learn process leaning toward is to keep all our projects in and use the svn structure as the project definition will work with this and respect and we use eclipse and sometimes ant for no apparent need for packages the one more thing to be aware of not all components are some things must be reconfigured by hand in the target one example would be queues and groups also need to i likewise the metadata api directly process field deletions so if you deleted a field in your you need to delete it by hand in the there are other cases as useful steve

categories of uses for perfectly reasonable and downright helpful uses of for variable string of bytes you have in your generated embedded documentation see old source control history to the in practice you may have to include some ugly artifact in your code depending on some tool or some strange requirement which is helpful or needed for some but its not something you want to scroll over all the so you compromise by keeping it in your code but stashing it away so its not in your illegal uses of punishable by wtfs such and paste big chunks of heard of a malicious or code that lazy reviewers ask there are uses that depend on your such it to group members with related it to group types of class members is a but i believe that it is much more useful to group members by relationship or functionality rather than simply their grouping constructors may make sense because they all perform a similar function and may very well call each therefore it may be helpful to group them in a you could have several private methods that do all kinds of different some serving one set of some serving the just the fact that they are private methods does not imply that they are strongly related or that they should be maybe they could instead be grouped by what kinds of application specific functions they maybe some are dedicated to order submission and others are dedicated to data we naturally like to group things by but we have to remember that it is sometimes more helpful to group things by some functional relation as i this last group is largely up to and heavily depends on the type of application and also your forget there are other ways to organize your code such as partial classes or further refactoring of a class into multiple go use

completion it is a kernel object built into the windows os that is there to give you an intelligent way to manage multithreaded asynchronous very simplistic a little you tell the iocp about the io jobs you want it will perform them asynchronously and maintain a queue of the results of each of those your call to tell the iocp about the job returns immediately does not block while the io you are returned an object that is conceptually like the iasyncresult it lets you block if you choose or you can provide a or you can periodically poll to see if the job is doing those the iocp uses a thread the thread pool tries to limit the number of threads to the number of processors or less but the intent and the default is to limit it to the number of the iocp makes a provision for the fact that the tasks on these threads might asycn io tasks but you might have provided it some other kind of you can give the iocp another number this is a number of threads above the which the iocp is allowed to go up to due to one of the other threads being the goal is to have up to the of threads that are actually doing something not if this then for a while the iocp will be using more threads than the usual but it will refuse to make any new threads until it can get back down to the is a brief conceptual and as i in some but it should give you the general jeffrey books on the windows os cover this in detail these books are out of print you can find these books and they actually cost more used than they did i think is the title but there may have been an updated version of the book with a different	
conclussions below section for the sql application roles plays well with connection pooling and also be used directly in final user apps on a business sql alternative would take away a lot of advantages from using as it relies in you have a business do authorization at the application level instead of relying on sql if you still want to have an account associated to the business tier and associate a normal role to it is a client app that connects directly to the user will still have the permission to call whatever identity has access and the app password is if you are not comfortable with the user having that level of you need a business you still want to proceed with the turn off connection to reduce the open connections issue is it plays well with connection that is regardless of see at the end of in are 2 alternatives since sql server 2005 one is also mentioned in the thread you linked but it also points out it can go that its an unsecured option in a 2 tier like when the application used by the clients connects directly to in those cases the pwd for any application in the computer would be exposed in its more secure if it is a business tier the ones that but precisely the case where you really want connection another alternative mentioned in my second link to works well with connection it is based on stored and the execute as the execute as is called inside the and after the procedure is executed the context is that is great but really would be giving away a lot from what you get with linq2sql by going the sp

could use a hash function to find a item based on an but i see little practical use for this such as finger print face or object identification perform a feature extraction this means they convert the complex image structure into simpler feature vectors that can be compared against stored real hard work is the feature extraction process that must seperate the important information from the in the hashing the image will will yield no usable the only situation i would think about hashing a image to find some information is to build a image but even in this case a common hash function as sha1 or md5 will be of little because modifying a single pixel or metadata such as the author will change the hash and make it impossible to identify the two images based on a common hash

embedded it is often necessary to access fixed memory locations for peripheral the standard way i have found to do this is something like the access register which is located at address write to x read from understand how that but what i understand is how the space for is allocated what keeps the linker from putting another variable at can the space be reserved at the c or does there have to be a linker option that specifies that nothing should be located at using the gnu tools so am mostly interested in the specifics of that toolset at the additional information about my architecture to clarify the processor interfaces to an fpga via a set of registers mapped into the regular data space variables of the so i need to point to those registers and block off the associated address in the i have used a compiler that had an extension for locating variables from c i would group the registers into a then place the struct at the appropriate byte byte regs creating a struct reserves the space in the using the gnu i obviously have the using the pointer reg1 reg2 regs is a simple application with no os and no advanced memory address variable in

everyone else is correct about the performance of virtual methods and i think the real problem is whether the team knows about the definition of the virtual keyword in this what is the void b public void a new b new a2 new return surprising nothing is if the virtual keyword is added to the front of foo in both a and b we get this for the much what everyone you mentioned that there are bugs because someone forgot to add a virtual so consider this code the virtual keyword is added to but not b what is the output virtual void b public void a new b new a2 new return the same as if the virtual keyword is added to the reason is that the signature for matches exactly as and because foo is so is consider the case where foo is virtual and is what is the output in this the output virtual keyword works downwards in the not it never makes the base class methods the first time a virtual method is encountered in the hierarchy is when the polymorphism there a way for later classes to make previous classes have virtual forget that virtual methods mean that this class is giving future classes the ability to some of its if you have a rule to remove the virtual it may not have the intended virtual keyword in is a powerful you should make sure each member of the team really knows this concept so that it can be used as

exactly does not deleting in the context of an avl could mean you do work on which is to you update the tree at will cause the tree to rebalance because the upward scan for balance factors will be working with incorrect balance could mean updating the balance factors but not means you would end when you did decide to delete with balance factors greater than 2 or smaller than which implies multiple rotations to the problem here though is that you can no longer upon a whether or not eliminated a subtree because although you know there are say 3 subtree depths too many on one you no longer know exactly one element which is causing each level of that extra depth something you normally know because adding or removing single elements at a time so you have no idea how many rotations you need to you might do three rotations and only have lost one subtree because there were two elements at that in how would you even be able to which elements to rotate to get at the necessary they necessarily all exist in the path from your chosen delete element and the point where the balance factor is not but go out on a limb and say lazy deletes breaks avl as we know would you want to the whole point of avl is to amortize the rebalance cost across each so you stay at why build up rebalance debt for less frequent

far as i animation framework can be used for continuous but probably the best choice for i think it was more designed for transient like sliding a widget or i would look into either using opengl or possibly which allows you to do a more direct sort of if you look you should be able to find instructions for telling qt to use opengl or opengl es as the for the rendering which shoud reduce some of the hit to your processor you already done	
far as i can you are looking for the storage part of a data warehouse system here reports would be the the way commercial systems are doing is the cache you preaggregate your tables and create caches of the only way to accelerate your queries is to make the database system do less for this means less which in turn means less time spent in iterating the data or less data in the i would either propose the cache there really more than 24 you should be able to trivially parallelize the sorting queue by creating copies of the way to do would be to cache at hour granularity and then aggregate the hours into days 30 minutes if your timezones require this means you cache at a finer granularity than your daily cache but at a coarser granularity than the original

figured out what caused the problem but i still know why it happened when i started using and it must have something to do with how the linker decides to bring in and execute static libraries and my code under test is a static it refers to another static which at some point i know not decides to load in its is in the same directory as everything so i know why it find as far as i the code under test absolutely does not call the fmod initialization but maybe fmod has some static global initializers that initialize themselves and load in the and that code only gets pulled in if code in a module that uses it testing unmanaged code using the visual studio test framework and when i started using fmod it stopped every even tests that do would report for to get type the specified module could not be from a lot of trial and excluding files and i discovered that only one of the test files elicits the and it only does if this line is the tests start failing with that message if that line is in the is a function that does very instg new static does nothing beyond the default static void static return is a pretty vanilla class with no just various for its matter how i run the tests test run run run from the command from the test i get the to step into the test with the debugger fails the test fails before the debugger gets to step setting the debugger to break on system exceptions did nothing as code under test is a static clr support is and this just if i call a static entity member same if i move said static function outside of the same if i move that function to another i set the debugger to break on any i do get something exception at 0x7c812aeb in microsoft hrexception at memory location no source code at that of the call below may be incorrect no symbols loaded for the stack trace that mstest reports i get anything useful out of to get type the specified module could not be from at string evidence assembly boolean boolean at string evidence assembly boolean boolean at evidence boolean at evidence assemblyhashalgorithm boolean at at string at is fmod doing implementing fmod visual test strange behavior all tests fail unable to get if certain line of code in one

first interesting part would be to why do you an object changes its class at are various want it to respond differently to some methods for a given state of the might want it to have new functionality that the original class typed languages such as java and allow this to because the type of the object should be know at compile programming languages such as python and ruby may allow this i know for but i know they can add methods at runtime the first the answer given by charlie flowers is using the state patterns would allow a class behave differently but the object will have the same the second you would need to change the object type anyway and assign it to a new reference with the extra so you will need to create another distinct object and end up with two different

firstly worth clarifying do you mean in the classical comp sci data structures sense a linked or do you mean if you mean a an if you want to use an array just use the arraylist implementation and get behaviour and problem you mean an array vs a linked a slightly different argument for which we go back to big o is a english if this is an unfamiliar you choose whichever one best suits how you resize your if you insert and delete a lot then maybe a linked list is a better same goes for if random access is you mention serial if mainly doing serial access with very little modification then it probably matter which you lists have a slightly higher overhead like you dealing with potentially blocks of memory and pointers to the next probably not an important factor unless dealing with millions of entries

going to invent your own source control perhaps your own operating browser etc means if i ask you to write a small application which take about a be able to come back in about 10 years with an application run on any other machine operating be maintained by anyone else language that using a different source control system and different probably buggy are hard to for perform well you optimise than the well not have a good change log control is also hard to write well how confident are you that you can do a better job than the large teams of people thought about this long and and have proved their systems over you because the company will have gone bust long before you produce are times when worth reinventing some it sounds like you want to reinvent every wheel you ever come use the fact that millions of developer hours have gone into creating decent source control content management plugin scripting languages do you really think going to do a better job than those people save enough time by reinventing the wheel that end up coming out with a product faster than by reusing existing if just for fun a different matter but the fact that talking about a team that talking about a commercial anyone designing their own source control system part of the task of building a different is unlikely to be able to make a persuasive case for doing so with the possible exception of

good practice is to use 3 level revision is the is the are bug important thing is that two different software versions with the same x should have binary a software version with a y greater than but the same x may add but not remove this ensures portability within the same major and finally z should not change any functional behavior except for bug are some links to used	
good reason to upgrade is that old systems will become java for example is already at of service and while se for is basically the same but with paid a good idea to are few worse things than having a major security problem found in an unsupported product that you require and not having any update because newer versions seen a few companies pay major bucks to get support for some products after the end of life of those just because they have any upgrade strategy at	
good way to identify this issue if it comes up again is to click on the root add folder path to the shown then click the all descendants sort the files by and look for the unknown files and see if multiple files of the same name are checking out to the same usually this is the result of a mistaken or a change in folder it is undetermined what order starteam will check files having two different files with the same name pointing to the same local location is a the 2005r2 native windows client and cross platform client would pull files in a slightly different causing views with this issue to produce checkouts with different are a few ways to legitimately end up with this situation keeping multiple branches of a single file on the tip and designating which to use by view label is a common starteam is one of the few vcs that can handle multiple references like if you can help never delete and a of the it what you want to a file to the server gives it a whole new archive in the database and it will not be tied in any way to existing shares of that you will also lose all of your revision look for ways to move and if you have multiple files with the same name and content on your it is usually a good idea to make an effort to share the file to the various places it should exist rather than this will make sure your changes propagate so you need to fixes multiple

had to be there in at that there were a few commercial smalltalks but the biggest was visualworks from parcplace the marketers at parcplace were idiots choosing to optimize for max dollers per seat rather than max any shop wishing to adopt smalltalk had to pay a couple thousand dollars per developer for a any developer wishing to learn smalltalk either had to get hired to do smalltalk or sink serious cash into buying his own so it was just plain hard to get a chance to learn about that ibm was looking for a successor to cobol for their business they chose smalltalk and developed visualage and made it so the same program could run without modification on everything from mainframes to as400s to smalltalk has a friendly minimal syntax and is easy to learn so it seemed a natural replacement for the future looked really bright for the companies that were using it were everyone else by a sun showed up with they gave it away free instead of charging for ibm took a look at it and figured two first they want to enter a marketing war with sun that was clearly planning to spend a fortune on the java instead they decided to try to beat sun at their own game have the best java on the why they already had a great vm that ran on their whole stack they just adapted it to handle the java bytecode in all of java tools were actually written in smalltalk for several thus if one wants to blame anyone for the rise of java over smalltalk it is pretty easy to place the blame directly at the feet of ibm and their unwillingness to love i love coding in the being able to archive processes and restore them exactly later if they encounter the amazing the economy of expression and the brilliant class there is a new resurgence in smalltalk development thanks to pharo has some really beautiful ui the new cog seaside and these are all projects working on addressing the historical shortcomings of smalltalk including the poor os integration has a slick native widgets integration and have a new external code integration capability called and i mind that smalltalk that makes it a secret weapon for me and i am really encouraged to see all the new development smalltalk is growing and advancing again and this is good because a lot of the best ideas in software unit refactoring coding all were developed in smalltalk first and then filtered out to the rest of the world in diluted other limitation at the time for smalltalk was application packaging and the lack of dynamic loading large smalltalk applications had to rebuild the image file and redeploy for a java provided dynamic linking at runtime which provided many benefits to packaged by the time smalltalk added dynamic java had won mindshare at ibm so they stopped investing in time

have been your situation senior year of high school in an internship i c and shell programming mostly via copy and and later on at various times when i may have been in a similar situation with specific a class at your the one you want is the one that is the prerequisite for the advanced programming they probably also offer a never touched a computer level class but this one be the formal prereq for the follow on this will probably be in your way through one of the better programming books that includes kernighan and c programming language is a this would be my recommendation because c is similar enough to php to be but different enough that you will be able to keep them i say this even though you will probably never write a single line of production paul ansi common lisp is also a suitable you are really hard core and have the you can try structure and interpretation of computer by abelson and this is the book used in the first programming course at uc berkeley and at mit this may be too difficult to attempt outside a school designed for bright young students with nothing to do but study and with the regular opportunity to get tutoring from grad i include it only for would avoid any web programming you already know web i get the impression that you are feeling like you are hitting a bit of a and looking at a way around or over that rather than trying to go directly through would advise against looking into any web oriented book because it will not give you the big it will describe technique only as they apply to web the important things to understand are how a computer actually the difference between the stack and the the basics of garbage and probably be helpful to understand at least extension i if you understand shared libraries on or dlls on or classpath and jars on or how to create a library in perl or any one of those will be just the concept of loading outside code

have had recently two telephone interviews where been asked about the differences between an interface and an abstract i have explained every aspect of them i could think but it seems they are waiting for me to mention something and i know what it my experience i think the following is if i am missing a major point please let me single method declared in an interface will have to be implemented in the properties and methods can exist in a a class can implement multiple abstract methods have to be implemented by the an abstract class can have normal methods with abstract class can also have class variables beside properties and a class can only implement one abstract class only due of in all the interviewer came up with the question if you had an abstract class with only abstract how would that be different from an i know the answer but i think the inheritance as mentioned above another interviewer asked me what if you had a public variable inside the how would that be different than in abstract i insisted you have a public variable inside an i know what he wanted to hear but he satisfied to use an interface instead abstract class and vice abstract do you decide between using an abstract class and an vs abstract class

hit this issue about two years ago when i first implemented our swig as soon as we exposed a large amount of code we got to the point where swig would output files so large the compiler could not handle the only way i could get around the issue was to split up the interfaces into multiple modules and to compile them has several each module must know about dependencies in other i have a script to generate the interface files which handles this side of but it adds extra each additional module increases the time that the dynamic linker requires to load in the i have added an file that imports all the so that the fact that the code is split up is transparent to the but what is always visible is the long load currently reviewing our build scripts build process and i wanted to see if i could find a solution to this issue that was better than what i have have one shared library containing all the wrapper anyone know how i can acheive this with seen some custom code written in ruby for a specific where the output is to make this but when i looked at the feasibility for python wrappers it does not look so it possible to split a swig module for but rejoin it when

i always do with table design is look at it and work out what sort of trouble i can get into what inconsistencies can be your particular the obvious one is that you could create an address in the state of wyoming and in the city of which is in the state of i mean texas you could have an address that is in the country of australia the state of texas the the city of in peru in south i want to have to explain your schema to the postman when he tracks you do you resolve you should probably only reference the city from the then the state from the then the country from the addresses are a tricky beast and the form they take depends a great deal on where they are some have some cities cross state boundaries and so you have a dire need for finding people in specific just incorporate that into a address places have postcodes of some sort which is a better choice for you may well want to select by state or in which case leave those as separate first attempt would have would have to distinguish between states in different countries washington and western australia both being but you could easily show the country in data entry screens so that the operator knows which state entering more choose the country first and the choices of state will be whittled xolotllotl is not a real city as far as i just one i made up that sounds like those beautiful incan names of

i am using yet so i am trying to make simple what is too complex for me managing backing beans with conflicting navigation external params breaking rules and so for example when i need a backing bean used by other simply i call it using facescontext inside other backing but often too wired up to jsf rules to be really and of course more simple is more useful become the with only a bit of cross browser javascript a form copy and a on a i create a sort of proxy form inside the main user page disassociated from jsf navigation but using jsf ajax gives me flexibility on the user but data is always managed by i demand all user actions to an hidden which build up all needed forms according jsf then a javascript simply clone its form output and put it into the user view level for real command buttons and making the user plays around and when he click a script copies all form values into the real jsf form inside the that invokes the real submit of the what it returns is obviously dependent by your jsf is really a pleasure real interest is to know what are your alternative strategy for using pure ajax and jsf without adopting middle layer like ajax4jsf and all good choices but too much than and jsf using hidden iframe with what do you think about this development

i really like python is but come close to smalltalk in my but i am a biased some answers about which i guess runs on a squeak app runs in several different smalltalks squeak the term is not really used in smalltalk from what heard it would permit good compartmentalization of users as each would have their own little private vm independent of all the systems other users which sounds wonderful from a scaling and redundancy each user has its own wasession and all ui components the user sees are instances living on the server side in that so sharing of state between sessions is something you must do typically through a not done any smalltalk since uni 15 years back and i never dug too deep into it i see much entry level help for seaside or that many projects using is easy to get going with and there is a whole free online book on i suspect setting a server up to run it is hard for the same reason not because inherently hard but just cause there will be less help online and a presumption you are already rather au fait with not in quite tons of help seaside irc on is seaside as good as i think in terms of insulating users from each would say might i be better security sticking to the languages most familiar with so i make any n00b mistakes or will seaside be worth worth scaling the learning curve and prove more comprehensible and maintainable in the long killer argument in favor of seaside imho is the true component it really makes it wonderful for complex uis and if you are afraid of learning then you even consider it in the first place i then i would warn but if you are not afraid then you will probably love squeak is a truly awesome development environment debugging live seaside changing code in the debugger and resuming etc it

i was in i took several courses that encouraged the adoption and use of agile they were mostly a mess and although i learned a lot of from them they generally the things the professor was expecting us to i do agile development professionally now and love but here are the things i wish that i had known when i was doing agile in things squared with your schedule is really which makes daily standups more not if you sit in the same room then use twitter or yammer or just lot of benefit is simply in getting you into a that just mean weekly it means set commitment to and weekly this is tough to pull off in an academic context but should go a way towards helping you with your procrastination tough to get used to everyone has their own computer and style of try to hook a second up to your existing laptops if or use screen sharing and standardize on an pairing also really helps with procrastination but trying to do it without good tools is an awful lot of skimp on unit even if you think of it as a done projects before that i figured were too small to bother with testing and never failed to come back and bite me on the might be a bit believe it or we still do an awful lot of things on whiteboards or with index you may be your own customer but that mean you have stories estimable and helpful to be able to visualize these features are these are in these are ready for if like software recommendations i can give you those but i do recommend simple paper for a lot of the planning

important here is as soon the exception variable is no longer reachable out of it becomes eligible for memory	
important point that i think people here are missing is that with a database that supports parameterized there is no to worry the database engine combine the bound variables into the sql statement and then parse the whole the bound variables are kept separate and never parsed as a generic sql where the security and speed comes the database engine knows the placeholder contains data so it is never parsed as a full sql the speedup comes when you prepare a statement once and then execute it many the canonical example being inserting multiple records into the same in this the database engine needs to only one gotcha is with database abstraction they sometimes fake it by just inserting the bound variables into the sql statement with the proper that is better than doing it

is an interesting issue i noticed when using the have list of users from which i want to exclude some list of users is coming from an xml code goes like int id string name iuser public int public string public override string return id public static locallist new new new var matches from u in join lu in on equals select return static void xdocument doc users new id name a objects have not been var matches var excludes excludes should contain 6 users but here it contains 8 i call i get 2 matches as issue is that when i call the matching users are not being excluded at i am expecting 6 users ut contains all 8 users all doing in is taking the and just whose 2 iusers in this my understanding is that by default will use reference comparing the objects to be is this not how is even more interesting is that if i materialize the objects using and then get the matching and call works as users new id name materializing all objects by calling matches excludes excludes now contains 6 users as see why i should need to materialize objects for calling given that its defined on suggesstions insights would be much except operator and object	
is an interesting question about scaling in a serious are essentially do i establish n connections to an internet where n is only way to do this effectively and efficiently is to you cannot do this on a single so you will need to be able to fragment and partition your client base into a number of different so that each is only handling a idea would be for a single server to hold open as few connections as possible out the connectivity while holding enough connections to make whatever service hosting viable by keeping communication to a minimum this will mean that any two connections that are related as two accounts that talk to each other a will have to be on the same will need servers and network infrastructure that can handle you will need a subnet of ip each server will have to have stateless communication with the internet your router will not be doing any nat in order to not have to track will have to talk to there is no way that aol will be able to handle this level of connectivity without considering cutting your connection any service of this scale would have to be negotiated with aol so both you and they would be able to handle the are multiplexing technologies that you should kqueue and epoll come to order to write this massively concurrent and teleco grade i would recommend investigating erlang is designed for situations such as these telecommunications grade it is currently used for running ericsson telephone	
is an old article by but i was using nunitasp to write nunit tests for webcontrols in that article gives a detailed example of testing a simple control using their concept of creating a corresponding class that encapsulates the details of your control from you the tester can also be in the same assembly as your control so can share some things between them utility used the technique others use variants of the still today to test very sophisticated hope that is

is probably a dead post but add my two cents of the opinion that build numbers should mean something to everyone who sees so i personally think that this is a good way to name numbers are pretty but from the perspective of the 3rd it still needs to mean something to the released this new version to but it worth a new minor number since we just fixed some so incremented the patch 4th number usually means absolutely nothing to the so you might as well make it useful to you and anyone else in your company that sees so for that number is the svn revision it tells us exactly which revision was responsible for that version so that we can pull it out any any time to recreate branching code obviously achieves this but not to another advantage with an version number is that it easily integrates into nearly every continuous build my two

is really intended as a web server as a framework that fits into a web not as an email i suppose you could put some code into a django web application that starts up an email using the kind of code shown in that question you linked but i really recommend an abuse of the capabilities of dynamic web normal practice is to have separate email and web and for that you would want to look into something like sendmail or for pop3 you would also need something like dovecot or i certainly possible to have the email server notify your web application when emails are received so it can act on if what you want to in response to your yes you are trying to make at least an email an email server is just a program that receives emails may be capable of sending them as but you need could definitely write a small email server in python that just receives these emails and saves the images to the filesystem or a database or be worth asking a new but make it part of your django web keep it as its own separate

is the reason for requiring a test plan by links to a great of this issue which includes comments by michael schwern and ovid who are the and maintainers apparently this comes up every once in a while on the list and is a bit of a contentious here are the to not use a test annoying and takes not worth the time because test scripts die without the test harness noticing except in some rare can count tests as they you use a test plan and need to skip then you have the additional pain of needing a to use a test only takes a few seconds to if it takes your test logic is too there is an in the code your test will complete successfully without running the remaining test an observant human may notice the screen output look but in an automated test suite it could go developer might accidentally write test logic so that some tests never really have a progress bar without knowing ahead of time how many tests will be this is to do through introspection and have a method which should be called at the end of the test this is the approach i take fixes the problem where code has an in it fix the problem of logic which unintentionally skips tests its safer to use a but the chances of this actually saving the day are low unless your test suites are complicated they should not be using is a middle its probably not a huge deal whatever your this feature been useful to anyone in the real few people mention that this feature has been useful to them in the real this includes larry michael schwern the feature originates with more than 20 years other languages have this of the xunit type testing suites has the test plan i come across any examples of this feature being used in any other programming

it be relied but storing string constants in a pool is a pretty easy and effective just a matter of storing an alphabetical list of and then outputting them into the object file at the think of how many or constants are in an average code a compiler wanted to get extra it could suffixes can be represented by pointing to the last character of but that likely comes with very little benifit for a significant increase in i believe the standard says anything about where anything is stored this is going to be a very if you put two of those declarations in a separate then things will likely change too your compiler does significant linking

it possible to implement paging similar to ms word in a rich text editor using need to implement an editor using javascript that contains text in if i type text that exceeds the ficed limit of a page then automatically a new page is created and text overflows to the new page with formatting also if i copy large text from another source then it should calculate the number of pages depending on the text length and divide it into pages with all the formatting of the original need to break the text into lines based on pixel size using only html and i delete contents from inside a page then contents from the next page should be populated in the current page and if all the contents from a page is deleted then the page should be almost every paging feature in ms word should be implemented in this text with paging using

it possible to narrow the type of a field in a java class without making the containing class itself generic example would be something like class myclass myinterface extends myclass private t there any way to do the myconcreteclass private myclass myinterface is essentially equivalent to myconcreteclass or the raw myconcreteclass in my implementation the type parameter will vary over the lifetime of the object it is imposed upon me by and so the type annotation seems somewhat is an additional restriction i forgot to we will also have suba extends subb extends subc extends subsuba extends suba implements subsubb extends subb implements subsubc extends subc implements simply declaring an abstract subclass of myclass that implements myinterface is not a suitable the ultimate field type must be a concrete rather than simply an interface representing the for the simple reason that entites cannot be referenced by their interface that a persistent field in a jpa entity class must be of either a primitive type or a concrete entity a java field type without making the enclosing class

looking for some feedback on the advantages and disadvantages of the methods available for creating individual development branches in a perforce if i understand there are two ways of handling the first is to create a private which is a complete copy of the branch that you are working the branch would completely stand on its own and completely isolate your changes from the target other method that heard recommended is sparse it is described in this creates a but only with the files that you will need to you then overlap the target branch client view with this sparse dev branch client methods would require the programmer to perform some integration work in order to get their changes in the target the private branch method seems like it would require a lot more additional memory in order to create a copy of the whole the perforce documentation states that it performs a in this also enables perforce to perform a of the when you the server does not actually hold two copies of the files it merely holds the source file and a pointer in the database records the fact that the branch to the target file has lazy copies make branching a the server have to keep track of duplicate copies of makes it seem like the sparse branch method is just adding the possibility of human error to the process for the developer may start working on a file that they add to the sparse branch and then accidentally update a change to the target branch that breaks the the sparse branching functionality exists for a any feedback on why it exists and why i should be using it over a complete private branch vice would be greatly dev branches sparse branching private

me if i am wrong but tagged classes and are two different concepts though not necessarely mutally one has the urge of using tags in a class to define the type then one revise their class hiearchy as it is a clear sing of conceptual bleed where an abstract class needs to know the the implementation details that the class parenthood tries to are you using the correct pattern in other words are you trying to coerce behaviour in a pattern that does not naturally support it as is the ability to loosely define a type where a method can accept any types just so long as the necessary methods in the parameter instance are the method will then use the parameter and call the necessary methods without too much bother on the parenthood of the the smelly hint as charlie pointed the use of much like static or other smelly whenever they appear one must ask i doing the right thing here not that they are inhertitly wrong but they are oftenly used to hack through a bad or ill fitted oo

method i used on a fairly large form was to just reload the form with basically making a call back to the server and just returning the fields with their default this made is much easier than trying to grab each field with js and then setting it to default it also allowed to me to keep the default values in one on this there were also some different defaults depending on the settings for the account and therefore i have to worry about sending these to the only small issue i had to deal with were some suggest fields that required initialization after the ajax but not a big

my current mvc app found that enough to test the interaction between the repositories and the more than this is to iron out any wrinkles in the nhibernate everything exaggerating when i say above that layer is unit tested in i did have some integration tests from the controllers all the way down the stack to the database and these used an ioc container to build the controllers and the but i found these tests were really not adding anything and they were quite an overhead to so removed them from the tests for now i may find a reason to put them in but so far i the test process i use works like build process for the data access layer test assembly creates the test database via a fluentnhibernate configuration the build process then runs some nhibernate repository level code to populate reference tables in the integration test that runs is then wrapped in a statement and the transactionscope never has so each test can run in isolation and the results can be setup and verified within the scope by an isession without altering the state of any other test using var session this is an nhibernate isession setup any dependencies for the repository tests var testrepository new repository test code goes here the repository is using a different validate the results here directly with the at this point the transaction is rolled back and we changed the test means that i have to modify the unitofwork implementation using the transaction is rolled back at a higher

not technically an so maybe missing could someone spell out the tradeoffs of is it really faster to learn and understand jquery syntax than to just learn is more than another to it allows you to express yourself in ways that are more compact and succincter than the corresponding javascript at the same clearer and much more the benefits you get jquery is essentially a dsl for dom manipulation and this specificity is a major source of its utility and to a very large jquery is run even in this is still a surprisingly rare feat for gratifying and relieving to know that you have to waste time debugging obscure problems on ie6 most of the complete as a i prize apis and frameworks that have taken the time to spell out what all the moving pieces are supposed to be nothing is more encouraging than knowing that things are stable enough that writing documentation an attempt to hit a moving target and things are useful enough that attracted enough people to flesh out the documentation the difference between javascript and jquery is analogous to the difference between assembly and programming although both technically both interface to machine and can both do similar the latter is considered far more powerful because of how easy it is to represent things and develop

of good recommendations above that would work in most in my i ultimately wanted to load strings from a and keep the string resources as close to as i so i rolled my after looking at some of the implementations above for the resulting implementation was quite short and is a class which in my case derives from but it could derive from about any string there is also a class stringarg job is to take any parameter type and turn it into a string it mimics tostring in if a new object needs to be you just add another the constructor allows a format specifier for string class then accepts a string table id for the source a number of stringarg and finally an optional hinstance use lots of any of which could host the string so this allowed me to pass it or use a hinstance by to it it only takes a string id for an but it would be trivial to add an input string instead of a string s you are years old in for the stringarg class which does the equivalent of tostring on lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec cstring cstring hinstance dll implements this for getting own hinstance scenarios with a single resource dll need the string there are a bunch of member functions and constructors that take up to 10 these ultimately call centralformat which does the real string public hinstance hinst const hinstance hinst const const hinstance hinst const const const hinstance hinst const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst hinstance hinst const hinstance hinst const const hinstance hinst const const const hinstance hinst const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst const const const const const const const const const hinstance hinst void hinstance the implementation ok to post this much on although the bulk of it is very lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec lpcwstr formatspec return hinstance argscount below assumes a single character position cstring hinstance hold bool b string or more likely a bad stringid was used tell cstring could not be hinst ghcommonhinst was passed was not passed error inform for the degenerate lpcwstr pstr bool bskip this an incoming string only support 10 so the next char must be a closing bskip is a index positional cstring pstr past the two extra characters that we skipped ahead and peeked hinstance return const hinstance return const const hinstance return const const const hinstance return const const const const hinstance return const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const const hinstance return const const const const const const const const const hinstance return

of the base type of an enumeration has to be a numeric value so you have an enumeration with base type the following going to enum class1 intermediate class2 career development change it to use the default base type of something like the following will but change the names as you see fit might want to use the course name instead of the for remember also that you should use meaningful names whenever possible in an enum know you said you want specific code but i think this one illustrates my point much more clearly than any on the right track with the but you have to think of how to relate the enumeration to the array of string an enumeration is nothing more than a finite set of glorified with the above you have two values named and so in the you have to map each of these values to the string there are multiple ways to do but the simplest one would be a switch for return return however is to explicitly map the enum values to its base and use the base type to index into your for if you have the enum value1 value2 you can index directly into an array using this may be of use and is the

on the default custom action windows installer determines which files need to be before removing any existing versions of windows installer uses the value of the reinstallmode property to tell it how to make decisions about when to overwrite if reinstallmode contains an then it will only install files where the version is different or the file already files will only be installed if the modified date of the file is the created date the file is not if the reinstallmode contains an it will always install the regardless of any version or date information attached to existing is happening in your scenario is most likely the installer determines which files to it decides that some files need to be installed because they already exist and are of the same or newer versions as the ones in the previous version of software is including the files windows installer determined need to be installer installs files for the new but does not install files that it determined did not need to be end result is that a bunch of files are missing after upgrading the setting instead of omus will likely fix your but you should make sure you know how this affects the rest of your if there are any files that you want to be you will need to mark those components to

one i made just further thought may lead me to change the but even if the approach let me accomplish something i otherwise could not some i recently learned on a way to pass a value to a method such that the method would be able to determine both the and the for one common use is for parameter for void no string containing which is good because strings suck for the error message say something like parameter must not be the that explains why this works and points to the blog that is just using the same but in a different i am writing some unit and i want to dump certain property values out to the console so they show up in the unit test i got tired of writing property has the because i have to name the property as a string and then refer to so i made it where i could type lastmonthsinvoice get this tostring from where a fluent approach allowed me to do something i otherwise wanted to make take a params so it could dump such property values to the to do its signature would look like static void i could do lastname work due to type in other all of these expressions do not return the same lastmonthsinvoice is an firstname and lastname are they cannot be used in the same call to because t is not the same across all of is where the fluent approach came to the i made return the type it returned is something i can call this gives me this is a case where the fluent approach allowed something that otherwise would not have been at least not the full as i i wrote it probably see room for improvement or maybe even better i welcome static class code where idea came from static void expression value default of if var param throw new public static propertywriter var param return public static propertywriter propertywriter return public static void propertywriter class it is not even possible to instantiate this it exists solely for hanging extension methods private

packing is so perhaps your failure to understand it is because you imagine it is more complicated than it is either vertical a pile of or horizontal a queue of each element in that layout can expand or it can not for a horizontal layout with two which the code would since the default for packing is to have both those buttons added to the box will expand and they will each occupy half the no matter what the size of the container i think of this as widget widget if you want one of the buttons to not you will pack it like widget the button will only occupy the space it needs to draw text borders shadows images and the other button will expand to fill the remaining buttons need to be so a more situation is a textarea which you would want to expand to fill the other parameter that can be passed to is the fill and normally this can be it is enough here to say that if then the parameter is entirely ignored it make sense in that other thing you mentioned is i would generally say that this is not a good i say because there are situations where you will need to use but for someone beginning out with packing a user i would strongly recommend not using in let the boxes and other containers handle your layout for the does not do exactly what you would expect it to it does not change the size of a but merely how much space it will it may use and may even stretch to fill larger it will rarely become smaller than the but again because it is just a there is no guarantee theat the request will be

personal preference is to focus on making it visible that the type is for instance i would call it immutablelayer or if for some reason immutable is not a good word to prefix the name with i will add an attribute to the class indicating immutable is added in both has ups and the up is it gives a central place to check for just take a quick peek and the type and in there is no need to learn new method names or the downside to the approach is that you tell in certain type infererence scenarios that the value is for this code works just as well for an immutablecollection and a normal col i do not like to change method names to accomidate the reason being that it is a problem you will have to solve naming things should be but incredibly difficult some think of all of the types ever wanted to make imagine having to find new names or conventions for every mutating method on those a task and you will spend a lot of time educating users on those new dream scenario though is to find a way to increase the visiblity of immutable because the real problem not knowing the type is currently there is no good way to do this for all but hopeful for the next version of the languages

problem is that nsnumber objects are meaning that you cannot change their so in order to change a value you have to create a new nsnumber of course you have mynumber point to different object than the one you added to the so you have to update the array by replacing the changed nsnumber this leaves you with the problem that you have to store the index together with each nsnumber in order to be able to update the which is incovenient if you want to pass the nsnumber object around and allow changing the could solve this problem by introducing a wrapper object that you wrap around nsnumber in order to allow transparent updates or you just could create your own class that handles your doublevalue a mutable nsnumber

protect is definitely the better way to go what it is there i would strongly recommend you put all your users into and only ever use groups in your protections table much easier to can protect at any level of granularity you so is not note also that the server release has a new protect feature that allows you to specify what you can do in a slightly different change now allows specification of permission only allowed using permission levels which include the specified access and also of its lesser permissions permission rights make it possible to deny individual without having to lesser the new permission rights are and this functionality was previously and is now fully supported for you really have an issue with having to be an admin to lock unlock then you should take a look at the feature introduced in this will let a user to be able to add remove people from a so combine that with the protections get site admin to set up the protections and restrict rights to a group named and make you the group you can then add and remove users from that group to control trigger option is a but you still need to be an admin to set up the trigger in the first you could also affect performance of all which is something to look out but the main issue with triggers is that you would be using them to emulate a built in feature designed for that purpose protections if you wanted to be you would still need to find some way of preventing anyone else modifying the reference it just seems like a lot of work to emulate an existing

quote difference between and interpreters is that the latter restate language features in terms of the features instead of actually implementing in other hence the they depend on their host environment to give the features one of the key features of a language that allows interpreters to be written for them is that that the primary representation of the program is a primitive datastructure of the language lisp exhibits this by virtue of the fact that programs are themselves expressed as

reasons explain i would just treat the interesting event as being whether or not the or part of a has arrived to your a thread reading data from each as probably thread that does the message the client threads signal to the message collation thread the very first part of a new message when a message is complete from a client that it passes the actual message to the collation if your collation thread had the initial signal that the part of a message has just treat that as client ready to send a want to set a timeout on the sockets as another poster has although with this threading i think it really depends on what policy you want to other suggestion of asking the client is sort of but probably not the solution you really you open another channel to the client to ask you just sent some but if the client and you got then in general something has just gone wrong and not clear whether that knowledge will help you or it might say and then just at that moment send and will the other channel to the client if the client says sent how do you know whether just about to arrive or has and will never

refactoring the way the client code for a web service is the existing build creates the java client code by using a deployment of the web service on jboss and executing the axis 2 antcodegentask against this method fails if the development server is down or has outdated control fails whenever the wsdl need to build the client code against the web service class itself instead of having to point to a deployment of the web i use java2wsdl to generate wsdl from the web service class and then use the same antcodegentask to generate the client problem is that wsdl created by java2wsdl is different than what jboss displays in among other some of the namespaces are different and the antcodegentask step convert these namespaces into the correct package got to get the final package structure to be what the client code the existing antcodegentask uses to accomplish but when i execute the same antcodegentask to the wsdl generated by java2wsdl it convert the namespaces to the package would axis show different wsdl when the web service is deployed in jboss than it generates from there a way to use axis to create the client code from the web service class without generating the intermediate documentation for the java2wsdl and wsdl2java ant tasks is a little bit axis 2 v gives ant tasks for antcodegentask and 2 java2wsdltasks in different the axis 2 installation includes binaries for wsdl2java and but no codegen maybe antcodegentask is the same as anyone got something like this to work with axis 2 java2wsdl creates different wsdl than jboss shows in the	
reference is not a it may be implemented as a pointer in the but its core concept is not equivalent to a a reference should be looked at like it the object it is referring therefore you cannot change and it cannot be pointer is simply a variable that holds a memory pointer itself has a memory address of its and inside that memory address it holds another memory that it is said to point reference is not the it does not have an address of its and hence it cannot be changed to another think the faq on says it even though reference is often implemented an address in the underlying please do not think of reference as a funny looking to an a reference is it is not a pointer to nor a copy of the is the again in a once a reference bound to an it can not to another reference itself an object has no taking the address a reference gives you the address the the is its

should include the rating field directly in your posts it is a question of and you win nothing if you separate that value because there is no functional some rare situations you might add such fields as separate for example if you have to add the rating value to an existing table and you are unable to add a new column for whatever may be you can gain some performance if the rows are very large and change very infrequent while the rating value changes very i would not say that your case falls into neither so just keep it in the posts am going to summarize some common this if you have a set of possible rating such as and and all posts share this ratingvalue would be a string identifed by an the rating value is a simple just include it in the posts that is probably your include a integer rating value and not a string with a rating the difference is as the integer rating should be included because every value is a legal this is not true for the string they should be moved to a separate because only a limited set of strings represent legal you have multiple ratings per post the following is the way to go for a limited set of possible postid ratingid ratingid you have integer ratings you put them back into the post ratings you need to add an artifical primary key if you require one because there is no natural primary you associate a rating with a user and allow only one rating for a given post per user you get a natural primary key postid userid userid ratingvalue

simple and somewhat inaccurate way to do this would be to decrease the granularity of your it might not even be depending on how accurate your y measurements say we have the following y we floor the x and y we y 5 5 5 we can average those values by the floored x and y to show that we have average signal strength in the rectangle to the as as 1 as 1 as as table by ideally want to group data points by distance from point to and this groups them by a maximum distance that varies from 1 and to flooring them into rectangular so less than but it may work well enough for especially if the is less than the error in your measurement of is not granular you can use x someweight to adjust it to the granularity you and of course you can use or to do the same whole point is to a bunch of nearby measurements to one and then take the average of the collapsed

specific choice of threading model should be driven by the nature of the problem you are trying to there necessarily a single approach to designing the threading model for such an if we adopt the following arrive are independent and rely too heavily on shared is desirable to respond to an arriving message as quickly as want the app to scale well across processing architectures is the key design requirement more message at a faster to thread failure long operations is my the most effective threading architecture would be to employ a thread all messages arrive on a single multiple threads wait on the queue and process messages as they a thread pool implementation can model all three examples you single thread processes all messages thread pool with only one thread per n message types thread pool with n each thread peeks at the queue to find appropriate message multiple threads for all messages thread pool with multiple benefits of this design is that you can scale the number of threads in the thread in proportion to the processing environment or the message the number of threads can even scale at runtime to adapt to the realtime message load being are many good thread pooling libraries available for most including to your second whether to use standard windows message dispatch this mechanism comes with significant overhead and is really only intended for pumping messages through an windows ui unless this is the problem you are trying to i would advise against using it as a general message dispatching windows messages carry very little data it is not an each windows message has a and a this may not be enough to base a clean messaging model the windows message queue is not design to handle cases like queue thread or message these are cases that often arise in implementing a decent message queing

that there are two different performance and you stated which you are throughput and writing a gui the ui needs to be you care how many clicks per second you can but you do care about showing some response within a 10th of a second or so this is one of the reasons best to have a single thread devoted to handling the gui reasons have been mentioned in other the gui thread needs to basically convert windows messages into and let your worker queue handle the heavy once the worker is it notifies the gui which then updates the display to reflect any it does things like painting a but not rendering the data to be this gives the app a quick that is what most users want when they talk about they care if it takes 15 seconds to do something as long as when they click on a button or a it reacts other performance characteristic is this is the number of jobs you can process in a specific amount of usually this type of performance tuning is only needed on server type or other this measures how many webpages can be served up in an or how long it takes to render a for these sort of you want to have 1 active thread per fewer than and going to be wasting idle clock more than and the threads will be competing for cpu time and tripping over each take a look at the second graph in this article for the dealing note that the ideal thread count is higher than the number of available cpus due to things like blocking and the key is the number of

the varied responses will tell the line between interpreted and compiled is no longer as clear as it was when such terms were in also something of a mistake to consider as being either interpreted or as different of languages may do different these days you can find both and when looking at an things still there are layers of here are a few of the gradations between interpreted and pretty much what it says on the read a line of source and immediately do what it this actually done by many production languages pretty much just things like shell a trivial optimisation on the rather than interpret each line from first tokenised rather than seeing a string like 52 translated into a stream of tokens to avoid repeatedly performing that state of many versions of basic worked this this is the approach taken by languages like java and see the code is transformed into instructions for a these instructions are then this is also the approach taken by python at least the most common the and implementations also take this but compile to the bytecode for the java and virtual machines in time as but rather than interpreting the the code that would be performed is compiled from the bytecode at the point of and then in some this can actually outperform native as it is free to perform runtime analysis on the and can use specific features of the current processor static compilation may need to compile for a lowest common denominator later versions of and use this performs this for the code is compiled to the machine code of the target you may think now completely eliminated but even here there are some machine code instructions are not actually directly implemented in but are in fact implemented via even machine code is sometimes

thing i would do is check your employment you may not have touched the project from was a good move by the many employment contracts border on the draconian and they may own the rights to what you do in your free particularly in this case where what doing has commonality with your they may even argue that the backup solution is directly or indirectly a product of what you do for them so they have a claim to the rights a portion rights they do have and whether any employment contract terms are enforceable of contracts get pushed on employees that are basically is something you need to speak to a lawyer you want to take it that far get them to stipulate in written form email will that this was done in your own not as a product of your employment and that your demonstration is just any discussion about use of the product and licensing is deferred but you reserve the right to grant a license or you might not get all that but get as much of it as possible before the if there is someone sympathetic in management you can speak to just say that you touched this from work and just worried about maintaining control over your free time

think setting commits on a timed schedule is a particularly good especially if you start getting into testing and continuous committing at set intervals will break the build because there is no guarantee that you will have completed the changeset in the time better if you want to is to make the commit part of the build process just make the last step of the build process a commit to the that if the build you commit possible with all flavors of make and i know visual studio has pre and post build events that can be set to do something like so pretty sure that most modern ides can handle a special consideration for this problem in the commit hook to the beginning of the process so you can track when you mess up royally as well and how you come to fix the	
think that a good way to answer this question would to approach it from the other what practices make xslt and of the things that seen that result in ineffective of said saying it i find that is often a sign of the developer trying to employ traditional programming techniques in a declarative a lot of bad xslt seen exists purely because the developer understand axis and and so he implemented logic using xslt constructs you can sometimes eliminate an amount of xslt by providing your transform with for an xml document contains data that has to be parsed using xslt string often much simpler to do all of the parsing outside of xslt and either add the parsed results to the xml or pass the parsed results as an argument to the seen some remarkably unmaintainable xslt implementing business logic that would be trivial to implement in or biggest problem that running into in my own xslt world have several line transforms that is dead certain that there are templates in my transforms that will never be used because the conditions testing for will never arise no way to determine programmatically if something like is alive or because contingent on something that metadata tell

think you really should be looking at wcf for but for look at something like wscf services contract which defines the contracts in xml and generates a set of libraries reusable across you define a namespace and use that namespace in multiple the code generation then builds a shared library of types which get used across all the we use this extensively in our 2 solutions and we had to do some additional work around the code generation to get it to fit into our build but once that was done we never looked migrating to over so the wscf will become the link to the site for

third option is the best for any you will probably wish to add more fields to your person so the first option is it is very likely that you will have a large number of persons to and will want to look up records quickly thus dumping them into a simple array is done in option is not a good idea third pattern gives you the option to use any string as an have complex person structures and get and set person records in a constant definitely the way to thing that option lacks is a stable deterministic ordering is the upside of option if you need i would recommend keeping an ordered array of person ids as a separate structure for when you need to list persons in the advantage would be that you can keep multiple such for different orderings of the same data	
third party provided me a static lib to link with on solaris tried to compile with and failed at link suppose the issue is coming from the compiler i use or simply its version the std lib provided by the compiler could change from the version expected by the library afaik it could leads to errors at link could i know which compiler was used to generate this is there some tools doing some option in or an read some time ago that compilers use different mangling conventions when generating object files command line prints me well all function names from debug symbols in this static how does it work if my assumption is does have a way to resolve which convention is in use in a static or is it simply meaning that lib was generated by gnu as nm is a part of gnu binutils am not close to my workstation so i error output from the linker for the moment but i could copy them in a further there a way to know which compiler generated a static	
this a trick thing i notice is you are missing a echo should be echo see you fixed your post after i mentioned the above by adding the in your the function the and then the entire just exit the function as you may be so not much you can do with that other than echo anything here on down will not execute or if your function was more like return then you could do any of these

this is a specific sql server first off not sure if from does a full table the execution plan says that it that is true then you can lookup the number of rows in a table using the system tables and that will be faster especially on a large rowcnt from join sysobjects on indid know this relies on system tables that may but these for the last it also relies on your table having a primary so rather than storing the number of rows you have a fast but nasty

this is not difficult to achieve at all and its not a bad idea at it all depends on your project a lot of software products you not projects but depend upon this model so they dont have to rewrite their code ui logic for different client clients can customize their ui the way they want to using a designer form in the admin have used xml for preserving meta data for this sort of some of the attributes which i saved for every field for list multi check box yes then check if no then drop down show or not to on the web positioning i did not care much and simply generate table tr td tags 1 below the other however if you want to implement this as you can have 1 more attribute called cssclass where you can define ui specific properties and also note a lot of ecommerce products follow this kind of dynamic ui when you want to enter product information as their clients can be selling everything under the sun from furniture to sex toys so instead of rewriting their code for every different industry they simply let their clients enter meta data for product attributes via an admin form would also recommend you to look at it has its own pros and cons but i feel it can be used quite well with your

this kind of question i think you have to be very specific about what you are looking as there are many ways of interpreting it and many different some approaches are going to be too big a hammer if your question does not warrant the simplest there is the table data exactly the same or which you might attempt to answer with a simple count comparison before moving on to anything more the other end of the scale there is me the rows from each table for which there is not an equivalent row in the other or me where rows have the same identifying key but different data you actually want to sync table a with table b then that might be relatively using a merge

using the zend framework and the openid selector from however i find i login using sites like google and yahoo as they use direct identity based login system whereby one is just redirected to a url as opposed to entering a unique url of their own for checked out many options and hacks but none of them seem to how can i get this to work here btw how is it implemented at stack i could really use all the help here the issue here is that from what i have noticed is that the zend openid class support openid the thing is that a typical open id providor gives you a unique url such as or and the zend openid class just parses through that url and then redirects you to the providor website where upon authentication you are redirected the case of yahoo and google you enter a unique url instead you are redirected to the providors login site and upon login and authentication you are redirected back so basically whats happeining is that the object when it parses to tell who the providor is it fails to tell from the general url like when you click on teh google link it redirects you to more an issue with the zend openid object here and there any help on zend related forums so i was wondering if someone had already hacked or had an alteration i could make to the class to accomplish sorry if missing something but kinda new to this and programming with open id and have just started to get my feet for the follow up i did check into rpx a while back and they do have a php class but i wasnt able to check it out plus i really just want to for now get the code selector used as on stackoverflow to work with yahoo and google there has to be some kind of way to tweak the parsing which the zend openid class uses as it runs a series of regular expression checks to make a do i implement direct identity based openid authentication with zend

work for a software which has an in house predictive dialer and we need to implement a solution to obey to the i have a database with the customers that i need to and another database with the phone numbers i as the system is a predictive based on the performance of the time averages and dial more or less calls per logged system usually this number is around 3 4 calls per logged phone number repository for the predictive dialer is a postgresql the predictive dialer pick a bunch of numbers up from the database and send a command to the pbx to dial the and then the business logic goes on to transfer the valid calls to the call center and etc is irrelevant as my problem is before the need to implement the list this list will be provided to our company by a government in a csv on a daily every time i receive a new csv i have to purge the old and put the new one in first thought to implement it was do a batch the do not call list with my current customer but i think depending on the size of both the would be very performance and sometimes could not be finished had this kind of problems with batch processing and not a nice thing to second idea came up when i thought about how large institutions handle and authorization such as credit card or user i thought that creating an authentication service for the do not call list and changing the algorithm of my predictive dialer to check each number against this authorization service before dialing would be only confabulating i have no idea which idea is the or if i got it totally wrong and should look to another my question what would be your store the do not call csv file in use use do the batch processing or am i definitely know not the first person in the world to have this kind of so please enlighten is the right solution for a authorization

writing a very simple mailing system for a rails using restful a fairly conventional where sending the same email when a user signs up and when a user forgets their just having one problem that i seem to wrap my head like to use the same email template for both even though the email will come from a users controller and the email will come from a passwords email looks something like membership a user signs this works just causing an email that looks something your membership everything breaks when attempting to use this template to send a email from the passwords thing perplexing is that it only sort of your membership other is still as is but for some reason in this state come for the to be security really an issue in this and for that reason be nicer to be able to send a forgotten password in plain text rather than going through the resetting password but i do appreciate that this is usually not the user variable scope in

written a helper class that takes a string in the constructor and provides a lot of get properties to return various aspects of the currently the only way to set the line is through the constructor and once it is set it cannot be since this class only has one internal variable i was wondering if i should keep it this way or should i allow the string to be set as example code my help why stream new line responses line new if is a quick example of counting the number of valid responses in a given scanned would it be more advantageous to code it like this stream new line new responses if code is used in the back end of a web application and needs to be somewhat i am aware that this may be a case of premature optimization but coding this for responsiveness on the client side and i decided to include the constructor of the class as well this is what it really class private string public the date the exam was public datetime datetime test out return a value indicating whether to use raw public bool useraw get return true the raw points per public float float test out return 2 i included some sample properties of the class to help as you can the class takes a fixed string from a scanner and simply makes it easier to break apart the line into more useful the file is a line delimiated file from a scantron machine and the only way to parse it is a bunch of calls and new instance or just set internal	
written a library to match strings against a set of patterns and i can now easily embed lexical scanners into c know there are many well established tools available to create lexical scanners and to just name the first two that come to question is not about about the best approach to c the lexer example is just a concrete case of a general can see two possible a that converts a source file with the embedded lexer to a plain c file to a set of other files to be used in the a set of c to represent lexers in a more readable already done both but the question one would you consider a better practice according the following the lexer logic should be clear and easy to finding and fixing a bug should not be a in the build the preprocessor will require an additional step in the build the preprocessor will have to be in the path etc other if you had to maintain or write a piece of software that is using one of the two wich one will disappoint you an here is a lexer for the following all numbers be in decimal form including exponential like strings and single lists to lisp 4 on encountering the word end is or at the end of the the two scanner style 1 switch the preprocessor will handle this case skip strings case sum numbers sum case skip lists case stop processing t case skip a char and proceed scanner style 2 there can be up to 128 tokens per scanner with id x80 to xff is a pretty complex macro skip strings sum numbers sum skip lists stop processing skip a char and proceed anyone be interested in the current the code is macros or	
written a program to perform run length typical scenario if the text length encoding will make it was adding extra 1 for each non repeating since compressing bmp files with i went with an idea of placing a marker to signify the occurance of a repeating that image files have huge amount of repeating look the current example length is the but a noticable difference for bmp now my problem is in it so happens some bmp files have the pattern in the original so in the compressed file also contain the same however upon decoding treat it as a repeating i which repeats 9 so it produces wrong what i want to know is which symbol can i use to mark the start of a repeating character so that it conflict with the original

you already have to implement code to handle a layer on top of your my not store the actual not needed for you need the actual for each starting at output not output then encode both child nodes first then the same do if then read return new node around it with no bit was decode left and right the same and return new node around them with those but no is basically any node that have this you can calculate the exact size of your output before writing to figure out if the gains are enough to justify the this assumes you have a dictionary of pairs that contains the frequency of each where frequency is the actual number of for 10 each in freq calculation takes the leaf and nodes into and one less inline node than there are would be number of and those two would give you the number of bits total that my approach for the tree the encoded data will is a that would yield the from root down to that character in the a to do which assumes one character is just a simple bitwriter if read it back if return new node leftchild node rightchild return new example use node class public byte public node public node public node node value leftchild rightchild public boolean return leftchild a sample output from a specific character is just 8 so the size of the tree will be 10 5 1 49 tree could look like 12 c e b 6 5 1 the paths to each character is as follows is 1 is to calculate the output 6 occurances 2 bits 12 1 occurance 3 bits 3 6 occurances 2 bits 12 2 occurances 3 bits 6 5 occurances 2 bits 10 of encoded bytes is 43 that to the 49 bits from the and the output will be 92 or 12 compare that to the 20 8 bytes necessary to store the original 20 characters save 8 final including the tree to begin is as each character in the stream is encoded as 8 whereas 0 and 1 is just a single the space in the stream is just to separate the tree from the encoded data and does not take up any space in the final the concrete example you have in the you will get 3 2 b c d e 1 1 1 1 001a1b001c1d01e1f 59 000001100101110111 18 59 18 77 bits 10 the original was 7 characters of 8 bits you will have too much overhead of such small pieces of

you are using you are not i would strongly suggest migrating to it from its very easy to you can build a with all your udf methods and have the inherit from then in the onrequeststart method set a variable called the entiure you can then use to access the its very nice and simple way of handling if you like you can have all your cfcs inherit from the same basecomponent so that all your cfcs have those util functions as native makes unit testing cfcs very easy because the cfcs dont need to reply on a passed reference to the udf they are decedents of challenge with this approach is that the extends attribute of a cfc cannot be an so depending on how you package your this can be hard to the easiest way to handle it is with a coldfusion

you can do there are some have to use protocols that the standard libraries support many secure web service in pretty much stuck with using only basichttpbinding on the wcf service if you want to be consumed by a default install of that is a severe limitation in many enterprise it may be all you you need more security but are still using there are your wcf service must accommodate your but your client will also need to take advantage of an external need the service put out by keep in that these libraries implement a version of some soap while wcf successor to wse in many implements the standards by since there were some breaking changes in the protocols have to offer a endpoint on your wcf service to i tell you which as depend on which protocol you want to accommodate on the but most of your problems will be solved by changing the messageversion of the for the custom this is not the best but it could buy you something if trying to integrate a a lot of work to get a client to talk to a wcf service for anything other than in many basichttpbinding may be for many enterprise it will i speak as to which will help you or but it possible to get it to work done it a big look for an alternative if you

you have an existing object model and you are looking to migrate to an orm solution then i would say nhibernate would certainly be a good have to make additions changes to your domain model classes to support nhibernate goes a long way towards supporting persistence ignorance in your domain although you may find you need make some minor changes such as marking more methods properties as virtual than you otherwise would for mapping your existing object you can generate the schema for your this is a huge time saver for domain driven just this functionality is supported via the method with fluent nhibernate or via the hbm2ddl tool with standard nhibernate mapping this also of with maintainability changes to your object model can be quickly reflected in your database fluent nhibernate for mapping helps to make the initial mapping quite fast as you get autocomplete and a simplified mapping this will also help to give you the maintainability you are looking for your mapping is declared in code with fluent so refactoring tools will change your mapping you may also find that you can use fluent nhibernate automapping and avoid manually mapping your object model for the most entity framework for this will be more while entity framework is a capable orm in many it is not as mature as nhibernate and there are a few reasons in this case specifically why i think probably not the best will have to make a lot of changes to your existing object model to support entity if you want to use the currently supplied tools for entity framework you will probably need to migrate your code to generated partial classes which inherit from the entityobject entity framework base this inheritance requirement may or may not be a problem for you depending on your existing object you could avoid this by supporting in your code but this is and i think you will lose a lot of the built in tooling support for managing your will almost certainly need to manually create the database with a good sized object model this is typically not an insignificant entity framework does not support transparent lazy loading out of the sure transparent lazy loading is something you are used to with an and it is supported by most other nhibernate of but with entity framework you will find that you need to explicitly related objects parent and child before you reference them in your there are workarounds for this but not a in my for or where you are trying to leverage an existing object nhibernate is a better for the entity framework linq to sql or even become more viable may also want to evaluate commercial orm offerings such as i have little experience with this particular tool myself generally object to paying for an orm when there are good free but it is highly

you need to be clear what a service do you mean a single or multiple endpoints in the same you mean a single then but with a little an endpoint can only implement a single so what you need to do is combine all the interfaces you want to implement into a single interface imyinterface then implement them all inside your implementation what you cannot do is have multiple interfaces and multiple implementations magically merge into a single	
you need to group by first letter and sort by you are on a good way with your muenchian grouping approach would suggest an alternative a bit easier on the for the sake of legibility i left out the of the first the correct key would be this use a variable in a hence the literal alphabet same goes of course for the variable in the second but here you can in fact use variables since sorting is as you can use the same	
you need to send a custom search to the passing in the email address as the correspondent once got a logon can then do the i passed in a parameter to the search command to set the search axis as also specified a number of columns i want to get such as the case number the email address like to verify things like the ticket id the customer got as a response i sure whether this was what you wanted or the case the title and the date the case was opened you need to ever ask for the ixbug column as always available as an attribute of each case element returned in the but sometimes easier to have these things as an are lots of different search axis you can and many columns you can out the and the sample xml payloads at the botom of the

you own both codes the better approach will be to change unpack signature to pass the output buffer so it can be responsible for appending a you have control over unpack write a thin layer which will do the this you can only protect about a non null terminated but if you string can contains null characters this will not work as and passing the intput size output size will be the correct	
you perhaps treat it like a base 26 and then substitute letters for a base 26 in your right most digit will always be a raw number between 1 and and the remainder of the left is the number of so a would represent one lot of b would be an 2 column 26 2 column 26 2 column 26 1 column	
you possibly call the variable and document it it should take a file uri path or a i think good practice to call a variable it should be could possibly improve this by checking the input to the function as to what type it and whether it is if it matches neither of the supported argument types then you should throw an error for an illegal class declaration is fine missing an opening

you use a png8 with alpha images can have transparency in the caveats are that you can only have fully transparent or opaque images in between will just be rendered and that you use a large color palette or on your there is a possible workaround or you can use this in conjunction with the png8 option if your background is you can just match anything outside the corners with the using this you could easily make do with a single image for your corners if you make use of the markup would look similar to the the styles are generic and can be reused over multiple corner following would be used specifically for but you could reuse a different part of the same image for a different container or button are advantages and disadvantages to this it works with liquid and fixed and you can use it for menu items will work in ie6 for or it and using a css you can do it with a single even with multiple corner work with every borders can be tricky or it adds a few extra elements into the and if you use it for a link item with a hover ie6 has a hover flicker that can only be solved with a little bit of that javascript is only one line and can be included in a conditional

you want formatting c has more assignment operators than just and these are great for things like x most c provide a which looks like that does the same thing as x and is syntaxtic but sugar is at c and many other languages provide a special case for the operator from which gets its so x can be rewritten as with the same that there is a major difference between and but that matter for use whichever one you and make sure to put it on its own line all by itself until you learn the difference between and you find you have a variable using use instead of sizeofa argc printf sumofa argc printf sumofa printf sumofa you should not be blindly passing it your entire arguments only the argument you want to convert at this current but another and i suppose you change this seems like a battle for another why is this a community wiki i think your logic is off if you start at i think you want to stop 1 before the end of the but this is a simple error and you can fix that later when you know for sure that that in the i suggest you define a instead of the elements of the simply go through the add the numeric value of each one to an at the print out but maybe missing the point of the each time you iterate through the print out so you can see the value grow correctly each i think this is closer to what you actually want to do in the but i take time to check because i have a class to go

you want to break the usercontrol out of the something you can do to play around with the element placement in the z plane is to use a grid as the outermost container not doing so and use this as a guide to laying out your since items inside of a grid can occupy the same space and are based on the order in which you might be able to get the functionality looking sure if this fits what trying to but worth a items within a container are going to be clipped at the boundaries of their parent so to accomplish what looking for i would think the usercontrol would have to be a sibling of the stackpanel instead of being a child of

your developers discuss something passionate probably start by sending out an and having each developer send me back a list of three topics they want to talk about and share knowledge and it could be anything from techniques to tools to as long as they want to talk about it and have some passion about start picking and choosing which topics and which people are going to at the next be on the lookout for topics that multiple people because those may get some interesting conversations going if people have different opinions on the same what try and cultivate is a mindset of shared be looking for people who can explain to me what sort of obstacle they how they overcame that what they used to overcome and if they think those are going to be applicable to their development environment in the and hopefully they have some passion about their solutions and a willingness to share that also have them list two or three things that cause them in their what be looking for here is a chance to expose common problems and and then see if anyone has already had success dealing with the same or similar though knowledge their has to be an understanding of what this time is about and what everyone is there a like a support group for

your problem is dependency injection inversion of your goal should be to inject your implementation of instead of monkeypatching and this approach requires some changes to your existing design but for the right reasons your favorite design principle especially the same object should not be responsible for both creating and using other assume the way using looks somewhat like class otherclass public void someclass sc object o some more stuff what you should do is first create your class that implements the same interface or extends and then pass that instance to so your class becomes agnostic to implementation of in this case the code that calls is responsible for passing in the correct implementation whether be the actual or your monkeypatched class extends someclass public object your monkeypatched implementation goes class otherclass public void object o some more stuff
