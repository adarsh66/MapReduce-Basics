150k rows per the size of a these rows contain redundant data that you might be able to minimize by just keeping generall always a good thing to keep tables small so that index updates go through as mentioned by ben s above your queries should be optimized at least so that no access to columns with missing you can find some possible issues using explain and in the slow query log of your mysql server if got it thing that might help you with performance issues is the memcached using it you can delay writes to your thereby taking out some of the steam and still suffer from dirty caches and though depending on the application framework using any at it requires some work to implement this into your archiving and statistics purpose i suggest you take a look at infobright an open source mysql drop in replacement on designated purpose is to be a data warehouse you can use it for all sorts of data analysis got a very nice compression that in our case reduces of raw data to about compressed i guess needless to say that querying specific rows of compressed data be quite but for statistics pretty darn so if not querying specific rows but instead analyze things like many rows got updated with value foo bar between dec 08 and feb it will give you very good in as you use the db it will analyze your usage and create a knowledge grid that will optimize data for your specific next question that would come to my mind if data that keeping for a or some is a relational db the right tool for the knowing the exact nature of your application i could imagine some sort of sessions could reside in a terracotta cluster for that write a transaction log and commit their data every so often might be better but as i that depends heavily on your nature and the ammount of data in

a bit complicated to do but a new button to use as your input control have this as the visible this element needs to be a button or a link for it to be able to get tab focus suggest button so that it works better on the file input from the tabbing order by setting to it should now be hidden from sight and tabbing events to the file input so that on activity then the focus is moved back to the fake values are copied from and so a click event to the fake button that calls on the file input this will only work for it will also very likely break in a future mozilla style browsers you can move the focus from the fake button to the file input on the event will the occur on the file control and you can then move the focus back to fake button on this should also give you functionality the field in ie can only be done by rebuilding a new file input

a few your segfault is probably because passing a which is just a and then trying to it in problem that pointer does not live in it lives in you probably want to either the or use doing it this way will not edit can not just assign name to the if you do get unpredictable results and probably still in objects are locally scoped unless allocated on the in this in your want to do something new name 1 name in the want to do something my syntax may be completely and i realize the above code is inherently unsafe as not checking the to make sure not and not checking the return value of this should get you stand string literals are treated as constant storage and thus live on for the duration of the the i is when not dealing with string passing a pointer you need to allocate storage for it and you also need to appropriately when destroying said

a pair is tricky know whether it is or why not have a field of birthday in they were alive then or then you just need to do the search against this is a but stored in a type you can use that 1980 is a leap which is why i chose it otherwise those with a birthday of february 29th could be hard to a pair in the form of an give you a simple representation which would be easy to search and usually found that storing data in a single field is simpler than using two then never used had another a bit but even the birth in a format which is effectively i know if solr could easily do it in format and then do a lexicographic order but the alternative is assuming you need it to store birth dates earlier than sure you can tailor can still recover the original birth but the ordering will be in birthday with the oldest person first for any particular does mean hard to sort people by their actual i know if an issue for as i said a bit but it might help

a runtime environment as complex as the jvm is even excluding the jit and got a big memory layout and cache variation between thing that helps with jython is simply running the benchmark more than once in a single vm once to warm up the jit and one or more times you measure done a lot of jython and unfortunately it often takes attempts to achieve a reasonable can use some jvm flags to observe gc and jit behavior to get some idea how long the warmup period should though obviously you benchmark with the debugging flags turned for 1 2 3 4 you do all and use the hotspot server find jython slightly faster than cpython on but this is in no way representative of jython performance in the jython developers are paying much more attention to correctness than performance for the over the next year or so with a release performance will be more you can see a few of the pain points by looking at some derived from i

a small project i need to utilize a simple database with very light few no more than few thousands of records in 2 or 3 i am working in a database server those express seems like a huge overkill in this a very simple mdb database could do for most of the i am concerned about my idea is to place the file on a network share and let users access this file from their the db is mostly aimed at operations but users will occasionally need to records as if this will not be possible at the time to the db being locked or i can hold the updates on the client and process them at a later question itself goes along these are concurrent reads handled in are concurrent handled in there a concept of locks and how can i leverage it in a placing the mdb file on a network share good or horrible i am working in i would also love to know how can i detect any concurrency problems and take appropriate which exception should i catch and what action would you recommend to it may be my bad description of the but most answers seem to advise going for a full blown db i do understand the differences and benefits of having a server installation and have in fact implemented a fair number of projects on mssql and in this i am only concerned with access and its concurrency so please do not suggest a db for your access

afraid that because a browser feature to refresh the why you set the cron job to run more frequently that every 5 there is no other option then you could create own daemon to do the job more php script 60 two more variation of version of the script will remain resident for four and execute the code 4 times which would be equivalent to running every if this script is run by cron every 5 seems some confusion about what a cronjob and how it is is a which sits in the and run tasks through the shell at a schedule specified in user has a and there is a system crontab can specify jobs which are run as that run five minutes after every 0 run at on the first of every month output mailed to 14 1 run at 10 pm on annoy 22 mail are your echo 23 minutes after 4am 4 sun echo at 5 after 4 every to run every five echo will be run every five to run every echo will be run every output from the commands are emailed to the owner of the crontab as specified by means if you run something every minute it will email you every unless you ensure all normal output is suppressed or commands are run as the user who owns the which contrasts with the scripts run by the which are run as the user similar whatever the is configured to run can make life more complicated if the cronjob is writing to files which are supposed to be accessed by the scripts run by the basically you have to ensure that the permissions remain not sure that this is the system you are refering if you mean something else by then the above might not you want to do something that your current host is not letting you then rather than hacking around the you might what to look at switching hosting alternative is to put the script in normal scripts and have some external scheduler run wget against it at whatever frequency you alternative is updating of the form of however that may not solve your

always been interested in writing web software like forums or things which take a limited markup to rewrite into but noticed more and more that for try googling bbcode parser and test a few you either get an inefficient or you get poor code with xss holes here and my previously mentioned of the poor bbcode parsers out how would you avoid now take your typical regular expression for handling a and you can mention how vulnerable it is and how to avoid assume input has already been encoded by htmlspecialchars with image tags are hardly more secure than i have several specific mostly specific to php it better in this to only match using a validation is it better to use and a then ascertain whether or not the input is a valid as would be obvious the would work in the above url but would fail if the was about functions like within a would they be any deterrence or problem far as uri standards it be safer to write a is the time and processing power needed to develop and use such a thing too weighty for something handling several different entries per know my example is one of and is more specific than shirk from providing your looking for principles and best and general recommendations for in a and the on

am asking this question because i know there are a lot of cs types on here who can give a clear am wondering if such an ai exists is being that it writes programs by generating and compiling code all on own and then progresses by learning from former i am talking about working to make imagining something that learns what works and what in a programming languages by trial and know this sounds so asking to find out been if course even a human programmer needs inputs and so such an experiment has to have carefully defined like if the ai was going to explore different timing that aspect has to be clearly with a sophisticated learning ai be curious to see what it might know there are a lot of human qualities computers replicate like our tastes and but my imagination likes the idea of a program that spits out a web site after a day of thinking and lets me see what it came up and even still i would often expect it to be but maybe once a day i maybe give it feedback and help it avenue of this thought is it would be nice to give a description like or and it generates code with enough depth that would be useful as a code completion module for me to then code in the but i suppose that could be envisioned as a static hierarchical code completion about is there ai to write code by	
am attempting to create a reusable navigation style in like a navigation bar on a it will contain links to all the main pages in my this control can go on top of all my pages in my giving a nice consistent look and feel across like a issue is in styling the current link differently than the other so that you can quickly glance at it and see which page since the control is the same on each i need to tell it which page is and have it style that link first thought was to simply place properties on the one for each and then set the appropriate property to true on the i could use one property that accepts an enum value instead of having many either in the control template for my header custom i can create a datatrigger that watches this relativesource all that my this but going to have to duplicate that and all the setters in for every single page i because the trigger has to directly reference the property which only applies to the one so i need a different style for every even though the actual style its describing is exactly the same which i the setters are the the only difference is what property the trigger is there some way to do this something with the same end without ending up with hundreds of lines of duplicated style active

am calling devenv from nant and normally all is however we occasionally have the issue where a developer has added a new project and has checked in the solution file but forgotton to add the new project to source not sure but it this situation visual studio puts up a dialog with an ok button saying that it cannot find the project trouble this is on a headless build server that nobody is watching and the only thing we notice is that the build will would prefer it if devenv then exited with a nant could pick that up and would fail the build which is the correct there a way of stopping visual studio from doing or as an alternative are there any good validators avaiable i could run before launching devenv to check that there is a good chance that it fall over with a silly resaon why i am calling devenv is that i need to build deployment projects and the only way to do this to is to use turns out that my build script was explicitly calling that is the gui form of visual the resolution was to remove the part of the call leaving the command processing to favour the over the the version display the dialog it bombs out on the command line instead which is the behaviour i can i stop visual studio 2008 from displaying a dialog if projects are	
am confused about authentication with most of the few examples i have found for authentication and authorization in blazeds and consequently java servlets in general make use of http basic and digest authentication and realms for these examples are very simplistic and involve xml files with the user credentials rather than using a my past experience in web applications used form based logins and sessions for authentication and but i am not sure how to do this with flex apps with blazeds i want to do is have some way to access some service on the backend to handle authentication like an html form and some way to store session data in a cookie for but i am having trouble finding relevant details using cookies in blazeds and flex http authentication with either basic or digest authentication is the best then is there any resource to find out how to authentication users with the credentials stored in the database rather than an xml am not particularly interested in web frameworks since i would like to understand how to users with a plain servlet and

an answer because too much to say for a comment question author studio express is not offering all this tools as which i asked express provide that you reply was unit documenting if i am think that you get what you want with visual studio see my conclusions studio deployment projects are certainly missing from visual studio but frankly not much of an the whole feature is half good enough to tick off a feature good enough for toy deployments but my opinion not really up to the rigors of the real installer is an open source toolkit from microsoft not a for creating the installer for microsoft office 2007 was built with so reasonable to believe that it can handle any smaller installation tool is the scriptable install perhaps easier to understand than but also not using with the msi technology built into windows and therefore harder to manage in the enterprise microsoft testing framework is and while up to the not the leader of the in if you google around for reactions to find many who think it a ripoff of was a time that you could integrate any of the test tools into visual studio using though that no longer work is to use the external runner programs for your unit testing tool all of the major unit testing frameworks come with when using vs express i tend to have the test runner hanging around in the rerunning tests then just involves a task is the grandaddy of the testing and it works very there are others around such as and version of visual studio has a good story for in they all have the a compiler switch to generate xml files based on the documentation convert those xml files into real you need other used to be the but that project is unfortunately now dead a sad microsoft open source is likely to become the new gold but the tool yet as mature and easy to use as we would is a new release in this might be worth you can there are good ways to achieve the goals you even using visual studio in there are only two things gain from moving up to a paid version of visual get if you want be able install like and someone getting i think the value proposition is start with the free tools and spend money when you have enough experience to spend it

and but i must disagree with you in the strongest way possible in regard to not using pt sizes and always using designer wanting a font size to be to the default size specified in browser or os which should be the should use or a designer wanting an size should use to keep the font size constant regardless of the dpi and laptops and mobile screens have much denser pixels than up to approximately 150dpi of natural resolution compared to the medical and other specialized screens go even and the user has the ability not always the to raise or lower the logical dpi to customize the display according to his preferences and sight image or text sized in pixels will be too small to read on a making your users struggle and rendering any users with less than perfect sight unable to read the more importantly one can argue if this is correct behavior or some browsers do not resize text even when the user commands making the situation paper where position to the precision of 100ths of an inch is possible and everyone reading a work sees the the diversity of devices used to access the net invalidates the entire concept of which looks good only on the one device it was targeted the point of the design on the web is to make the site accessible to the target which usually should be as large as possible and would be using a range of devices and systems are already going there with vector ui elements at the large source bitmaps that are scaled so should forgetting about the arbitrary unit of measure called and making your designs compatible with the widest array of access devices to additional raised by the situation with dpi awareness thus with proper support for in currently popular operating systems for the lack of a stronger printable a as summarized by the most computers know so the browsers in the absence of this operating systems and browsers typically just make and these assumptions are usually while in theory points would be the best unit for fixed in practice using them today produces inconsistent results in many thus designers often have to give up and revert to pixels to achieve fixed font i use percentages and avoiding fixed sizes archives have a great of the font sizing and numerous links to details and various

are a couple of things going on java framework is offering you a nice way updated your ui but constrains you to using a specific the other hand you have a adequate model that represents your by using document directly in your model you also take the risks of tying your model to a specific which a good java document framework offers the ability to listen to changes you can leverage this into creating an between your model and basically when you setup the form you will make an instance of the adapter you will initialize with your the adapter will have a property returning a in addition the adapter will register itself as the listener for that document the adapter will be smart enough to know how to translate the chances to the document model to your something like is created along with the creation process it model from the create an instance of the it with your adapter also sets itself up listener of the the document to interaction with the document back to adapter notifies the the translated data view changes the view nofitifies the adapter model has adapter translates the into changes to the the adapter is tied to the java framework is should be pushed as close to the ui as it can likely the adapter will implement a interface exposed by the view so that the view have to reference anything specific to the framework you are when you change framework all you have to do is make a new object that implements that interface and the view is none the

are current for systematic build numbering and version number management in java to manage build numbers systematically in a distributed development to maintain version numbers in source available to the runtime to properly integrate with source to more automatically manage version numbers repository to integrate with continuous build are quite a number of tools and ant build system has a task that will maintain a build but not clear how to manage this with concurrent developers using or good and helpful partial or specific answers have appeared so summarize a few of it sounds to me like there is not really a strong on rather a collection of overlapping find my summaries and some resulting questions that folks might try to answer as to please provide comments if doing this you are using versioning of a specific checkout comes along for the build numbering can exploit this to create a unique build number that identifies the specific which we are using for legacy provide quite this level of manual intervention with tags gets you part way you are using maven as your build there is support for producing a version number from the as well as a release module for automatically producing use for a variety of but this helps those who to you are using as your build the following task description can help produce a java file capturing build which can then be folded into your build in a number of expanded on this idea to include thanks and maven hudson and cruise provide easy means for getting build numbers into a or into a is this enough to keep it from being tampered with intentionally or is it better to compile it into a class at build build numbering should be in a continuous integration system like to we have taken this but it does crack open the release engineering how does a release are there multiple buildnumbers in a is there a meaningful relationship between buildnumbers from differing what is the objective behind a build is it used for is it used primarily by developers to disambiguate between multiple builds during or more for qa to determine what build an if the goal is in theory this is what a release version number should provide why answer this as a part of your answers it will help illuminate the choices you have is there a place for build numbers in manual is this so problematic that everyone should be using a ci should build numbers be checked in to the if the goal is reliably and unambiguously identifying a particular how to cope with a variety of continuous or manual build systems that may should a build number be short and sweet monotonically increasing so that easy to stick into file names for easy to refer to in or should it be long and full of machine please provide details about how the assignment of build numbers fits into your larger automated release maven we know this is done and but not all of us have drunk the quite really like to flesh this out into a complete at least for the concrete example of our so someone could build a complete strategy based on this mark as anyone who can give a description for this particular case cvs tagging relevant ci config and release procedure that folds the build number into the release such that programmatically if you want to for another particular configuration link to the question from 23 oct accepted the answer because i think a reasonable while several of the other answers also include good if someone wants to take a crack at synthesizing some of these with consider accepting a different the only concern i have with is that it produce a reliably serialized build number it depends on a local clock at the system to provide unambiguous build which jul now include a class like the this allows the version numbers to be compiled into the final different forms of the version info are emitted in logging archived output and used to trace our analysis of output products to a specific final class svn should fill this out with the latest tag when checked private static final string private static final string 325 private static final pattern private static final string private static final string private static final string private static final string static matcher m if svn svn else if this necessary in this so but it is since we call it trunk in the real else public static string return answers a formatter string descriptor for the app version string public static string return svn public static string return public static string return public static string return public static string return public static final string stringbuilder sb new return comments if this deserves to become a wiki and version numbering for java projects

are experiencing an oracle deadlock deadlock detected while waiting for it has been suggested that the issue is with a process that is performing readonly operations using hibernate while another process is performing an update on the same readonly process in question is configured using hibernate and we have not explicitly defined a transaction for the while that may not be ideal i fail to see why hibernate would try to get an exclusive lock on a row when no operations were performed only a my question does when no explicit transaction management is try to get a lock on a row even if only a of an object is no is it possible that defining a transaction around the service that is loading and then specifically saying readonly on the transactionattributes would cause hibernate to ignore an already existing row lock and just load the data for readonly are some code loading the record we are using a class hibernatepurchaseorderdataservice extends hibernatedaosupport implements purchaseorderdataservice public purchaseorderdata return spring configuration for the service calling this method actual deadlock is occurring on one of the purchaseorderitem records being loaded by the call to the load the this cause a deadlock if the record being loaded was locked by another and if so would adding a transaction wrapper such as the one below solve the all methods require a transaction the database team has seen trace messages on the server that seem to indicate that our process is actually writing to the database there are logged commands that are performed on the exact columns we are reading from the it seems that hibernate is automatically writing these records back out to the database though we asking it that would probably explain why there is a this be because of a session flush or something looking more like the solution might be to use a transaction wrapper with readonly on deadlock when hibernate application loading data for readonly

are many more congestion control algorithms than you mention off the top of my head the list are also small variations of them due to bug fixes in actual implementations and guess that implementations in different oses also behave slightly different from one if i need to try to come up with an idea it would be to estimate the rtt of the you can try to look at the time it took between the third and the fourth as the first and second packets may be tainted by arps and other discovery algorithms along the you have an estimate for rtt you could try to refine it along the not exactly sure how you could do that but you require a full spec for the just ideas the rtt figured out you can try to put the packets into rtt bins and count the number of in flight data packets in each this way be able to of packets in to time and try some pattern matching alternative would be to go along the trace and try to in your head the different congestion control algorithms and see if the decision at any point matches with the decision you would have it will require some leniency and accuracy definitely sounds like an interesting and challenging

been working in tool support for traceability in software engineering on and off for the last fifteen and the best widely available is they all require manual connection to be made you can add ids to your code and unit and get some coverage metrics quite easy to make a simple tool which associates a specific test with a requirement and then reports that requirement as similarly you can add markers to say what parts of your code map to your design elements that has mostly been automated by reverse engineering then you can tell whether you have markers for all your requirements and all your design these are extensions to cots uml so probably not designed in quite the same spirit as no tool aware of currently gives you is any means to actually determining whether the tests exercise the parts of the design which are supposed to implement the hyperlinked requirement is as you can log the coverage in the code which is linked to the design elements when the test is are other such as cadiz and cog which are theorem proving tools which can take a formal description of your requirements and annotated model of your code and verify that the model matches the this works for sufficiently simple but is fairly time consuming the order of weeks for a few dozen lines of for level computer of the tools i know of integrate with

between single queries can happen as they lock single not the entire update query gets an update lock on a few rows in a and the select query gets a read lock on some other rows in the the update query then tries to get an update lock on the rows that are read and the select query tries to get a read lock on the rows that are update can get even more complicated with escalading the database decides that there are too many single rows locked by a transaction so that it should be escalated into locking a section of the table or the entire this means that the lock may affect rows that directly involved in the

bind your variables ocdecio not only does it prevent sql injection it is also much especially in a multi concurrency read for example variables are placeholders inside a sql when a database receives a sql it determines if the statement has already been executed and stored in if the statement does exist in oracle database can reuse it and skip the task of parsing and optimizing the bind variables makes the statement reusable with different input using bind variables also improves query performance in the eliminates the need for special handling of literal quotation marks in the and protects against sql injection

bit more detail might be you have your program you then create an event the function call to use is that event has two signalled and choose the state it starts you can now on that which is to you can for example give that event to an operating system function call and then wait on that when the operating system is it will change the state of the event to signalled and your function call will if only one this much use you could just call the operating system function and wait for it to but if you have multiple threads and you want to communicate between them you make function calls to other what you do instead is communicate with the other tell it to do something and give it the and then until program can have called a which is a thread which reading the programs message you can send a message to a thread and it will automatically be read by that so one use is if you have a number of threads is to issue a termination message time to another is to let the thread know you want it to do something and a message can take two integer values as so you can pass over the handle to an so the thread can signal you when its you could have it send you a message when its it all depends on how you want to organize your code event based or message

cursory examination of your code reveal any obvious though you seem to be using a lot of variables with global scope so always possible that got some conflicts that we one potential problem may be that reusing ids since you rely on the same variable to generate the ids for you could test this by having your textboxes named instead of than my recommendations would be to use firebug in firefox and set some breakpoints in the code to see what values are being beyond you might want to think about how you could simplify your code by refactoring to reusable functions for creating a creating a using parameters to provide the attribute since it appears you are using some sort of framework the is idiomatic of several you might also want to see if your framework has a way to handle creating dom elements in a more elegant

depends on the linker and how the library was usually libraries are a combination of object files libraries are a major exception to older linkers would pull things into the output file image at a granularity of the object files that were put into the so if function and function were both in the same object they would both be in the output file even if only one of the 2 functions were actually is a reason why often see projects with a policy of a single c function per source that way each function is packaged in its own object file and linkers have no problem pulling in only what is however that newer linkers newer microsoft have the ability to pull in only parts of object files that are so less of a need today to enforce a policy though there are reasonable arguments that that should be done anyway for

do you mean with something bad and then change their if implying that users can post for with their name and then change their name and the name attached to their posts change as then i think you need to reconsider your architecture and ensure that a username is a single point of reference and all representations of that username change when someone changes their sorry for but if the case that you have a single point of then changing your username is irrelevant to the say my username is foo and i troll some thread then change my name to as long as people can see what posted a post history then it matter whether i used to be called foo or bar is associated now with posts made before that were troll so perhaps you just need to create by making something like a post history overview on

done that back in 2000 my first windows program ever was a hook i did was implementing the filter hook driver and writing a userspace application that prepared a filter table on what to allow and what to when you get around your initial set of blue screens below for my debug tip in kernel the filter mode driver is quite easy to use it gives each packet to a function you wrote and depending on the return code drops it or lets it packets at that level are quite fragments are not reassembled and it looks more like the end of things no ethernet headers so have quite a bad time decoding the packets to filter with that also is the firewall hook as discussed in this you are on vista or server 2008 better have a look at wfp filtering that seems to be the mandated api of the day for writing know about it other than google turing it up some minutes ago when i googled for the filter hook forgot the debug dbgview shows dbgprint and more important it can also read them from the dump file your last blue screen so sprinkle your code with dbgprint and if it bluescreens just load the dump into dbgview to see what happened before it died very using this i managed without having a kernel

experienced when executing psexec against a remote but i always attributed it to the security context in which the remote process was running psexec you omit a username the process runs in the same account which you execute but the process is impersonating will not have access to resources on the remote you specify a username the process executes in the and will have access to network resources the account access note that the password transmitted in clear text to remote your executing a process that then needs to access the database then it could be failing trying to access the network depending on how psexec was if thats the imagine it would eventually time out and give some sort of resource unavailable are two things that generally done when executing deployment steps against a remote machine to prevent the behavior your rifferte make sure all assets needed are local to the psexec to execute the script that everything runs remote psexec domain it note that is passed in clear the remote

feel fortunate that i have been given an opportunity to improve code practices in my office by starting to implement some internal code reviews which could start out as some simple i need suggestions on tools and general went to school for softe and understand the process of classic software i then worked at a big company making operating systems where we spared no cost reviewing code and looking for i was on a very good team and used diff and participated in the mindset of scrutinizing code as a i work in a nearly opposite office that makes web pages and no one reviews we even have cvs setup it was one blue moon ago before i got we recently got hacked and defaced on one of our minor servers due to some insecure code that allowed unrestricted file because of my experience charged with coming up with the new review process which the boss likes because we can still bill for that time and he now sees that we need to do so i want to lose this opportunity because as much as i like the lack of structure we really could benefit from main question is what kind of tool would be good for putting up an internal review checklist for we could build our own but reusing a tool is obviously someone suggested i looked at it my main problem is web sites are not or even they could have problems in the even the js can reveal security and these things are all interconnected like a hard to break up and i see one monolithic security checklist cutting i have been breaking it up based on each piece that interacts with another and coming up with the short list for that such as when going from php into a remember to validate and escape from php to list sensitive details in hidden fields or functions on the client that kind of have to ultimately build something that integrates all the aspects of web for now focusing on security in the form of code i have to break it up by conceptual task because everyone will use it and some of us some just barely do some others are and we each have different things that need to be especially between sysadmins and php code review tool for web both for security and

for are pointers in disguise with some added syntactic pointers have any number of performance and efficiency aliasing is one notable the compiler guarantee that the memory underneath the pointer or reference is the same as the last time it read because any old pointer can go through and modify the compiler is forced to the value from memory on every use rather than caching it in most processors registers are memory accesses are so we never want to access memory if we can avoid primitive types often go into the compiler has complete control over what data resides in each register and can guarantee that nothing will overwrite the so variables of primitive types can potentially stay in registers for a long time until the compiler needs to write any changes back out to when dealing with primitive often less efficient to use a it disallows the compiler from caching the value in a inserts hidden and can open you up to performance issues arising from the efficiency important to you in this but you said you think of a good reason not to use the reference other than saving i submit there is a very good practice with this in in my would be to use references primarily for aggregate the compiler pass these around in a single register so the relative cost of using the reference is going to be heavily if the type in question is a primitive i would always prefer to work with a copy of the value rather than a

frequent uploads of small the fastest way would be to implement your own proprietary but that would require a considerable amount of work and also it would be meaning future integration would be difficult unless you are able to implement your protocol in any client if you choose to do it this is my suggestion for a simple 1 byte to identify be for upload 0x02 for download 0x11 for upload 0x12 for download can be or prefixed with a byte for the length the name is less than 255 md5 for instance upload request or download size upload request or download upload request or download could be implemented on top of a simple tcp you can also use avoiding the cost of establishing a connection but in this case you have to deal with retransmission deciding to implement your own take a look at http libraries like you could make your server use standard http commands like get for download and post for this would save a lot of work and be able to test the download with any web suggestion to improve performance is to use as the file repository not the but something like you can create a single table containing one char column for the file name and one blob column for the file since sqlite is lightweight and does an efficient most of the time avoid the disk access assuming you need client although is your preference to give you raw native code rarely this is the major bottleneck in this kind of most probably will be disk access and network mentioning this because in java probably be able to make a servlet to do exactly the same thing http get for download and post for with less than 100 lines of use derby instead of sqlite in this put that servlet in any container and

generally best practice to use named constants in place of magic but it sure is tedious and error prone keeping a database reference table and a file of named constants in is there some easy way to keep these two sources for this info in or am i overlooking an obvious design case my question an i have a reference table with 2 this table associates a usersstatusid 1 with the userstatus the user table relies on this table to normalize when querying for a status from i have two userstatusid from users where userstatus userstatusid from users where userstatus practice is to use the latter so the meaning of the number 1 is but this means i have to maintain a complete list of valid in my userstatus table and in my how do i avoid having to keep both the db reference table and my constants file using a centralized constants file so only 1 place i have to update for my but is there a way to avoid having to update a constants file at all when a new status in have one schedule a script to run once a day to populate a constants file via a query of the reference tables in the is this the best practice for keeping named constants in code and database reference tables in

have noticed that numerous on com point out that it is relatively easy to implement an object that can be used as an inner object in com unless i am missing it seems that aggregation can only be successful in extremely limited scenarios and thus support for it should only be provided when such a scenario is specifically part that troubles me is as com aggregation combines an inner identity with that of an outer the implementor of the outer object selects a subset of the inner interfaces and forwards requests for those interfaces to the inner the inner object forwards all requests for interfaces to the outer now suppose that the inner as part of its constructs child com presumably an interface pointer is passed to that com object so it can communicate with its the inner object has some idea of the interfaces that it however the outer object might have chosen not to forward some of those documentation states that an outer object should not blindly forward this seems to imply that the inner object often cannot hand away interface pointers to other com objects unless the outer object is specifically required to forward all of those interfaces to the inner this is not limited to a child object any place where the inner object implementation passes an interface pointer seem like they could be it appears that aggregation is not general purpose cases where the inner object must communicate with other com places strict requirements on the outer object as to which interfaces minimally must be forwarded and more interfaces cannot be added to this list in future versions of the inner object without breaking compatibility with existing outer objects that do not forward those this a correct seldom description of the way things actually are or is there more to the com aggregation not supportable by most

have several slave machines and a master machine which together run a distributed processes on each slave machine have to have a gui and network access think it would be called an interactive process for ease of use it would be nice if the master machine could the processes on those slave first idea was to use wmi and the class to start a remote process but upon further investigation it was reveiled that processes started this way are and and thus cannot have any a note says that one can use to create a remote interactive but it runs under the localsystem account which i would like to avoid i even get it to run would be good ways to solve this it is possible to launch a helper application which in turn starts a proper but that seems quite psexec was really clunky when i tried it and slow as hell sure looking further at psexec it seems it installs a temporary service on the remote machine to launch the would this be the only way to spawn an interactive process using a proper should i include a helper service in the setup for the but even how would i communicate with it remote processes in a windows

i have this word document that has a whole bunch of tables some of which are pretty it spans many many pages in some i need to programmatically convert this thing to was initially told we could just copy paste into excel and save it as a then i could convert from there which would be pretty due to the formatting of some of the fields there would need to be a lot of extra manipulation on the spreadsheet after copying to excel to get it to look right and to have the csv come out should note that this is an for an old app written in frowny debating just writing a separate command line tool in if make it seems like has some word interop stuff that i doubt was in the but i investigated that too just looking for the way this can be it matter so much how achieved as long as it is achieved and done some of the steps could be done manually if they too like if getting it to some other format first would save a bunch of coding and too difficult that would be anyone done anything like this any so here is an example of exactly what need to have a word doc that looks something like birds name data type required length total digits fraction digits text yes 16 unique observation primary the table with name and vendor and birds in this as an example it just has one valid can have multiple things separated by commas where each thing would be enclosed by value tags inside the what i basically need to do is get that to convert to this observation primary will always be a base table and a stage table where base table is the same name as whatever follows the colon at the beginning of the so it would be and the stage table is always then what follows the also notice the version and the last modified and version date in the these things can be worried about later and perhaps manually is the best way to programatically convert a word document with a table structure to

i kind of figured it out you do the division by by converting the bytes into a single number you will get using the smallest kind of byte which is 6 bits in knuths divide this by which is the value in location 1000 using the same quotient is the remainder the sign will be postive since both numbers are if you store 1644545 in ra and 65 in you will the smallest bytesize holds 64 since knuth never assumes a particular bytesize in his rx has a number of question the sign of rx is always the previous sign of i used the very handy utilty to play around with the registers of this is a pretty nice mix implementation done in

is a result of lacking parameter you can find yourself in situations these usually the one with the most parameters contains an implementation and the other overloads just call that one with default one thing to note is when number of parameters grows to number of overloads might grow to are so you have to treat them as they an object can only be constructed in ordinary you could call the implementation function as many times as you you have to call the implementation and that is also the thing to constructor chaining syntax points out these get back to the original even though these cases are not very you can overcome this issue by defining a new type using which will be used as the class public string p1 public int p2 public string p3 public double p4 public p1 p2 p3 p4 p2 we provided default parameters at the is this a solution for many will include optional and named parameters so we even need to define a new parameter you might think that feature as a syntactic sugar for however they we will this syntax for constructor

is in sqlite so been trying to see if there are any performance improvements gained by using sqlite disk based basically like to trade startup time and memory to get extremely rapid queries which do hit disk during the course of the the following benchmark gives me only a factor of in improved generating 1m rows of random data and loading it into both a disk and memory based version of the same i then run random queries on both returning sets of size approx i expected the memory based version to be considerably but as mentioned only getting experimented with several other sizes of dbs and query the advantage of seem to go up as the number of rows in the db not sure why the advantage is so though i had a few table used big enough to make a huge would make the advantage more is some kind of caching going on at the connection or os level such that the previous results are accessible corrupting the is some kind of hidden disk access going on that not seeing tried lsof but i did turn off the pragmas for i doing something wrong any thoughts on why producing nearly instant the to see whether offers significant performance numpy as c to avoid hitting trading safety for make a demo table if not exists demo id2 val index on demo index on demo for row in into demo start foo diff return build some fake data with 3 1000000 700 uniques in 1st 5000 uniques in 2nd load it into both dbs build execute a series of random queries and see how long it takes each of 300000 number of ids of each qq in qsize id1a uniqueness of ids id2a id1s for xx in id2s for xx in query from demo where id1 in and id2 in now look at the disk memory row in print the note that disk takes about as long as memory for a fairly wide range of query disk memory ram be almost instant relative to going wrong good suggestions guess the main takehome point for me is that probably no way to make but there is a way to make disk access other the benchmark is adequately measuring the realistic performance of but not the realistic performance of disk because the pragma is too big or because not doing mess around with those parameters and post my findings when i get a if there is anyone who thinks i can squeeze some more speed out of the db than by jacking up the and which i will all performance benchmark why is so as fast as

is the facilitator for operating on asynchronous once a async operation is it uses one of running threads to call you if no such thread exists it uses own internal thread to call of it as a queue containing it garantees you that those when will only do so on the threads that called its or or when dealing with sockets and async internal reason you must pass it to everyone is basically that someone has to wait for async operations to be an as stated in own documentation is link to the operating system service so it abstracts away the own async such as and the methods to operate on such as i end up using to demultiplex callbacks from several parts of the and make sure they operate on the same eliminating the need for explicit since the operations are it is a very powerful idiom for asynchronous can take a look at the to get a better feeling of why is needed and what it

it you specify how big how many programmers will how often do you plan to how we use trac on one big project spanning several years that consists of number of smaller are defined as points where we have some features in subproject ready for first milestone in each subproject is usually the we usually name milestones as name versions are just increments when we implement everything expected for subproject we mark last milestone as subsequent bug fixes go to milestone that we mark name description contains only list of new features or bug documentation is written in wiki and in usually have at least one page about new features that will be implemented in specific it is usually higher level description of expected behavior of there are examples of expected results application should contain detailed description of feature or bug that have to be reporting tickets contain description of bug and steps to reproduce tickets contain detailed description of feature that must be one ticket contains for up to 6 when we plan we divide features to be in range from 1 6 hours of if we estimate that feature needs more than we split it in several tickets so each of them can fit in hours of we picked 6 hours because we feel it is the top that we can estimate with error not bigger than that this 6 hours estimate almost always can be done in range between of there are exceptions from this in our main reason for wrong estimates is in bad specifications that we almost happens because we misunderstood business requirements of our are few trac plugins for estimating and time check this we use and estimation you can enter estimated time for ticket and time spent working on then you can get reports how much time you spent on and how much time you need to two we can pretty accurately estimate time needed to do some when we correctly understand users needs and we usually can deliver in promised our stats show that we overestimate time needed for tickets for about	
its main implementation compiles bytecode first and then runs it though of if you took a java source and the jvm compiled it before running you can run your application in you can run pretty much anything in	
its possible to get progress callbacks from the python module i would suggest finding out how many bytes are processed pr second by simply storing where in the file you where at start of the and where you are at the end when you have the data on how fast the computer your on you can off course save and use it as a basis for your next zip i normally collect about 5 samples before showing a time prognosses this method can give you minutes so as you get more samples you would need to average it this would esp be the case if your making a zip file that contains a lot of as zip tends to slow down when compressing many small files compared to 1 large

java language is what it you find much to change the core language without moving to a new language getting from management might not be as hard as you think to move to i was in a similar position as you a few years you can start introducing groovy into a few areas of your software that make great place to start is to start using it for unit essentially when you write a class in it compiles down to java as long as you have the groovy jars on your others may not even know it is groovy by using it for you can demonstrate how it simplifies your code and makes things you should be able to sell that to keep introducing it in other new areas where a dynamic language would save you some groovy and java mix very well together since they use the same set of core

may not directly answer your but i wanted to throw in what learned when using sprite sprite sheets are great because the fewer textures that the gpu has to switch between when drawing to the the better would recommend that you take a look at the sprite sheet if you it offers a couple great automatically packs your sprites different into one big i thought keeping my artwork in separate files and having the one giant sprite sheet generated automatically would be better than keeping all my art in one what if i decide i want my animations to have an extra frame in the then i have to shift around a bunch of stuff in the sprite sheet to make room for the new if using one file per just a one line change to the xml file listing what goes into the sprite sheet if i want to add a new frame in the can be a pain to list every frame file so i can see why this may not work for some but it was great for my i found that the gain of being able to swap textures in and out of my sprite sheet easily was more than worth which will help you as you determine what size of sprites to ran into a when scaling i believe that link describes the issue pretty in any this sprite sheet example will automatically add a 1 pixel border the color of the pixel that was originally on the around each sprite you add to the sprite which will protect you from seeing oddly colored borders around your sprites when because it still only draws the sprite using the original it just uses the extra border for interpolation instead of a nearby pixels or white is correct that there really any standard sprite size you should it depends mostly on what type of game you are what type of scaling and rotating you are there are specific sizes you need to watch for when using sprite sprite sheets are just one giant but there is a limit to how big of a texture can hold in their the xbox360 supports up to 4096x4096 if programming for then it depends on the graphics from what probably best to stick with 2048x2048 on because most graphics cards can support at least that last note on the sprite sheet i believe that it will watch for a maximum sprite sheet so if you do use you may want to add a couple lines to catch when the size of the generate texture is larger than you want to

maybe it would make sense put the code in but there a way to put a handler at which i can close database issue is that you can never rely on these events to because the runtime decides whether they are fired or because they might not even be necessary and can be skipped to save a cancels the whole processing of a request by using a and the lifecycle events after that will not be fired at why for example there is no or something would consider moving your logic to a different layer of and maybe initialize the database when actually requested from a then you can close the database file within the same method that you needed the this would make you much more independent of the state the is sure if this is the info you were looking for though	
me give you an example of the use of nested classes that might clarify when this kind of architecture is i recently needed to generate an html table by pulling selected columns from a data table and them so that rows become columns and vice in my there were two essential pivoting the data and generating some rather complex output was not just showing the each data row was subject to operations for extracting generating image setting up thus using a sql pivot really right an initial attempt to create one class to do the whole i recognized that much of the fell into three distinct header row and i decided that a better approach would be to encapsulate the logic for and into nested this allowed me to separate the data held by each row and program the pivot operations very cleanly a separate row object for each column in your data at the end of the pivot i generated output by calling the header object and then each row object in turn to generate its output back to the main classes appropriate because the nested classes did need some data from the master class and the processing was very specific and not useful just programming one big class was simply messier due to confusion surrounding terms such as and which differed depending on whether you were talking about data or html this was unusual work in that i was generating html in my business class so i wanted to pull apart the pure business logic from the ui in the nested classes provided the perfect of encapsulation and data	
me it seems boost has the most traction for new libraries and the fact that many of them got accepted into the upcoming standard speaks for use ace and boost myself and the reasons i chose them are that they are mature have a large strong user community which makes sure they will be maintained and enhanced and that i can get good quality professional we use for our support and are highly ace is a much older library than boost and one of goals is to support more exotic platforms it does not use so much bleeding edge technology as i am using a mixture of ace and boost and am very happy with that quite know why you put wxwidgets in the as it is mostly a graphics ui but if i had to do some ui projects i would go with mostly because this is also a widely used library of the kde desktop is built on top of and therefore well maintained and i would have access to a large user base for questions and

mention wanting this to work without a and without the polling the server for theory you can do this by storing the of chats in a text file on the and changing your page so that the user does a get request on the but the php page never actually finishes sending back to the the response never would need to send back some data to keep the connection going when there are no messages but in theory this would problem to accomplish the above is still a lot of you would need to do ajax posts back to the server to submit new the browser would be spinning the the whole time you nest the chat log in an iframe more and this kind of setup would just be very hard to suggest grabbing a free chat script from elsewhere or if you want to roll your own then go but start with a db and build a page that will push and pull messages from the if you are worried about the server with ajax just build the then if you find there are performance return to stackoverflow with a question on how to optimize it so that hundreds of requests are not flooding the chat when there is no

my current project a server product with no gui trying to write in better error handling errors currently are outputted to the logs and are typically not read by use postgresql as our database backend and we access it using direct jdbc calls and daos via a database most database related exceptions are wrapped in a generic class that implements and attempts to pull out debugging and state information from the exception it was in our particular it will access the underlying postgresql database driver so far this approach has worked well for getting more verbose information about what caused the database with the notable exception described since we have very specific performance and legacy support requirements we have a lot of custom sql that makes the following the stack trace back a bit more time intensive but not impossible or have noticed that when we get a as a result of a faulty sql the implementation does not return the sql statement that caused the after doing a little i found out that there is a way to drop the postgresql driver into a debug mode on startup and have it display properties about its internal it is undesirable for us to run the driver in debug mode in our production environment honestly i been able to figure out how to get it into the freakin anyone else dealt with this same issue before and found a if is there some oop pattern out there for storing query information before execution and then assigning that information to the exception or do most developers just feel that they need the full query to troubleshoot database i it because i have the full stack trace and i can look up the invoking but it definitely speeds up my debugging by having it be the first thing that i see in the error do i get at the sql statement that caused an sqlexception using the postgres jdbc driver in

my opinion better to create a file for every where the file is named after the i use a slightly different notation than chad namely a class autoloading is a nice but i use it very often under certain like where classes of the same type are added or removed object start creating classes for identify the actors in your a method of doing this is to write down what your application is supposed to then scan it for nouns and modelling your classes after because a class represents a single class namens are singular most of the if there are multiple you should name it objectcollection or something like this try want to create a little book library app to keep track of my book it should track the books i the the and the friends i lent them for every friend the phone number should be so i can call all the information is stored in a represents a book represents a collection of already covered by property of a you build the which objects contain other how does the relation between them look contains 1 or more books book belongs to exactly one book is written by 1 or more can lend a book to 0 or 1 friend and only to one friend at a friend has a phone will also tell you a thing or two about how your database should look everything is do you really need a phone number only a in this you should make it a additionally phone numbers are not really shared between friend objects would make sense if several friends living together having the same number and it often but for now that would be a bit if the noun can be represent by a scalar value and there are no other values connected to it may be overkill to make over time you extend your you decided to store not only the phone but also the address and phone number are quite similar types of so you add other variables for post code and so at a certain point get frustrated because the friend class grew with lots of and some of whom are prefixed to group them together and so so you might decide to relocate those to an own called address you leave the phone number to or just to keep the code clean wrong with but be about class hierarchy and object confuse they are entirely different a class hierarchy arises if similar classes share some properties but are different in so you create one class with the properties and methods they share and child classes which inherit the properties and methods of the parent and also add their own to handle the our library what could that to be i think of anything besides one thing thats a bit but go for it and authors are both both have phone numbers and an but they also because authors write books and friends authors normally borrow your so you might define the name and in the person but clearly belongs to friend while belongs to really make sense because never going to process authors and friends in the same but lets say you needed a list of all the adresses stored in your you could loop over your collection of persons and call to be even php is a bad example for because you can store whatever types you want together in an array and access them in every way you but in stronly typed languages not in java you have to define a datatype for an and possible to store different types if they have a common inheritance restricted to the methods the original class enough of that class inheritance object hierarchy simply states which objects should contain other a library contains book a book contains an author additional to be use names like name it because book objects is what you a good idea to name methods after the data type going to common if they return good naming conventions may be or as in or that are always the same for all objects of a certain class may be class lets if a person can be male or female and storing that as or in the it makes sense define the class constants and so you have and scattered in your all over the that only generate a single instance could be modelled as a good example for this may be the database class highly unlikley you ever need to open more than one transaction at read more about singletons at wikipedia but it may be a bit early for some people think singletons are a bad because more or less in once you implement them this so if you model your database class as a but later decide you need more than one database connection but you have a if you take the singletons may be

no good solution to this that aware the ide seems to require a configuration for each set of command line arguments to the so if n different sets of arguments are required as it sounds like the case is here n different configurations will be just how the ide it but one rarely wins in a fight against visual so i personally have always given in and created as many configurations as a and and yes the ide should ideally provide some better mechanism for managing the combinations but just and it actually take as long to set up as it feels like at the i understand can take some of the pain away by allowing easy sharing of configuration settings between so those miniscule text boxes in vs are only used to set up the settings that differ between this may make them still worth this something used myself only discovered it delete

not expensive to construct a data context regardless of how many tables it so that be a criterion when deciding whether to have one or more separate data context a new data context is until you actually start using and table instances are created as makes a data context instance expensive is when you use the same instance over and over again for tracking changes to different objects for using a cached instance of a data context in an application for all database operations a long as you use the data context as in a it matter how many tables it can manage at the class definition as you only instantiate the ones you need within the current unit of the data context logically represents the target so it should represent all the entities that are mapped within that whether there are 10 or 100 splitting it up really offers no benefit other than less lines of code in a given but if something you care about then by all have different

number of a series of a 32 bit unsigned int is 32 binary the string is a series of 5 digits can be stored in many as array elements and so the largest datatype in with complete precision is probably the decimal type just choose your own method of storing digits that allows you to store much bigger for the this will give you a sum of digits of is in 4875 sum of digits of is in 51 sum of digits of is in 2 algorithm and solution in as alluded to a number is nothing more than an array of this can be represented easily in two a an array of characters or others have storing the digits in reverse order is actually it makes the calculations much i tried both of the above i found strings and the character arithmetic irritating easier in the syntax is just plain annoying in first thing to note is that you can do this with one you need to allocate more storage at each as mentioned you can find a power of 2 by doubling the previous power of so you can find by doubling 1 one thousand the doubling can be done in place with the general digit in sum digit digit if sum 10 carry sum carry end digit algorithm is basically the same for using a string or an at the end you just add up the a naive implementation might add the results into a new array or string with each bad really slows it as it can be done in how large should the array well easy mathematically you can convert to where is a simple logarithmic conversion and the number of digits you need is the next higher integer from that power of for you can just required of 2 is a close approximation and you can really optimise this is by using larger a 32 bit signed int can store a number between 2 billion well 9 digits equals a billion so you can use a 32 bit int or as basically a base one billion you can work out how many ints you create that array and all the storage you need to run the entire algorithm 130ish with everything being done in follows fairly rough static void const int limit int ints limit number new for i i string text sum of digits of limit is static void int carry for i i if carry carry static string int i while 0 string ret while ret return

of the documentation for me clean up your code and explain it piece by do do puts array of symbols to strings by using you get this array of strings into any of the items which match the regexp will get fed to the block prints out the upcased string that it got block returns the upcased which grep then takes as the return value from grep is an array of all the gets assigned to it is because that was the only thing that matched the then gets doing a on an array just prints all the elements this very better off printing answer your question about how grep works behind the above documentation page shows the c source for grep it basically does a new ruby array to walk over each element in the passing some code is also used by and a bunch of other we know how all we need to do any more spelunking in the source we have our and your explain in more it does a new array to hold return the next item from the it matches the a block was call the and whatever the block put it in the return a block was not put the item in the return repeat until no more items in the to your comment of seems to make a lot more i idea is that the block does something with if it scanned the source and then passed the array of matches to the your block would then have to call which would be it would be less what happens for if your block calls or raises an in current you avoid having to scan the rest of the if it had already scanned the entire source list have wasted all this

of the optimizations you listed are practically irrelevant these days for c programmers the compiler is better at performing things like loop loop loop and strength versus for they generate identical machine so which one you use is a matter of in objects can overload those and postincrement in which case usually preferable to use a because a postincrement necessitates an extra object for using shifts instead of multiplications by powers of the compiler already does that for depending on the it can do even more clever such as turning a multiplication by 5 into a single instruction on with divisions and moduli by powers of you might need to pay a little more attention to get the optimal suppose you y and are signed the compiler turn that into a right shift because it will yield an erroneous result for negative so emits a right shift and some bit twiddling instructions to make sure the result is correct for both positive and negative if you know and are always then you should help the compiler out and make them unsigned integers the compiler can optimize it into a single right shift modulus operator works similarly if modding by a power of with signed integers the compiler has to emit an instruction plus a little more bit twiddling to make the result correct for positive and negative but it can emit a single instruction if dealing with unsigned

once heard a saying something like your class is getting too big and too then refactor it into a couple or a few smaller would strongly suggest you take something along this approach until you are more this will allow you to really get a feel for when functionality needs to be broken if you try to your project without any experience to guide then you are sure to make lots of i found that some people get so caught up in the principles and practices they start implementing designs that are very by speculative i mean that they might think later on we might want to add robust so they design everything to support the anticipated features list quickly grows and you will find yourself designing for all kinds of you will run into problems like do i get this particular class to both be compatible with my future authentication service and my future monitoring you will bang your head against the wall trying to solve problems which are not even relevant to your first you take my advice it is important that after you get a prototype up in that you then take a serious look at your now is the time that you can look at larger and ask yourself if they make one test is to imagine how easy it would be to explain the usage of the class to someone if it is complex or then a redesign may be in if they are too big and serving more than one then breaking it apart is probably important thing to remember about design practices is that certain techniques should only be applied where try to force your application into a certain architecture or design if it fit you will learn these things with experience and the best thing you can do is spend too much time over thinking if you dive right you will find plenty of opportunities to reflect on your you obviously have the right mindset already of trying to do things the which is just over do are lots of and out

only recently started with but basically interested in these i write any code if i learn i use windows mostly at work and linux at most of my friends use windows either predominantly or i know people with i would like the option of writing code for all of after trying a number of operating systems and operating system formed the opinion that the free stuff is of a higher also i find it more morally so i want to be restricted my library to writing proprietary after trying a number of operating systems and operating system formed the opinion that a real quality product forms more readily with strong commercial red novell and canonical make flavours of linux that appeal strongly to me and what do you commercial windows and mac os x are commercial operating and good enough for most this only serves to emphasize my simple build i come from a scripting and accustomed to having my changes applied the moment i hit save in a text editor not having to so having a very quick and simple build process is important to if i can use the same build procedure on multiple platforms by flicking a switch on a i feel like strayed too far from the scripting other look at me i know all the silly compsci 102 the first language i was really comfortable with is php is quite the powerful object oriented but most of the examples most of the completely ignores any object oriented believe me when i all the facilities for that kind of programming exist in php just that unless taught it you will learn all the things first like i i want to be able to participate in and i mind having to work to figure out how to apply it in if i get to choose which paradigm i subscribe even does qt stack easier to learn than pure you need to learn both to use it i had to do platform detection even i will have to when i finish my current project because there will be an option to wake up the display and linux test on a when certain events occur in the but arguably pretty low you can write a text web browser or game without needing a feature like my qmake project files are portable to all platforms without special software without requiring cygwin or although if i wanted to switch to msvc there would be no qt allows me to release my work under the gnu gpl if i and this makes me qt is backed by everyone knows i own a fairly expensive nokia with a bunch of qt apps on furthermore other companies like red hat et al submit the odd patch now and you get much more commercial than qmake how hard is it works on it works on it even works on i have to define anything or rewrite any project files or idiotproof and it never goes although i break free of object oriented programming when i use i can stray pretty far from it before the application falls and when i oop in qt is always waiting with open arms to welcome me i mind having to use objects of various kinds for no matter what mood in it feels pretty natural under as a never tried another library and i probably never i can get everything i need from qt at this even json and soap and file locking and quite capable of writing c code and i like plain c a looking into learning about doing not because of any dissatisfaction with after a bit of soul searching qt seemed like the obvious choice chose the not the language and then started writing it in its native i want to learn gtk because so many free software projects interested in use and interested in having the knowledge to contribute to some very interesting projects include browsers and instant messengers networking code is something pretty well familiar with of php even if it is in totally the wrong language so when some protocol problem happens in a software product i know what it is gone way off track now retaining the the point is that qt has everything i was looking for in a including portability and a shallow learning performance as good as doing native api function calls apparently but i still very quick compared to most scripting languages is more than fast enough if you write good code and even sometimes if you and still faster than many programming rather finish the application in one year and have it take an hour to than take ten years to write the same program to do that same job in 45 minutes the slower version is a stepping but bear in mind comparing the abstracted model to the bare api more information about how using a library can make an application more stable and more fun to look for me personally the questions is not switch to but move away from and there is absolutely no reason to do so at hooked for only be working with other systems if i happen to be hacking someone not used mfc i possibly tell you that moving to qt is the right thing to but i tell try see whether difficult to learn to use see if it hurts your work in any if you i bet you would win

quite are not so any answer will only be applicable for the particular problem that is being in my here is a list of general xml and protocol design whenever possible because of reliability especially with they are not universal most firewalls will allow port but you can run into blocked ports for a schema with a namespace that has a version or date in for that conveys information about when the schema was revised and also indicates a version which is useful for your feed is publicly consider implementing various rdf tags for your your data will then become part of the semantic your content supports use rss or because there are tons of clients out there that understand those formats so it dramatically increases your	
quite know why you want to just commit all snapshots i a shell script to do is probably less than 5 lines of code and less than 10 minutes of there is which would allow you to cut that down to maybe 3 lines and 5 but you still have to load every dir if you are so there is the tool which is intended to make writing repository converters and importers according to the you could write an importer in about 100 lines and a couple of all this ignores the biggest the of a vcs lies in the you could just as well use regular backups for but in the commit and no magic tool is going to help you have to type them all in yourself and more have to remember exactly you made every single little change over the last

really need to see the whole class to provide a difinitive but i would write a method to handle removing multiple objects from the dataprovider and perhaps assigning a new array as the dataprovider for the list instead of toying with binding and using the same list for the like i this is probably and would require a look at the context of the but that is what i would do 9unless you have a big need for binding in this returns a new array with the selected objects removed function var for in object return

reason that you simply use a grid or dock panel with the textblocks in to control the alignment is because the default template of expander left aligns the header content instead of allowing it to are two ways around you can either specify a width for the content of the header or you can define a new template for the second option is probably the but it is also the harder one to if you have expression blend then you can right click the expander element in the and tree and select control parts edit a once you have done that you will need to modify the template as well can select this time though instead of creating a once your in there you can pretty much just set it to for horizontal alignment and add a bit of margin to the right and your you have expression blend update the question to specify that and i will post some sample the main reason i done that here is that the template is about 250 lines of code and i want to generate alot of noise for no the reply that you gave i am guessing you have if you put the following xaml into xaml pad you should see an example of an expander which will enable the header content to span the full width of the you will most likely want to move the resources for the page into a seperate resource dictionary so you can reuse it throught the l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l as an alternative you could use a dock as shown by the following some	
reason this particular exception gets thrown is that the content of the element gets applied to the items so the xaml initialises the listview with a single in its items but when using an itemscontrol you must use either the items property or the itemssource you use both at the same hence when the itemssource attribute gets processed an exception is can find out which property the content of an element will get applied to by looking for the contentpropertyattribute on the in this case higher in the class on the intention here was that the view be set to a so the fix is to explicitly indicate the property to be the xaml and the exception goes was missing that

reason you probably want to do that is because these calculations are sql server is usually licensed by the cpu socket for for so dbas are very sensitive to any applications that want to burn a lot of cpu power on the sql server if you started doing statistics calculations and suddenly the server needs another an expensive licensing it makes sense to do these statistical calculations on a separate application query the data over the wire to your app do the and then send the results back via an update statement or stored more but as your application you be facing an expensive licensing	
reasonable implementer would just use a bitmap internally in the and draw to that using os native drawing does it not at all related to if what for the html parser sees a canvas element a given width it needs to allocate an onscreen pixmap to cover that it either does this manually or it calls into some os native drawing api to create a surface to draw the os native api could be or any other drawing library that the implementer of the browser highly dependent on the operating internet explorer probably calls into some windows native library directx or the drawing surface is made accessible to the internal guts of the javascript likely via a pointer or handle to the constructed drawing when the js interpreter sees an invocation of one of the canvas it turns this into a call to the appropriate os native using the windows style using a manually managed height it matter to the javascript developer how these methods are the only people who need to care are the ones who are writing html5 compliant web browsers with canvas

recommend using a separate presentation model type in most aside from the issue of binding is but there are other ways around this i think that there are other reasons why using presentation model types is a good models allow create a view and a presentation model at the same get your user representative to give you feedback on the iterate until both solve the problem of mapping this back to the models remove dependencies that the model might allowing easier unit testing of models will have the same as the view so you have to write code in the view to deal with navigating into and the models be used in an action for an object graph which contains cycles cannot be serialized to	
relatively new to java programming 2 but not to web i started out with html and asp and have recently started messing with i feel like i have a good grasp of find them to be similar to and have recently begun working with jsf and although i can see why people would like i find it to be a huge burden and actually slowing my development times i imagine this is due to the learning but i often find myself thinking that i would be finished with a if i were just using this common to those of you who have taken the time to learn a have you ever invested time into learning a framework and once you were proficient in just decided to go back to a method that as sophisticated but you felt comfortable also questioning whether chosen the right i was really hoping to find something that interfere with adding ajax java web frameworks really worth the	
relies on the fact that a hash is a one way in other its very easy to convert a password into a but very difficult to do the when a user registers you convert their chosen password into a hash and store at a later point they login using their password and you convert the password to its hash and compares it this is to a high level of probablity if then is a solution to a related if you know that someones passwordhash say then you can try calcuolating hashes for all possible sooner or later you may find that so you know their this takes a very long but the process can be speeded up by using for a given hash you can look up the corresponding however means that the text that is hashed isnt a simple english or a simple for the case i gave the text that would be hashed is not but is this means that any readily available dictionary is since the likelyhood of it containing the hash for that text is a lot less than the likelihood of it containing the hash for this likelihood becomes even lower if the salt is a random alphanumeric

second answer about using an they are very efficient and simple to implement even in software and are guaranteed not to repeat in uses for an lfsr with an are some drawbacks by observing a small number of outputs from the one can reconstruct the lfsr and predict all values it will making them not usable for cryptography and anywhere were a good rng is the second problem is that either the all zero word or the all one terms of word is invalid depending on the lfsr the third issue which is relevant to your question is that the maximum number generated by the lfsr is always a power of 2 1 power of 2 first drawback might not be an issue depending on your from the example you it seems that you are not expecting zero to be among the the second issue does not seem relevant to your maximum value thus problem can solved by reusing the lfsr until you get a number within your an you want to have numbers between 1 and 10 in your you would use a lfsr which has a range a pseudo code as to how to get number in the range x should embed the previous code in your so that the caller care about that this would slow down your rng if you use a large and the maximum number you want is not a power of 2

seem to have recieved a lot of answers for your first but at a casual glance none for your when should i not use the inherited keyword in overridden the answer is when you dont wish the inherited method to be careful though as not allowing an inherited method to run may break functionality of an inherited object in a undesirable way so make sure you are not introducing any unintended side an imagine you wish to fully override an inherited function called applydiscount but someone has hardcoded the discount percentage into the ancestor if you call the inherited applydiscount it will override your code or calculate a value you will then in this case you could just not call inherited and apply the discount is a contrived example so if someone can think of a better one please add

seems that many people read about distributed version control and implicitly understand why it is a good thing for open source with many distributed developers all acting independently and in accordance with their own choices instead of mandate from but from this impression many people form the idea that dvcs is useful in an they see how it would help an organization that releases a proprietary product and make its version control system accesible or how it would help a single are some benefits a business can see if it chooses to use distributed version control such as or mercurial instead of centralized version control such as cvs or should a business use distributed version

should avoid all optimizations if the only belief that the code you are optimizing will be the only code you should optimize is when you know it is slow through a you write easy to understand code then odds are be fast and if it then when you go to speed it up it should be easier to being common sense should apply should you read a file over and over again or should you cache the probably cache the so from a high level architecture point of view you should be thinking of part of optimization is the that are committed in the name of making something faster those sins generally result in the code being very hard to i am not sure this is one of but look at question this may or may not be an example of optimization be the way the person thought to do but there are more obvious ways to solve the problem than what was thing you can which i recently did is when you are writing the code and you need to decide how to do something write it both ways and run it through a then pick the clearest way to code it unless there is a large difference in on what you are that way you are not guessing at what is and you can document why you did it that way so that someone change it case that i was doing was using memory mapped files stream the memory mapped file was significantly faster than the other so i concerned if the code was harder to follow because the speed up was case i had was deciding to string in java or doing so should save but at a cost of in my case the space savings and the time was so i do the documenting it lets someone else know not to bother interning it if they want to see if a newer version of java makes it faster then they can

should probably be documenting all of your methods most important are public api methods published api private methods are sometimes not although i think they should just for clarity same goes with protected your comments should be and not just reiterate what the code a method is particularly it is advised that you document some people believe that code should be written clearly so that it require this is not always so comments should be used in these can automate the generation of javadoc comments for from eclipse via the code templates to save on the amount of documentation you have to another tip is to use the to prevent duplication of code comments between interfaces and implementation

silverlight runtime have support for avi files natively so you be able to use those with the you would need to do is actually parse the avi file by hand and pull out frames from that once you get to the point where you are parsing it potentially gets a little you plan on having this work on silverlight your avi file would need to contain wmv frames or frames in one of supported image or if you were working with i would set up a mediastreamsource and pass in the desired video frame to the mediastreamsource as my first if you are working with one of the image formats you should use image and set its source to a you can see an example where joe stegman has used this to help silverlight 2 support you were doing this in silverlight 3 in beta right the techniques are generally the same but the media format support grows a bit to include addition to raw or raw argb similarly on the imaging you now have the writeablebitmap which you could use to draw your your video is something like you would need to find a way to decode that frame so you could display it in

simply find nant easier to i dare say this is partly due to my background in but i found building a nant file for protocol buffers to be a simpler job than building an msbuild file for now there are things in the miscutil build which like to include but it seems ridiculously hard to dump the output of a task to a text the concepts are and there seem to be fewer gotchas in terms of when file collections are evaluated currently like using a setup which i previously thought was really silly i use nant for my build but invoke msbuild to do the actual my the idea of having two build systems for the same project is but i basically treat the msbuild part as a full build system just an easy way of and i never need to manually examine the project only interact with it via visual been able to evolve my protocol buffers build very easily this and i doubt have had the same experience if used going to try building it all with mono is released until then there are showstoppers in at which point see how portable the strategy

the classic unix file the answer would be the data for a created and deleted file would not necessarily ever make it to the though some of the directory metadata would probably still what happens does depend in part on the file system in that even calling guarantee that they are it only schedules the writing of the data back to hence the ancient injunction to type the command twice before bringing down the system doing that gave the computer enough time to complete the writing because it can write to disk faster than you can type twice if you happen to be using a real teletype at 110 posix standard says the function which is used by the function shall cause all information in memory that updates file systems to be scheduled for writing out to all file although is not necessarily complete upon return from linux has changed its definition to assure you that data is written to then that is a valid and useful but it the classic behaviour and beware translating the linux expertise to other are other such as that give more function shall request that all data for the open file descriptor named by fildes is to be transferred to the storage device associated with the file described by the nature of the transfer is the function shall not return until the system has completed that action or until an error is there are options to file descriptors that give other promises look them up in the posix standard

the entity framework is really limited in terms of what kind of many to many relationships it can the only thing that the visual studio designer will recognize is a table consisting of only two both foreign keys to the other two and where the primary key is a compound key on both of the foreign if you have control of your database one thing you could do is change your table to drop the column and make the primary key a compound key on and if you do then when you map the tables the entity framework will recognize this as a many to many you do that you have control of the database then you will need to make sure that the only fields that you map in your edmx are the fields which relate to the other and that you do not map the primary this is because the mapping wizard will discard and the storage mapping every time you option would be to not use a many to many mapping in the entity framework and instead just treat the relationship as another entity instead of having it subsumed into the remember if this has been improved in the forthcoming

there are a ton of resources out best advice to start is to find a pattern that you feel comfortable with and stick to it for the there is nothing worse then changing your mind the way that i have found and like to use is the repository or provider the repository pattern just makes sure you have standard access to like your store catalog or cms you create an interface that in my case expose sets of iqueryable the object or the data model are just standard classes with now extra fluff poco old clr interface icmsrepository void just implement the interface for your different like a linq to sql making sure to return the poco objects as the nice thing about this is that you can then make extension methods off of the iqueryable to get what you need static int return from c in qry select you to chain repository and filter to delay sql new sec nice thing about using the interface approach is the ability to test and mock it up or dependency inject your preferred storage at run method i have used and is used in the framework a lot is the provider this is similar except instead of an interface you create a singleton abstract your implementations on top of the abstract class will then define the storage access means flat the base abstract class will be also be resonsible for creating singleton based on take a look at this for on the provider you can look at similar

these questions are more about seeing the interviewer wrestle with the and the error boundary cases and the choice of suitable environment for the more than they are about the actual function here is written around the closed 4 cycle if the function f is only permitted to land only on signed 32bit then the various solutions above will all work except for three of the input range numbers as others have pointed minint will never satisfy the functional so raise an exception if that is an i am permitting my python function to operate on and return tuples the task spec admits it only specifies that two applications of the function should return an object equal to the original object if it is an would be asking for more detail about the allows my orbits to be nice and and to cover all of the input integers i originally envisaged the cycle to visit half integer but i want to get tangled up with rounding hence the tuple which is a way of sneaking complex rotations in as without using the complex arithmetic that no state needs to be preserved between but the caller does need to allow the return value to be either a tuple or an if return a if 0 raise valueerror make sure the tuple is well else return elif int if x this value satisfy the functional relation signed 2s complement 32 bit raise else send this integer to a tuple else not an int or a raise applying f to 37 twice gives and vice x x x x x f twice to zero gives x x we handle the one case for which the problem has no solution x x recent call file line in x file line in raise you think the function breaks the complex rule by mimicking the 90 degree rotations of multiplying by we can change that by distorting the here the tuples represent half not complex if you trace the orbits on a number you will get nonintersecting loops that satisfy the given functional n 2 if n is and not y is 2 and x is not more than implement this f2 by modifying and there are other have the intermediate landing points be rational numbers other than half a fraction module that might prove need a sign exercise has really nailed for me the delights of a dynamically typed i see a solution like this in

think that also think sort of answered your own because you point out how silly it would be to use them everywhere everything is a regular or to avoid using them at the have to make an intelligent decision about when regular expressions will help the code or hurt when faced with such a two important things to keep in mind are maintainability implies and those that are particularly averse to my guess is that never learned to use them i think most people who spend just a few hours with a decent tutorial will figure them out and become fluent very my suggestion for where to get that page talks about regular expressions in the context of found the information is very applicable there are a few things that are but i believe they are clearly and easy to	
think that any commonly used hash function will do what you want provide a unique representation of an the problem you are trying to my solution would be to have a backend table that records all not the changes but an identifier of the rows that have on a periodic basis callback to the server and get a list of all the objects that have and use this to decide on the client which rows need	
think that best place for extension methods is methods or that make existing api easier and cleanier by providing default values to arguments of existing methods or hiding repeating chains of method to the common beliefs that you can classes for which you do not have access to the source you you have no access to private methods and all you can do is to polish public api and bend it to your likings

think the pattern best for your situation is your have to know what class sending this data you would implement a logincontrollerdelegate in your you would implement a property like id when actually got something to communicate to the you would write object that should receive the login ids would incorporate the protocol like someotherclass nsobject you would implement the method in instead of your needing to have intimate knowledge of the other classes in your you simply establish a mechanism for sending that data to whatever object is interested in it when it becomes if you later change which object should receive the login you only need to choose a different

think your issue has anything to do with the transactionscope it sounds like describing the expected behavior of sql server changing the isolation level only affects not from sql server a transaction isolation level does not affect the locks acquired to protect data a transaction always gets an exclusive lock on any data it and holds that lock until the transaction regardless of the isolation level set for that for read transaction isolation levels primarily define the level of protection from the effects of modifications made by other that means is that you can prevent the blocking behavior by changing the isolation level the issuing the the isolation level prevent to prevent blocking the you would use the isolation but you would have to account for the possibility that records may be retrieved that have been by an open transaction they might go away if the transaction rolls

though gwt goes a long not giving the same flexibility and accessibility as a proper thouhg a gwt application can do almost everything a real application a number of factors indicates that rcp would be the best of widgets for editing or windows with different keys for often used real menu proper window that it easy to find in the menus for seldom used known base number of or complex animations or real time you think that your application needs a with several views and then the choice is and the workbench are not that easy to work but you get much for free if the application would benefit from the more and open working model with multiple open the application is for more occasional then gwt is really is really but its still a web and that sucks i want to do all my work in a web application where i can accidentally press a key and lose all my work and the keyboard even has a key next to the arrow keys that seems to be impossible to its powerful enough do do almost anything you can do in rcp but its still running inside the web and that can be that you can use java webstart to deploy rcp

time depends on a few of the size of the communication between and your integration projects take less time to very or huge projects will take more time to been on small projects where integration was been on huge projects spread across multiple component teams where integration took a very long to integrate also depends on how well you project communication across if your teams are not communicating it can take 3x or more time to integrate and work out all the related integration helps with the perception that integration takes less with ci the time to integrate is amortized over the life of the but again if you have a poor relationship with the other component teams to total time for all integrations will take is definitely better than the waiting until late in the development cycle to integrate is bound to cause you much the earlier you begin the integration the more comfortable each team becomes with the

turns out actually something built just for queues up the into the db and then sends them out periodically using the you can call every nice thing about is that it basically requires very little change in terms of how you already send you just need to inherit from instead of using this you have to worry about running rake tasks in the forking or anything like that and in effect you get a real mail server with queued messages that are deleted when the mail is actually this feature is important if you have a system that sends out large numbers of used to build a social network so i can attest to its a good article that talks about in i would strongly advise against rolling your own solution here as eric has built a solution to this very

two can actually be used together quite think of patterns as recipes with specific code to implement the design intent that is the and there can be many by mentioning a pattern name in your code letting a reader in on your intent when you wrote that the implementation is method gives you an with replaceable algorithm is normally defined in a method or private for gof implementation of this concept uses inheritance and method overriding to replace those still using template method if those steps are replaced by think about a class that wants to walk a binary tree inorder and at each intent is that the method is a template method the structure of the walk is always the the part that can be implemented as a method in the same class overridden in subclasses to change or in which case a strategy for	
two is the difference in time between when you send something and when the receiver gets there is an absolute minimum latency for all transmission governed by the distance and the speed of used in the way you is the amount of information that can be sent over a particular there is a physical limit on the amount of bandwidth you can have per volume it occupies we had computers made of pure energy that were as dense as but unlikely reach this anytime low connecting to a congested terminal on a high transmitting over the internet low modem on a congested high fill a car with hard drives and drive it to san is	
two numbers and each number uses and output datatype needs at and your above you have two 31 bit numbers because 1 0x7ffffffe uses 31 bits and you will need to typecast one of them to because it will do a 32 bit multiply and overflow before it casts to number of bits needed for fixed point a b quick example to show the above rule in a 49 decimal 0x31 hex 0x31 can write a function to count or if you just want a quick sanity check to confirm this use something like windows calc that will convert the number into binary form and count the bits	
two parts to your why are writes you say you have large you may want to clarify that with some the microsoft teams have demonstrated loads in less than an but of course using gear and specialized data warehousing been involved with data warehousing teams that regularly loaded so much data overnight that the transaction log drives had to be over a terabyte just to handle the quick but not a terabyte per find out why writes are want to compare your load methods to data warehousing for have you tried using staging table data and log files on different if not sure where to check out my perfmon tutorial to measure your system looking for how do you scale asked how to set up multiple database servers so that one handles the bulk load while others handle reads and some i would heavily caution against taking the approach because it gets a lot more complicated but using multiple servers for reads is not easiest way to do it is with log every x the primary server takes a transaction log backup and then that log backup is applied to the reporting some catches with this the data is a little and the restore process has to kick all connections out of the database to apply the this can be a perfectly acceptable solution for things like data where the end users want to keep running their own reports while the new data you can simply not do transaction log restores while the data warehouse is and the users can maintain connections the whole help find out what solution is right for consider adding the following to your size of your database in of millions of rows in the largest table having the size of your server storage box with 10 drives has different solutions available than a box hooked up to a method of loading data it are you using bulk are you using table

understand that it is more secure you use different but take my word for not a i even play one on reason i it to be more secure is that using extra information for encoding multiple keys and an unknown number of keys you publish the fact that encryption using the same key makes many codes easier to heard this for some codes but i it to be true for rot13 think the security scheme used by kerberos is a better one than simple double actually have one master key whose sole purpose is to encrypt the session key and the master key is used the session key is used to encrypt the real traffic and it has a limited this has two dudes have time to crack the session key by the time managed to do those session keys are no longer in same evil dudes get an opportunity to crack the master key simply because so rarely used would need a great many encrypted packets to crack the as i take that with a big grain of i work for the but then have to tell you that even if i did work for the you crack me that my kerberos depending on your is the mythological dog that guards the gates of a mascot for that security that same dog is called fluffy in the harry potter world once had a girlfriend whose massive german shepherd dog was called a similarly misnamed

want to be able to insert data from a table with an identity column into a temporary table in sql server tsql looks something create empty temp insert into select top from above code created with an identity and the insert subsequently fails with an error explicit value for the identity column in table can only be specified when a column list is used and is there a way in tsql to drop the identity property of the column in the temporary table listing all the columns i specifically want to use so that the code will continue to work if new columns are added to believe dropping and recreating the column will change its making it impossible to use select tried using as suggested in one not working see the repro what am i doing create test table not constraint primary key clustered insert some into create empty temp on i also tried off into top 1 from off drop test table that the error message explicit value for the identity column in table can only be specified a column list is and is i specifically want to use a column list as explained suggestion from but this gave the same create empty temp from testtable left outer join testtable m2 on where into top 1 from for why i want to do mytable is a staging table which can contain a large number of rows to be merged into another i want to process the rows from the staging my main and delete them from the staging table in a loop that processes n rows per i realize there are other ways to achieve get to however it suggested the following solution which does prefix with a column and drop the identity as as table drop column into top 1 from suggestion to store only the keys in the temporary table is also a good though in this specific case there are reasons i prefer to have all columns in the temporary to drop identity property of column in sql server

want to check the class of an object before doing something with it in your you should be using you want to have the interface define some each class implement those refer to the object by its and have the individual implementations of those objects return their values to the you describe a few more of the objects you think you people here will have opinions on how you should lay them but from what you may want a interface that defines some general you may also want a interface or something more hospital could be a class that implements receptiondesk could implement building could have a grid of usableitem inside was a common method to all furniture that actually did some you may consider making an abstractusableitem class that was an abstract class implementing usableitemand providing the if rotate was different in each implementing you would have that method in the but each like receptiondesk would do its own thing with the your code would do something desk new your if your mouse click on a screen rotated the object under and you really did need to check to see if the object could be rotated before doing something like instanceof usableitem was the interface or abstract some people feel that all design should be done via an interface contract and suggest an interface for every type of but i know if you have to go that

wanted to have more than one controller and view for same in but it turned out to be a little complicated than i what i want to do is something like this will show product details to will show some extra information together with product and some commands like edit goal is to seperate the urls for the visitors and the first approach was that create a subfolder in the controller and the view so the things would look this way can map the urls to the correct controllers without a problem that i specify their since the class names are the when i return the view from the controller under admin it does not display the index view under the folder but the one under know i can say path to return the view i but obviously not a good solution and i want to do question what is the best way to take care of this with the condition of urls having to be that a custom controller class that overrides the view method any other ones that needs to be overriden for this and makes sure the correct view is one is an ugly but would a custom view engine that also takes folders into exactly know how i can do but as far as i this should also solve the of one actually uses a different layout for but in theory this should also but i am still not sure if this is the best way to do because having different controller view folders under the different parts of the site is not exactly what i leaning towards the custom view engine that takes the folders into consideration when returns the but like i i know how to do in controllers and

was the last version to provide support for java so still widely used by shops that made the transition to or my stuck with deploying to an older weblogic best way to gain performance improvements is to use a mapping rather than having castor use reflection to your the mapping file can contain explicit xml element to java class and omit any translations you are not interested for if an xml record contains a billing information along with a history of the last 100 but all you care about is the billing you can explicitly map the appropriate xml elements to your billing information castor will ignore the remainder of the xml speeding up the marshalling final tip is to download the source code for castor even if you plan on building the code the documentation for been kept up to so some new features that appear to have been introduced in and higher have actually been added to castor as a quick comparison of the documentation and code will let you see what improvements have been recently made to castor

way to do this is actually something over by management employee e on by getting into the murkky area of queries and direct you to this column of ask tom on other answers work in simple cases but when you start wanting to do things like returning the top 3 management teams head and doing so consistently that run into is a key as tom a group by clause in a guarantee that the output data will sorted on the group by columns even if there is no order and until there is an order statement on a the returned cannot be assumed to be any without an order data may be returned in any order which the database feels returning this has always true and will always be in oracle database release see group returning data in a random order more often than this sample into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into employee values into management values into management values into management values into management values into management values

way to think of a hash is like a human fingerprint are also sometimes referred to as can any person in to a unique you cannot know who someone is by their fingerprint this is just like a you can easily work out but given only you cannot trivially tell the source reverse a finger you need to compare the fingerprint to a database of known the unknown fingerprint matches the unknown fingerprint belongs to a again you must do much the same thing you have a database with all mappings a then you lookup the row with the hash and it shows was hashed in order to get the other more common way is to simply try every combination of hash them and compare force while human fingerprints are possible to have two the just incredibly unlikely the same with some hashing algorithms are more susceptible to than question is if the hashes are all i be able to compress anything into a 40 char hashing is a great compression but to decompress is incredibly impractical beyond 10 ascii characters of you can compress anything to a 40 character but you cannot decompress it practically theoretically is a bit of a

would agree that json may be an excellent approach for passing but to go from php to you may want to use xml only because then you can use xml which may make parsing can then communicate back and forth via http connections or depending on which way data but i expect that it will flow from php so you could experiment with wcf to pass using a rest though php can do webservice client calls you communicate back from the with json or use a webservice response then you have a good decoupling between the two	
would appear that a simple scheme will work the number of points in the by first computing the convex only the points on the convex hull will contribute to any interaction with any convex bounding so retain only the subset of points on the perimeter of the can easily be argued that the minimal radius bounding must have one edge of the convex hull coincident along the diameter of the if some edge of the hull does not lie in the then there exists a different with smaller diameter that contains the same set of each edge in convex hull often has relatively few so this will go now it becomes a simple minimization if we choose to assume the edge in question lies on the then we merely need to find the center of the it must lie along the current line which we are considering to be the so as a function of the position of the point along the current just find the point which lies farthest away from the nominal by minimizing that we find the radius of the minimal along that line as a just choose the best of the possible found over all edges of the convex

would certainly ever checking in i would absolutely ban it is appropriate to check code into source saying do is too think we all agree with these check dead code into source check broken code into source at least to trunk and only very rarely to a private you have temporarily commented something out or broken something for debugging check the code in until you restore the code to its correct of are saying there are other such as removed or an incremental but incomplete improvement that includes a small amount of code as documentation of what comes or a 1 snippet of commented out code showing something that should be code should always be accompanied by a comment that says why it is commented out not just and gives the expected lifetime of the for following code does more harm than so is commented but needs to be replaced before release comment like the above is appropriate if you are delivering a hotfix to stop a bleeding and you have the immediate opportunity to find the ultimate after delivering the the code is a reminder that you still have something that needs do i check in one example is when i am tentatively removing something that i think a high probability will have to be in the near in some the code is there to serve as a direct reminder that this is the old version is in source control and you could just use a comment as a flag that something more is sometimes not code is the better when a bug is fixed by removing one line more two of sometimes just comment out the line with a comment to that code with a reason this sort of comment is and m only check in complete the task is too large break it into smaller completable this is the sometimes neither option is achievable when you are working on production code and have an critical problem to sometimes to complete a you need to put a version of code in the field for a this is especially true for data gathering code changes when trying to find the root cause of a the specific instance being asked about in the more general question as long as the developer is checking code into a private branch that will see but that developer perhaps someone the developer is collaborating it does little but that developer should never deliver such code into trunk or an trunk should always build and should always delivering unfinished code to trunk is almost always a very bad if you let a developer check unfinished or temporary code into a private then you have to rely on the developer to not forget to scrub the code before delivering into clarify in response to comments to other if code is commented out and checked my expectation that the code will function if uncommented drops with the length of time the code has been commented refactoring tools will not always include comments in their almost if i put code into the code is there to serve as a refined something more specific than that something needs to be done it is not something that should have a long if you can find code in every source then something is delivering code into trunk for reason should be a rare if this occurs then it becomes clutter and loses its

would there be a performance they perform the same functionality as c the only difference is that they catch more errors at and easier to search for in your source is exactly equivalent to and will generate exactly the same a f is exactly equivalent to and will generate exactly the same so the only cast that differs is can throw an but that is because it does things that the cast cannot so use unless you need its is usually safe to assume that compiler writers are given two different expressions that have the same semantics according to the it is usually safe to assume that they will be implemented identically in the the second example should be not of fixed it just to make it absolutely here is what the standard conversions performed by followed by a followed by a be performed using the notation of explicit type the same semantic restrictions behaviors if a conversion be interpreted in more than one of ways listed the that appears first in the list even if a cast resulting that interpretation is if since the cast is implemented in terms of the casts should be course they because the compiler generates the same code in any but more plausible than the casts being	
would use a variant of the i would extend the command pattern to make a iintervalcommand it would have a interval and a readonly canexecute property in addition to the execute you create a commandlist class that holds a list of it would have a method called checktoexecute that you pass it the current game the checktoexecute method would traverse the list calling canexecute for each canexecute will return true if the elapsed time has if canexecute return true then checktoexecute will call the execute method of the object implementing adding additional game events is a matter of creating a new class implementing instantiating the object and adding it to the the processing of the event is time consuming then the command could spawn the processing as a separate it will return false to canexecute property until the thread returns even if the interval has passed or you have it spawn off another thread if the interval passed avoid the giant case you could eliminate the database and setup the parameters when you instantiate the or keep it and use it as part of a factory that creates all your

writing a game development ide that creates and compiles projects been working on for the past few and am in the process of updating it to generate output not only for but also for thrillingly simple process for but still requiring some part of i have found it necessary to start generating an file as part of this to map dependent dll names to linux dependency names with confused about responsible for copying the file to the output name in a visual studio the build action for seems to normally be set to and its settings indicate that it be copied yet when visual studio compiles the project it generates sometimes found this to be when i use msbuild to build a solution file generated by the ide debugging msbuild copies to but when i compile the project with it like the config file being included as source code error a namespace does not directly contain members such as fields or and of course it copy it to the output when i include it as an is it my responsibility to simply copy to or is there a more standard way of doing it hardwired to take the first in my ide conceivable that the file would be renamed or another one added as in visual it seems odd to me that the ide has this secret action for config files think monodevelop behaves similarly in this regard because i find a special action for config files there i know how it even picks to what files this secret action copies to

you are a fortran programmer you have probably seen a subroutine accepting if you think about insane are too you run the risk of swapping and you quickly realize that some arguments always travel would make sense to pack them under a single entity that carries everything around as a non as independent this would reduce the number of arguments giving you only the burden to find proper this single entity is the your you say that a bank is an aggregate of those you can now declare a concrete variable of that which will represent and provide access to the single variables acchecks and so in order to do you have to use the so if your bank variable is called you can say for can imagine b as a containing different you move the all the shelves and their content move array is a group of entities of the same type or or and they are one after another so you can access each of them with a numeric remember unless specified arrays indexes in fortran start at 1 all the other major the first index is zero for your i suggest you integer is the but you write please also note that there is a difference between using the and the if you want to define a matrix which is a you have to use the what you wrote is the better if you write character this you write but your syntax is deprecated could be remember that better if you write one member variable per line in the a matter of but i prefer to see the full size of a type by having one line per member maxrows and i would write them as and parameters and stuff that is highly constant by tradition is identified with an all underscore separated name in any major to answer your here is an example of the use of an more integer myarray 0 equivalent to zeroing the single elements one by print g95 0 5 0 0 0 0 10 0 0 array is just like multiple variables with the same identified by an very useful to express or can of course do an array of an aggregated type you instead of a predefined type	
you are comparing operator overloading between java and you be talking about and java expose enough memory management detail for and need overload the other operators for pointer types at least one argument must be a class or enumerated so he be talking about providing different operators for operators in operate on values or const references to would be very unusual for operators which operator on values or const references to values to return anything other than a from obvious errors common to all functions returning a reference to a stack allocated object is the opposite of a memory or returning a reference to an object created with rather than a value is usually done no more than once in a career before being it would be hard to come up with a scenario where the common operators have memory there any need to create multiple versions depending on whether the operands are stack or heap allocated based on normal patterns of arguments to an operator are objects passed as either values or there is no portable mechanism in to test whether an object was allocated heap or if the object was passed by it will always be on the so if there was a requirement to change the behaviour of the operators for the two it would not be possible to do so portably in on many test whether the pointer to the object is in the space normally used for stack or the space normally used for but that is neither portable nor entirely even if you could have operators which took two pointers as no reason to believe that the objects are heap allocated just because they are that information simply exist in only duplication you get is for cases such as where the same operator is used as both an accessor and a then it is normal to have a const and a so you can set the value if the receiver is not that is a good thing not being able to mutate publicly accessible state objects which have been marked

you are using web control protocol will act as the queue to a certain provides delivery of a stream of bytes from program on one computer to program on another guarantees that if client sends packet then the server will received it in that then if you must reply back to the client in the same order as then you might need a default maximum worker thread is set to 12 threads per cpu so on a dual core you can run 24 connections at a depending on how long the calculation takes and what you mean by lot of you could try different simplest one is to use servicetimeouts and servicethrottling and only handle what you can and reject the ones you not an increase the second you could make the service completely implement two methods and accepts the stuff them into a queue a and returns a guid immediately like using instead of the client can use the returned guid as a claim ticket and call every few if the calculation has not finished you can return 404 for calculation must now be done by a separate process that monitors the third option is the most but the outcome is similar to that of the first option of putting cap on incoming

you decide to place validation prior to insertion in the database is where you should catch these process of validation should take place in one place and one place depending on how your application is it procedural or object it is object then are you using an active record gateway pattern or data mapper pattern to handle your database you have domain objects that are separate from your database abstraction you will need to decide on where to place this logic in your my domain objects contain the validation logic and functions with data mappers that actually perform the insert and update functions to the so before i ever attempt to save information to the i confirm that there are valid

you dispose of it once just because we have street sweepers mean we should just go around littering the in the example if the font is needed for the lifetime of the object then dispose of the font in that there are many things that would simplify my code but that justify those changes sometimes there are things that you should even though a always a good idea to tidy up after when you no longer need dispose of that way you can avoid nasty race out of memory drawing and garbage find that best practice to dispose of disposable objects if you no longer need them unless there is a justifiable reason not to as you own the it is more difficult to track down the root cause of a problem than it is to code defensively up regards to call dispose before you release your last reference to the the resources it is using will not be freed until the garbage collector calls the font finalize say what the resources are but the fact that they explicitly state that this should be done implicitly adds importance to calling

you really willing to do dev work with no seems to me that would limit you to practically trivial after a very brief learning i think find the matlab integrated debugger to be fantastic a vs you insist on doing your best option is to compile your to be runnable stand that would require access to the that there is a significant difference between the compiler distributed with matlab versions up to and those distributed with matlab know the compiler version in the compiler generated that could be than edited and compiled from 7 the compiler did no or any code generation for that running a program today practically runs it on a virtual matlab machine called the which encompasses almost all matlab it is a massive one mcr installer weighted 130m last time i debate on this can still be found on but not important in the mcr approach seems closer to what you for me works perfectly on windows it launches matlab as a but that would deprive you both of a text editor a

you say do you mean code or infrastructure argue the infrastructure services and rather than the gives the most benefit to and ease of the examples you give are in the standard libraries of most languages or are very also just going to assume version control is a since its so integral to all say the important infrastructure would be a this lets people write whatever code they check it and make sure it works with everyone most important would be these let people develop faster and establish standards for and as common libraries are used the importance of the continuous build since small changes in those can cause problem with common is they take a lot of effort to design well so worth reusing and it takes a long time to get them to that most will start as specific to a and then someone will hack it into their followed by some then copy and after years someone will audit the code and start merging them into a common a plan should be made for upgrading common libraries and how to have two versions of them at another hidden drawback is they allow faster development in the short but hinder development in the long as people become locked into older versions is more true of third party would be this means common tools to simplify checking and otherwise having to interact with the code in any things that automate marking bugs as resolved when you submit a or notify continuous builders that dependencies have or automatically running tests before you submit a making tests easy to would be which is a simple extension of build this means that an app is self this has two machine reuse is and more its incredibly easy for a developer to get started they need to install extra or change something in or set something in their environment it just builds and i can think if everything uses the same monitoring then people have to monitor common it also makes it easier to identify problems since all the data is in one grepping and groking logs is a having a centralized place where all logs get stored in a structured format makes it easy to search and find on a large this lets developers testers and releasers release without stepping on each

you want to create a managed front end for a native you will have to marshal data back and there is really no way to avoid this currently facing a similar issue in one of our current the approach taken is to use pinvoke to talk managed with a few we only pinvoke blittable types which helps reduce the cost of marshaling because the clr can just implement it as a memory communicating native we use com we try to apply the same rules with regards to but found that you often have to include many com objects in this scenario which prevents this approach worked quite well from we spent a bit of time up front getting the primitives defined for the data but after marshalling became routine for lack of a better an overhead but a lot cheaper than a full
