a connection to the browser the browser has already made a connection to the it either buffers what you write in and then transmits the data at the end of the or it makes sure all the headers have been written to the network connection and then returns a which writes data directly to that network the buffering scenario there may be a fixed buffer and if you exceed that the data written so far will be to the network the big advantage of having a buffer at all is that if something goes wrong you can change your response to an error if already started writing the response when something goes not a lot you can do to indicate the error also the matter of transmitting the content length before any of the for if you run out of buffer before completing the reliably informed that the response will use a chunked

a way to automatically block browser requests hitting your server side but there are ways to identify which scripts have been triggered by your application and which is usually done using something called the basic idea is that the page making the ajax request should generate a unique token is typically a hash of unix timestamp salt this token and timestamp should be passed as parameters to the ajax the ajax handler script will first check this token the validity of the unix timestamp if it falls within 5 minutes of the token if the token checks you can then proceed to fulfill this this token generation checking can be coded up as an apache module so that it is triggered automatically and is separate from the application scripts be able to generate valid tokens they figure out your and so you can safely ignore in mind that storing a token in the session is also another but that buy any more security than your authentication

absolutely positive about this but my best guess queue is a system object that you access with win32 api it is not in your process address space at so the interrupt handlers can access it through the hal abstraction of the that call took the various subparts of a bigger message and mashed them into a so translatemessage would add the when it found the corresponding it would also turn various button click messages into doubleclick messages based on internal setting and the timestamps of the whether it still does this in i is probably where window message hooks get so if a hook on your it is either called here or when the getmessage is not other than dispatchmessage just looks up the wndproc address associated with the window and calls not much else for it to that

access to git and i need to incorporate a repository into two separate project repositories while minimizing the overhead of people on either project need the ability to easily branch off their mainline trunk while also branching off the the user modifies the repo and ready to their edits into their mainline trunk their edits will also be regressed against the other mainline to ensure that their edits are compatible with both know this is relatively easy to do with git except for the mechanism that does the continuous integration into a mainline which is homebrew scripts but is there an easy way to do this in both subversion and almost solves my subversion but what if the external repository in there an equivalent to or for can this be done with post clone i think i figured out how to do if you need to pull the common repo into both subversion and you need to have the common reuse repo in subversion so you can use like emk for bitkeeper you need to create a trigger which knows to do a checkout command from a subversion do you incorporate shared ip into multiple projects while still allowing easy

actually like using and feel they can be very useful for making logical groupings in a for example i had a class with various derivatives which certain methods corresponded to different things child object splitting these up into regions makes it clearer where things and can give you a good overview if you have appropriately named could split these into partial like the designer class but ultimately that reaches a very similar and you have a lot more class files that need to name can also use but some of the projects working searching is and much better if you can learn your way around the and find things quickly than having to wait for a time consuming have also used them within a few algorithms for understanding and honestly i think advocate this and always better to split things up into but that so easy with the algorithms that working therefore breaking it up into logical and then adding more comments detail within the regions seemed the best bet to me at the and honestly is taking a modular approach to you have a with a description of what it you have regions within the method that explain what that section of code does and then you can go down to individual lines of code which may also be so it helps you to drill down to get more information quickly and think are fine for logical grouping in i think they can work in but should be avoided if splitting code into more methods is the most suitable

am not sure what counting your bugs is going to do with out something to compare it what if the software you made was very hard and had lots of edge you need some kind some kind of though one of the other answers was clearly a joke code reviews are also probably a good if you have too many bugs hire better engineers or have them write less added after considering bug is a like a unique sucky snow flake they have different levels of impact on your customers and i would at least take this into maybe adding severity measure of customer push for and engineering hours spent fixing it might help improve my concern i guess is that this is still over simplification of when it comes to developing software quality product a recently released game called fallout 3 won tons of awards and made lots of money least i but was also a buggy hunk of junk on pc at make sure you are tracking and optimizing the correct tracking bugs vs time is just tracking of bugs vs reading any more into it requires some level of assumption however correct or are your bugs are but one part of software if you want to continue you to support your software maintainability is a lot of times bug fixes can make things less maintainable if your coder did things in a this in turn makes future fixes and features harder and fixes can add new

am trying to decide between two possible implementations and am eager to choose the best one need to add an optional blob field to a table which currently only has 3 simple it is predicted that the new field will be used in fewer than maybe even less than of cases so it will be null for most rows in fact most of our customers will probably never have any blob data in first inclination was to add a new table to hold just the with a foreign key in the first he predicts this will have performance benefits when querying the first thoughts were that it is more logical and easier to store the blob directly in the original none of our queries do from that table so my intuition is that storing it directly have a significant performance going to benchmark both choices but i was hoping some sql gurus had any advice from mssql and overhead of adding a blob field to a

an easy way to do make sure syntax highlighting is on with the command to get a listing of all the highlight group and samples of what they look the group looks like it stands out well in my so use that in my example you can use any of the other like or match error pattern will keep you from greedily matching the largest even though other people are suggesting you use the regular expression probably not what you because it will match everything in between if there are two or more such patterns on a example will match this entire these words should not be highlighted same example but with will only match stuff inside these words should not be highlighted regular a common trick to make a group that matches everything but the character that you want to end your instead of using the which will match as many characters as it in this we make the group which says everything except this works the way you want it add the syntax match line without the to your

answer locking is necessary if only both threads can use the same shared resources at the same there enough information about your specific but i have few only during writing makes no it only adds some but not prevent from any concurrent access until the reader is also correctly would be necessary if file operations which modify structures connected with the descriptors are not synchronized in any it may happen that p1 could start writing to the file when p2 is still if reading and writing operations modify the same system structures without any underlying synchronization you will end up with corrupted hard to say if this is the case here because you mention which particular function you file operations are synchronized on most so it be a what you wrote about bytes portions of the explicit locking seems to be not necessary impose p1 produces quantum of when the data is ready to be read p1 notifies p2 about that the event passing should be internally p2 knows that it could read quantum of data and then needs to wait for subsequent it may happen that subsequent notification would be sent before previous one is the events needs to be queued you can also use semaphore instead of events	
answer the root to your am trying to figure out if i can bring a file with actionscript into after when flash exports a it exports the literal frame by frame animation of the no execution of not even any movie clips on stage actually play like they would in a running this is because video is not a running just literally frame by frame of what pixels should show what probably why you are getting a blank did a couple frames involve reducing the main timeline to not having any real part in the maybe relying more on movieclips because then definitely just get a blank you want scripted animation caught as video then the best thing to do is learn the after effects based i believe it is called and it is based on javascript like as2 if you want an actual flash scripted animation then you will have to capture it as it plays on using software such as

application i am working on is suffering from a slow memory i have used cdb with sos to try to determine what is happening but the data does not seem to make any sense so i was hoping one of you may have experienced this application is running on the 64 bit it is continuously calculating and serialising data to a remote host and is hitting the large object heap a fair most of the loh objects i expect to be once the calculation is complete and has been sent to the remote the memory should be what i am is a large number of object arrays interleaved with free blocks of taking a random segment from the 000000005b5b1000 address mt 0000064280c7c970 00000000001661d0 1901752 00000642788d8ba8 1056 00000000001661d0 5988848 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 6481336 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 7346016 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 7611648 00000642788d8ba8 00000000001661d0 264808 i would expect this to be the case if my application were creating large objects during each does do this and i accept there will be a degree of loh fragmentation but that is not the problem the problem is the very small object arrays you can see in the above dump which i cannot see in code being created and which are remaining rooted note that cdb is not reporting the type when the heap segment is i am not sure if this is related or if i dump the marked reports it rank number of elements type elements of the object array are all strings and the strings are recognisable as from our application i am unable to find their gc roots as the command hangs and never comes back have even tried leaving it i would very much appreciate it if anyone could shed any light as to why these small object arrays are ending up on the what situations will put a small object array in does anyone happen to know of an alternative way of ascertaining the roots of these in theory i came up with late yesterday is that these object arrays started out large but have been shrunk leaving the blocks of free memory that are evident in the memory what makes me suspicious is that the object arrays always appear to be 1056 bytes long 128 8 for the references and 32 bytes of idea is that perhaps some unsafe code in a library or in the clr is corrupting the number of elements field in the array bit of a long shot i to brian rasmussen accepted the problem has been identified as fragmentation of the loh caused by the string intern i wrote a quick test application to confirm void const int iterations for index index string str for index index string str application first creates and dereferences unique strings in a this is just to prove that the memory does not leak in this obviously it should not and it does the second unique strings are created and this action roots them in the intern what i did not realise is how the intern table is it appears it consists of a set of pages object arrays of 128 string elements that are created in the this is more evident in sos of gc 0 starts at 1 starts at 2 starts at segment allocation segment begin allocated 00b21000 010029bc object heap starts at segment begin allocated 01b21000 01b8ade0 size heap size a dump of the loh segment reveals the pattern i saw in the leaking 01b21000 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 793040bc 00175e88 16 free total 1568 mt count totalsize class 784 12544 784 421088 1568 that the object array size is 528 than because my workstation is 32 bit and the application server is 64 the object arrays are still 128 elements the moral to this story is to be very careful if the string you are interning is not known to be a member of a finite set then your application will leak due to fragmentation of the at least in version 2 of the our there is general code in the deserialisation code path that interns entity identifiers during i now strongly suspect this is the the intentions were obviously good as they wanted to make sure that if the same entity is deserialised multiple times then only one instance of the identifier string will be maintained in object heap

assuming you mean char for the first line of code you get a rather strange the basic principal is that ascii codes for digits are the code for the code for and so subtracting simply converts from the ascii code to the actual so and so note that this will only work if the character subtracting from is an actual digit otherwise the result will have little without context the of this code is impossible to as for what it appears that the if statement evaluates as true when bit i of is not that particular bit is a i believe the operator gets executed before the as the operator has very low the code could make better use of parentheses to make the intended order of operations in this the order of operations might not matter though i believe the result is the same either this is simply creating a number with all bits except bit i set to a convenient way of creating a mask for bit i is to use the expression bitwise or operation in this case is used to set the bits specified by the row constant to if these bits are not it sets if already set it has no

basically manage all your memory according to the management programming guide for in you basically only need to worry about objects that you you own an object if you create it you create an object by specifically allocating it using or copying it using or one of their if you own an you are responsible for releasing it when you are finished with other object not owned by if you need to use such an object for any extended period outside the scope in which you received you need to specifically take ownership of the object by either sending it a message or copying answer your last if you are creating a lot of temporary objects in a loop or some other you can create your own autorelease see the for nsautoreleasepool for more information about using please that you should really only do this after profiled your application and found that it is using too much memory and would benefit from this kind of if you are creating and releasing a lot of heavy objects and want to rely on autorelease you can specifically allocate and initialize them and then make sure to release them on your own as soon as finished with most objects that have convenience creators have similar initializers for creating the object

been getting into seaside myself but in many ways it is very hard to get which has nothing to do with the smalltalk which can be picked up extremely the challenge is that you are really protected from writing html find in most frameworks when you get stuck on how to do something there is always a work around of solving it by using the you may later discover that this solution causes problems with clarity down the road and there is in fact a better solutions built into the framework but you were able to move on from that problem until you learned the right way to do have templates so you get that no problems have permanently stumped me but some have taken me longer to solve than i would have the flip side of this is you end up learning the seaside methodology much quicker because you you decide to go the seaside route be afraid to post to the seaside mailing list at i found it intimidating at first because you see a lot of beginner questions there due to the low traffic but people are willing to help beginners there are a handful of seaside developers who monitor stackoverflow good

being too a file can be larger than the address the of the file is limited by os memory but only the part of the file looking at at one i guess technically you could map multiple views of discontinuous parts of the file at so aside from overhead and page length only the total of bytes looking at that poses a you could look at bytes to and bytes to with two separate ms look at the it effectively takes a file offset and a

best other than a distributed version is using rsync over i keep a couple of machines in sync by doing the following on each ssh mentioned using a macbook rsync is on mac os as far as i it need to be installed and the beauty of rsync is that it looks for modifications and only copies modified files it do merging of simultaneous modifications like a distributed version control system but if like me where you do some work on your laptop then some work on your rsync is the best way to send all the changed files only the changed from one to the other when you switch

best way to get rid of warnings is to address the suspicious code that the warnings complain that change the code such that it is no longer just seek to disable the generation of warnings need to provide more details about the specific warnings concerned and the accompanying but remember to search previous answers here see the warnings are actually text literally in your not messages issued in the compiler the way to get rid of those is to search for the keyword i consider whether the issue that it warns about has been addressed or is still a valid fix the problem if there is and the delete that warning for does a default and if does it need should you use to a property not really asking how to delete a line of are already gone through the whole file and determined that none of the warnings are a quick way of removing all the warning you already have on your then you have a complete development environment get a the option tells it to invert the search thus printing all lines that contain the search those get written into the new then replace the old file with the new

binary distribution of rsync recognize the ssh the command you are trying to execute probably works fine when you put into the shell because something like bash knows how to interpret the ssh command to establish a use the ssh program to create a connection for the rsync from your debugging information i think rsync is expecting a connection but instead receives a string which it fails to get around this you have to let bash do the work for look at in the section on threads to tend the you would need to fork an instance of a command shell and write your command to the shell so something like p osw new bw new writing would probably want to read the processes output too because it will stop executing if you do not read the link provided covers the topic

compute a you have to traverse both trees you have to examine the properties of each node and perform the hash for if a is in the you have to iterate over its characters and do some then you have to combine the hash of the node with the hash of the computing a hash value for two structures is of the same order a little more as comparing them for equality one in because when performing an equality you can stop as soon as you detect any a single equality test is going to be much on is likely to be beneficial only if you cache the hash value and reuse it many and because hash values for different trees can you still need to have equality comparison

curious about the not mentioned in the reference guide and in the javadoc described extension of the which provides ability to create new users and existing implementing the interface you have to implement five methods of its own and one which it inherits from the userdetailsservice which it methods userexists and the inherited method the spring security framework there are two concrete implementations of and the interface and the concrete implementations are implemented by luke seems the spring security framework never uses the concrete conclusion is that the interface is included purely as a convenience interface which the user of the framework may or may not decide to perhaps there were some thought that later on more concrete implementations would exist and take out some of the work for the framework looking for is more for the information to be of value it has to come directly or guess this is most from someone with insight into the framework development anyone else can just make like i just did just a convenience there more such interfaces and classes which appear in the reference guide as interested in knowing as it might be helpful to me during through all interfaces and classes to see which ones are actually used inside the framework is a bit tideous and it could also be error prone if reflection is involved calls are made which my ide figure what is the userdetailsmanager interface used and

development i mean on a small boat rocking up and down and someone is holding a gun to your i are the tools at your disposal making the problem is typically a cycle of observe the in some environments this is a very quick and painless but in others very we end up using little tricks to help us observe the result and run the code was thinking of this because i just started using ssis tool included with sql server been quite challenging for me to make mainly because no guidance on what all the dialogs mean and also because the errors are very cryptic and most of the time really tell you what the problem think the easiest environment had to work in was vb6 because there you can edit code while the application is running and it will continue running with your new you even have to run it this can save you a lot of in netbeans with java you can do the it steps out of the method and the method with the new sql server 2000 when there is an error in a trigger you get no stack which can make it really tricky to locate where the problem occurred since an insert can have a cascading effect and trigger many in oracle you get a very nice little stack trace with line numbers so resolving the problem is very of the things that i see really help in locating error messages when things go a stack trace when a problem environment where you can then output the value of variables and step to follow the execution graphical debug environment that shows the code as screen that can show the current values of variables so you can print to to turn on debug logging on a production is the worst seen and what can be done to get around these really intend for this to be flame really just looking for ideas to improve systems so that if creating something think about these things and not contribute to also looking for creative ways around these limitations that i can use if i find myself in this is the most challenging development environment ever had to work in and what did you do to get around the

difficult to fully answer your question without specifying a programming answer with respect to because for all i know the answer might be is a then a server first binds to a port by calling this creates a socket in server it is prepared to catch data on port one calls this throws the socket into server this means that a request for a connection will be received by this socket to 10 pending requests at a the time we get to the operating system already knows listening on port merely says what going to do with the requests we in will return where connection is a connection through another in this is not very different from the socket object that the client has reasonably symmetric from here on

fundamental problem that i have with this type of rating system is that you end up with your team in competition with each rather than cooperating with one what would be the incentive to work on hard parts of the code if you knew that you might pay a just pick the easier things that are less prone to why help your colleague improve their code when doing so benefits them and potentially harms you with respect to the rating think you are better off using peer pressure to increase code no one wants to write crap and no one wants to be known for writing make a real effort to drive defects down with tdd or at the very least with unit move to continuous integration and publicize who breaks the make it the responsibility of the person breaking the build to fix it before they can create any new things like this will drive quality everyone is on board with the quality rate the not the make it a real benefit to work if you have slackers who are taking advantage of the team and everyone will know who they are work with them to improve and if they or cut your losses and find someone who fits better with the if you have the right it probably will never get to this if the wrong both you and they are better off knowing it and moving on to a better someone on the team really goes above and reward them with something but make sure it really was an extraordinary effort beyond the rest of the if the the team mind because know that their shared reward was in large part due to that all of the above should be taken as general although they like to call it management really more of an understanding your dynamics is complicated but i think the general rule ought to be to encourage and reward

generally try to do the initializer list when i for one this makes it explicit that you are initializing code in the const memebers to be initialized this you just put code in the it is quite possible someone may decide to come along and move a big chunk of it into a routine can be taken overboard i have a coworker who likes to create classes that have 2 pages of initilizer no constructor and perhaps 2 pages for the entire rest of the i find that really tough to	
generating the list you might be able to create it as a dictionary at source allows for value van defaultdict is the way to go i would mentioned in the defaultdict is not required here unless you need to deal with corner cases like several values with the same key in your if you can originally generate the as a you save yourself having to iterate back over it	
generation functions instead of data tables where inline frequently used macros into resolution for variables larger than the native machine size 8 bit try to get rid of 16 and 32 bit variables doubles and quadruples some code the micro has a smaller instruction set enable it in the the memory is segmented paged or then code so that fewer global calls call need to be code and variable usage to eliminate global memory global memory usage if it can be placed on the stack then so much the sure compiling with debug turned off on some processors it makes a big data that be generated on the fly then decompress into ram at startup for fast into the compiler options it may be that every call is automatically but you might be able to safely disable that on a file by file basis to reduce size you still need more space than with with turned then look at the generated assembly versus unoptimized then the code where the biggest changes took place so that the compiler generates the same optimizations based on tricky c with optimization turned you may have several statements that make similar b b creating anew variable and making some comparisons in advance will save the compiler from duplicating b b is one of the optimizations the compiler does for you automatically if you turn it there are many and you might consider reading a bit of compiler theory if you want to learn how to do this by hand in the c

goes like are but users will give you processing time in their browsers for code is relatively expensive compared to code on any site big enough to need to run more than one there are some things like data validation and retrieval that you leave to the like to do them on the because it means faster response times for the users and less server infrastructure for but security and accessibility concerns mean that code is typically happens is that you do you write your server side logic because you have but you also write the same logic in javascript in the hopes of providing faster responses to the user and saving your servers a little extra work in some since all programmers here we should immediately spot the new not only the extra work involved in developing two sets of the same but also the work involved in maintaining the bugs that inevitably result because the platforms match up and the bugs introduced as the implementations drift apart a little over the idea is that you can write code so that the same code runs on both the server and the this would appear to solve most of the you get the full set of both server and client logic done all at no no double also nice when your developers only need to know one language for both server and client in the real world it work out so the problem is server view of a page is just too different from the client view of a the server needs to be able to do things like talk directly to a database that just be done from the the browser needs to do things like manipulate a dom that match up with control the javascript engine of the meaning there will still be important language differences between your server code and your client database is normally a bigger bottleneck than the web so savings are just about everyone knows a little not that many developers really know and understand javascript completely insurmountable technical you constrain the language to a of javascript well supported across most provide an ide that knows this subset and the make some rules about page structure to minimize dom and provide some javascript for inclusion on the client to make the platform a little nicer to the result is something like aptana which can be pretty in the there are just too many pitfalls and little compatibility issues to as expensive as additional servers are still cheap compared to additional and most programmers know how to be much more productive using something really like to see is partial when a page is requested or a form submitted the server platform does validation in perhaps as a plugin to the web server completely independent from the rest of but the is built using the platform of your

good generic solution is to use heap size this involves minimal effort and is between any type of object object by instantiating and destroying your objects many times and garbage collecting in and then taking the you avoid compiler and jvm optimizations that alter results and get a fairly accurate if you need an exact answer down to the byte then this may not be the solution for but for all practical applications that i know of memory requirement it works extremely the code below will do just public class sizeof public static void throws exception all that we are going to array to keep strong references to allocated final int count 10000 or so is enough for small objects new long heap1 allocate discard the first for i i object instantiate your data here and assign it to your code if else object discard the heap1 take a heap long heap2 take an heap final int size heap1 size size a helper method for creating strings of desired and avoiding getting tricked by string public static string int final result new for i i return new this is our way of requesting garbage collection to be aggressive it is depends on the jvm to a large it is almost always better than a single private static void throws exception for whatever reason it helps to call using several method for r r private static void throws exception long usedmem1 usedmem2 for i usedmem2 usedmem1 private static long return private static final runtime end of

have two questions regarding a how to escape potential apostrophes or any other characters that would cause an not worried about sql how to use in with and include results that have a i seem to find any advice for the first option since every one says use parametrized that a queries which pretty sure you do with the the situation is like i know what the values are going to be ahead of time since the list is retrieved from a i know i could parse the string before passing it to the select but sure there is some ansi built in away of doing it which afraid i aware that two apostrophes in a row would escape the character if i knew where it was going to be located but i know the exact location when i receive now for the actual select what looking to do is allow the user to free form type into a text this text field will use 4 different columns to filter so the user could type in several items separated by space which would then perform a query per their the itunes search box which allows you to type free form album song etc or you could be specific and only search by one type of know how to do an in or a like by themselves but not sure how i could put them together escaping the apostrophes and including results that match but might have a null in one of the and of course do something that is supported by the in like the user in the case above provided lu which should return a record for the more information they provide would further refine the any is the technical specs regarding my expression using in and

i notice that you go into some detail about the problem but mention the information provided in section 4 of specification for the deflate compressed data the format used in which leads me to believe you might have missed this basic approach is a chained hash table using sequences as as long as the chain is not all the entries along it are scanned to eliminate false eliminate matches that are too and pick the longest match out of those that their recommendation is shaped by the factor of it may be that they knew of a more effective technique but could not be sure that it was not covered by always wondered why one find the longest matches by examining the matches for the sequences that start at the second byte of the incoming the third and weeding out matches that match if your incoming data is and got hash matches for at offsets 302 and 416 but your only hash match for is at offset you know that unless you have two entirely coincidental overlapping hash matches unlikely then 302 is your longest note their recommendation of optional ironically does more instead of automatically taking the longest match that starts at the first byte of the incoming the compressor checks for an even longer match starting at the next if your incoming data is and your only matches in the sliding window are for and for better off encoding the as a literal byte and the as a

i understand the open session in view pattern need not necessarily mean a unit of work is open for the entirety of the i handle this not webforms but the principle is the by explicitly defining a unit of work in my controller before the controller method returns any database transaction has been so i can handle any data update errors properly at that the session stays open even after the transaction has been for my the open session in view is useful mainly to allow lazy loading of related objects in the view there were 2 main reasons i chose to do it this want to hold any database transactions open while the view is being rendered to the response not and with database the shorter the a having an explicit unit of work is not much extra nhibernate errors that occur in the view stage are less important for me the and any updates have already gone so i can just handle those with a generic redirect error

i was talking with a friend of mine who had started a class a couple months ago first exposure to we got onto the topic of and and he made the point to me that he felt it was for all of the issues breakable i agreed with him on all those but i held back in saying it was only because i felt in languages like could instead become native code microsoft so chose to change the implementation of from a jit runtime environemnent to one which compiles directly to native code like your program question am i out to lunch i it may take a lot of work may break too many but there some type of magical barrier which prevents code from being compiled natively one wanted to do there was a time where was considered a very language it still but not as much as in the yet now the bedrock with for native the idea that could one day be on the same level as in that respect seems only to be a matter of time and effort to not some fundamental flaw in the design of the i should add that if native compilation of is why does microsoft choose not to go that why have they chosen the jit bytecode managed code ever become

implementing any sort of metrics ask what is it you want to measure productivity are you not listening but why is this important humans in metrics will innevitably try to optimize it for their own knowing you should be able to use this optimization in your yourself then if someone optimize the what will they be concentrated on direct your metric in measuring someting that will positively effect the thus instead of measuring bugs per programmer which only gives amunition to management to fire if things go try to measure where and why the bugs not who made bugs per bugs per bugs per code bugs per feaures would be much more productive metrics and will help identify of course you can always tie it to someone as there is always an indirect link to a but before you place a programmer on the forefront of the blame war you better be darn sure is the yourself what kind of environment you want to create what will the reaction of the directors will be when faced with the publication you measure and make them look bad then you are asking for if you peasure product then the focus will not be on making themselves look good but making the product look this in turn will be a much better motivator and will foster positive team your metric any sort of information hiding will cause adverse reaction and thus if you publicize your metrics be carefull on what they if you really isist on measuring people then measure them directors veryone should have the same then hide the knives and place metal detectors on the cause transparency with people ina company only works one from the top looking

in many i am designing a database that should keep record of previous versions of the rows changed in each standard solution to this problem is to keep a history table for each data whenever a row needs to be updated in the data a copy of the current row gets inserted to the history table and than the row in the data table gets disadvantages of this solution for of 2 tables instead of case the structure of the table needs application needs to know both of the tables instead of of the tables might need to be short to keep a convention of the table name and the history table name for am considering a different solution and would like to know if each we add the column a row gets inserted to the it will get inserted with a row gets a copy of the original row will be duplicated to the same table with the change of and the original row will get updated as needed keeping that in my rows are updated at an average of 10 assume that at least of the actions performed by the application happens only on the recent version of the database is an oracle 10g so to keep the table we can split the table to 2 the and the partitioning a good way of solving the history data keeping this solution limits other partition potential to these rows management in

in templates and generics are compared to java generics which are but they have also large like in there is runtime support by using getting an object describing the types used to instantiate a have and all it does with types is done at compile biggest difference between generics and templates indeed are that generics are better type they are always in the sense that they allow operations that are not stated valid at the time of defining the chief designer raised as a reason of that the added complexity it would have taken to have implied not well versed with so i talk further talk about about how matters are in and how they are going to be so that people think stuff is all templates are not if you do an at template definition time it is implied that the operation will succeed at instantiation not even required to a compiler that the template is syntactically checked for if it contains a syntax then that error has to be diagnosed at any diagnose before that is a pure goody of the implied constraint have shown to be easy for the template designer in the short because they have to care about stating the valid operations in their template they put the burden on the user of their template so the user has to make sure he fulfills all those often it happens that the user tries seemingly valid operations but with the compiler giving the user hundreds of lines of error messages about some invalid syntax or not found because the compiler know constraint in particular was violated in the first it lists all parts of code paths ever involved around the faulty place and all not even important and the user will have to crawl through the horrible error message is a fundamental which can be solved by just stating at the interface for a template or generics what properties a type parameter has to as far as i know can constraint the parameter to implement an interface or inherit a it solves that on a committee has long seen there is need to fix these soon will have a way to state such explicit constraints note as in the following requires t return a compiler signals an error at that because the expression as written is not marked valid by the this first helps the designer of the template to write more because the code is already to some degree to what is possible the programmer can now state that requires t return a it will the by seeing appearing as the return automatically implied that is because that use of appears in the rather than in the templates the other requirements were stated using requirement the user will get a appropriate error message if he uses a type that have an decouples the requirements from the the above works for primitive types aswell as for in this they are more but quite a bit the rules that state when and when requirements are satisfied are you can with the new rules say the requires call with an that would work by just writing a concept map for that teaches the compiler how an int can be it will get quite handy in loops like the programmer can tell the compiler how an int can satisfy the concept of an you could actually write such code in if you only write the appropriate concept which really all that enough with i hope i could show you that having templates constrained is not all that but in fact because the relationship betweens types and the operations on them within the templates are now known by the and i even written about which are another nice thing in remember that is future not yet but it will approximately at then we will have to wait for some compiler to implement that all from concepts were accepted into the draft but have been voted out at late of too but perhaps we will see it again in the next all

is an interesting situation because you can have an infinite number of different depending on your tastes and their own personal are a couple of things you can be doing to manage this situation probably the easiest would be to just use style is quick and and this is what style overrides are there but as this does not fit well with this separation to separate them a little you could build some css information on page load and then insert it into the tag of your this still keeps the html and the css somewhat even though not technically sepating other option would be to build the css and then output that to a would not be efficient my if you were on every page build a new css file that accounts for your unique this would sort of defeat the the same thing as the second using the just making it look even if you used techniques such as caching to try to limit how often you have to build a css will the ends really justify the is a completely subjective topic and you in the choose what most comfortable

is the kind of behaviour that is often seen in event driven gui frameworks when one wants to do continuous going to guess that is called from a button click or maybe from some point during the application startup in any here is going uses the main application thread to drive an event the event loop is something like problem you are seeing is that updates to the screen are done during a paint if you are running some code during a mouse click event or any other then all the drawing you are doing is queued up and will be drawn to the screen on the next paint sometimes it takes awhile for this to sink best way to address this is to change your approach a one way is to throw away your while loop and setup a qtimer set to fire every 5 in the timer slot you can draw one when the timer fires draw the next you want a more direct and less elegant quick try calling right after your call to this of the will force the application to clear out any queued up events which should include paint should also mention that is merely adding new scene objects to the scene on each iteration covering the ones that were added during the last think of the scene as a fridge door and when you call you are throwing more fridge magnets on the door

is this because of so many most what doing here is taking the output of the perl splitting it into chunks wherever there are tabs or and taking those chunks as arguments to the first chunk which is the command to in really extremely simplistic cases like it might but just a really bad representation of what really doing cannot do quoting or use any other shell features like parameter bash but bash a temporary file to put your perl output into and then running that with bash but inconvenient as you need to create clean your temporary file and have it in a portably writable remember not to use or to execute the temporary file unless you really intend to run it all in the active when you use or you be able to reliably clean up your temporary file the best is pretty safe in the context least assuming your perl script outputs correct bash of that do pretty much the same

key thing to realize here is that you have to use just you can use two one you already have which is drawn on hidden map which drawn but which is used for path collision detection natural next question then is where does this second map come you create your own tool which can load your first and display your tool will then let you draw boundaries around you islands and place markers at your these markers and boundaries polygons are stored as your second map and is used in your code to do path finding fact you can have your tool emit python code which creates the graphs and polygons so that you have to load any data am just basically telling you to make a level it very hard to you just need some buttons to click on to define what you are if you are adding a then you can just add each mouse coordinate to an array each time you click on your mouse if you have toggled your add polygon you can have another button for adding cities so that each time you click on the map you will record that coordinate for the city and possibly a corresponding name that you can provide in a text

know but as for lucene vs a database i think that lucene performance is you should be able to do almost search in less than 10 no matter how many records you have to provided that you have set up your lucene index comes the biggest hurdle i think integrating lucene in your project is not it is not too hard to set it up so you can do some basic but if you want to get the most out of with optimal then you definitely need a good book about for cpu ram performing a search in lucene task your cpu too though indexing your data although you do that too often once or twice a so that much of a answer all of your questions but in if you have a lot of data to and you want great then i think lucene is definitely the way to if not going to have that much data to then you might as well go for a database setting up a mysql search is definitely easier in my

know this a perfect but in linq why not do the join ef work because the file returns when doing the is case result from t1 in t2 in on equals i but linq to entities is still in its infancy and the object classes that are designed are designed for specific reasons that do not handle exceptional cases in a design such as alternative is that you can create your own code generator using t4 since everything is a public partial class you can create a navigation property that actually does the case insensitive comparisson that you are looking answer your question truthfully there is no of the way to get ef to do a navigation using case insensitive

learning ruby in my spare and i have a question about language constructs for does ruby have an equivalent of the const keyword to keep variables from being some example like to declare to be because i use it below in my program and i really want to modify it by does ruby provide a language construct for doing or should i just suck it up and realize that my variables are always to most likely cause of overwriting of variables long blocks of i agree with the spirit of your but disagree with the your point about avoiding long blocks of code and unnecessary state is a good but for constants can also be useful in describing the design of code inside of the a large part of the value of const in my code comes from annotating which variables i should change and which i so that not tempted to change them if i come back to my code next this is the same sentiment that suggests that code that uses short comments because of good variable names and clear indentation is better than awkwardly written code explained by detailed option appears to be which i like the look of as thanks for the responses equivalent of

like a job for i have pulled the trigger so reduces to a search when the weights are so this too oh mentioned by may be ideal for the idea is that instead of searching and recursing in whatever order the elements are in each level of the tree on your or you use some heuristic to determine which element you are going to try in your case a good bet would probably be the degree of a node of but you could possibly want to use the number of people within some arbitrary number of degrees of a given person the guy who has has three friends who each have 100 friends is likely to be a better node than the guy who has 20 friends in a clique that shuns all sorts of other things you could use as a heuristic get 2 get 1 this with a depth limit off after 6 degrees of or and you can vastly improve your average case case is still the same as basic

like access restriction benefits the programmer more than it assists with actually optimize for as many situations involving const as one might for many reasons as mutable data the most relevant reason here though is just because a allow modifying the data it refers mean that that data be changed via other and if the compiler determine that the data is then it really optimize much more than it would for the iterator info and examples can be found

made some research a while specific question from might give you some additional you use nhibernate for a project with a legacy which is partly out of your of your points of interest i can is better if you control both the data model and the can answer it the other way if you have control over the data model and thus facing some legacy ibatis is the better is repeatedly called simpler to learn does this have maintenance consequences easy to hard to depends what you want to do with if you have a domain driven development approach then ibatis might get painful by if you just do simple data manipulation and have a full blown domain model then nhibernate might be a overkill by the both make it easy to switch the underlying database have mechanisms to shield you off from a specific database but i admit that have not done intense research in this skilled do your developers need to be with you use you need more sql skills than using ibatis you always need to code some nhibernate require you to code sql statements it even can do the ddls for powerful features will require you to go to old good which will be other personally find that ibatis much more you can get things done very nhibernate is more but has much more which you can use in wrong is possible to combine the use of nhibernate and you can use nhibernate for your business for reporting where you just read data out of fallback to your application has a longer life cycle and a lot of business consider it has a lot of feature aiding you in handle business community around nhibernate is very active and come up with useful

managers see the advantages of unit testing until they see it in action where it makes so my based on is to take the ff unit tests to recurring this is the best use case to prove the value of unit when you have bugs that just appear and reappear every other the unit test will allow developers to see which changes caused the aside from alerting them in advance that a fix is in quite easy to demonstrate to management as unit tests to regular with the usefulness of unit tests now clearly several instances of recurring bugs disappearing in the long term should be enough to encourage everyone to use unit tests to evaluate to prevent them from becoming recurring unit tests to new with unit tests making sure that old bugs and confirm that they are fixed in the first the next step would be to apply it to new functionality to ensure that bugs will be make it clear that it is impossible to totally eliminate full blown the final step will be to apply unit testing even before as a design tool that both helps in designing code and minimizing course not saying that this is easy what i had stated above is an oversimplification which even i struggle with everyday difficult to convince later you decide to move on to a different you may want to explicitly look for a company that practices

might be missing something but i will take a crack at this you have to create the control hierarchy the same as it was on the inital rendering for you ids to match and allow your events to fire it sounds like you need to do some reordering after an event fires so you will need to create the controls need to be able to recreate your controls and the control hierarchy on post you should send enough information to the client so that you can recreate the controls correctly on this can be done by saving information in viewstate if should only recompute the control inforation when it is in your case because of some post back basic flow should be like in you load if you have the viewstate needed to create your call your populate otherwise create them from when a post back the load event will create but they are being reconstructed from viewstate so this should be when the post back event call you populate method to recreate the controls in the new order or with the new depending on what event i am building a control i like to think about how the control will behave if a post back occurs from some other control on the your control should continue to look the same unless affected by that post back and it should be able to be recreated without doing any data but from information it has collected on previous edited my answer and hopefully this is a littler clearer

my comp sci degree first of all you have to ask yourself the what type of search do you want to offer the if the user will clearly know what they are looking for example a product based website then you should provide a search engine based on for example users will be searching for a specific or product this is generally quite easy to next is your familiar web search engine such as google here targets a completely different the typical user know exactly what they are looking they just know that they are looking for something to do with aeroplanes for now google has to try and figure out what is the result that is most likely to match that and be the most know google has an incredibly complex and optimised system but from memory if you want to go this way you need to create something called an inverted index then you need to start thinking about a thesaurus because what if the user types in then you should also provide results that contain the word also word because the user typed in cat the cats result will also be am pretty sure that if you are providing a search engine for your website then it most likely be a metadata search engine in which case you can roll your own if not and you are looking for the second type then why not use they provide a custom search that will work within your own

not consider ethics for a consider the you are proposing to do is see section clause 12 of the order of allocation of nonstatic members separated by an is if you have a class with private and a struct with no private the standard does not guarantee that the members will be in the same if your hack it works only by that the compiler writers happened to do it that there is no guarantee that it will work on another a later version of the same or with different class to mention if you have authority to modify the class to provide a simple accessor you probably have authority to object if any implementation detail in the class of the ideas behind public and private is to distinguish what is promised from what is freely the layout may or the member might come to mean something or be removed sutter wrote guru of the column on this as far as the ethics if you really have to do something like and you get out of document it very if your coding standards have some sort of procedure to flag nonstandard use if be very careful to note it in a way it be overlooked when something goes

others have already pointed out when you do a select distinct over your end up with a full table scan no matter really a matter of limiting the number of rows that need to be question what do you need your distinct typenames and how many of your 200m rows are do you have only a handful few hundred at distinct so you could have a separate table or something and fill those initially by doing a full table and then on inserting new rows to the main just always check whether their typename is already in and if add have a small table with just the distinct typename which would be lightning fast to query to

others have the number of tables is probably indicative of a bad but it is far from a slam dunk that it is the source of the performance best advice i can give you for any performance optimization is stop guessing about the source of the problem and go look for above all start optimizing until you have positively identified the source of the start by some on the database and identify the poor performing this would also tell you which tables are getting used the most by the in all likelihood a large number of those tables are probably leftover temp no longer or working tables someone clean

reading your question it sounds like your ui collects the information and then uses the factory to create the appropriate we use a different approach in the application i startup my applications uses the factory method to create a master list of of my labels have initialization parameters because they are variants of each for example we have three type of flat part while others have parameters that are user defined or not known at the first case the initialization is handled within the factory so i create three instances of flatpartlabel passing in the needed the second case label interface has a configure this is called by the label printer dialog to populate a setup in your case this is where the tracking reference and customtext would be passed label interface also returns a unique id for each label if i had a specific command to deal with that type of label then i would traverse the list of labels in my application find which one matches the cast it to the specific type of and then configure we do this when user want to print one label only for a specific flat this means you can be arbitrary complex in the parameters your labels need and not burden your factory with unessential

recently started looking into the new policy management in sql server 2008 and when i checked for compliance with the not granted server my server failed the the reason and i am pretty sure this is the public has tcp endpoint permission so that users can connect to the if i were to remove i would have to assign users individually the right to seems silly to i cannot figure out why microsoft would recommend changing i have no guest so only specified users can access the the server is behind a and only one subnet in the company can even access does anyone have any insight on 2008 not granted server

seem like the approach your looking but what i i 2 i think if you have an odd number of characters the substring will probably probably have to add a check and use something like 2 0 2 but i to me the difficulty here is that your reduce actually depends on the array index rather than the hence my solution of enumerating the array indexes and working from another solution would be to provide a method think of one built that enumerates the characters in the string using a tuple that contains the index and the

so that for your cpu you only use this type of assembly to to your languages eventually convert to instructions that are executed on real whether that is done fairly directly as with an assembler or through a high level of abstraction as with the tricky bit is actually getting the machine instructions to manipulate the hardware in ways that you want since one point of higher level languages is to shield you from the hardware like are designed with the intent to manipulate hardware directly and so they include keywords like volatile to prevent the compiler from otherwise optimizing away references to device these may be written and not read back so that the compiler thinks the value saved is never used or it may be necessary to read a device register though the value is never there are also miscellaneous instructions for such operations as enabling and disabling interrupts that an ordinary program will not may also require linker support so that memory locations memory mapped can be located at the correct addresses for device however some processors use distinct instructions for and there must be some facility for inserting them in the code so in many cases it may not be possible to access unless there is explicit language with most modern operating systems like windows and applications are run in virtual memory where program addresses do not match physical address and the programs are usually denied access to the code that tries to access hardware when the os has not granted it specific permissions will generate an return to the os and no longer	
so working on an application that was previously hosted on a windows 2000 and now i have to move it to windows the application needs the ability to switch its user account from to a restricted and reboots in a wrapper this works fine in windows when i try it windows i get access denied errors when i try to remove the account from the restricted account and add it to the administrator it works the other way anyone know where the permissions need to be modified in order to be able to allow the restricted account to groups from user it seems to be handled differently between windows 2000 and windows user group modifications via	
socket file should be created automatically when the mysql daemon it most likely the directory which is supposed to contain it or some other file system problem is preventing the socket from being find out where the file should mysqld grep	
socket you create a listening socket and then for each client that you get a normal stream socket that you can use to handle the the os manages the queue of incoming connections behind the processes cannot bind to the same port at the same time by wondering if a way any especially to launch multiple instances of a such that they all bind to the and so they effectively share the each process instance could then be single it would just block when accepting a new when a client one of the idle process instances would accept that would allow each process to have a very sharing nothing unless through explicit shared and the user would be able to adjust the processing bandwidth by starting more such a feature for those asking not use obviously threads are an but with multiple threads in a single all objects are shareable and great care has to be taken to ensure that objects are either not or are only visible to one thread at a or are absolutely and most popular languages and runtimes lack support for managing this starting a handful of identical worker you would get a concurrent system in which the is no making it much easier to build a correct and scalable there a way for multiple processes to share a listening

solution far right that the executionmode is what you want to use when wanting something to come out in the start or end mode of the which is part of what you then you say you want that script tag put out in the start mode of only the first tag used on the where you would use suggestion of the request unlike the default the request scope is shared among all custom tags on a given you proposed using the caller and that could unless the caller was another custom in which case the caller scope would only be the local scope in the custom the request scope has been around since about cf is your best that your proposed solution was in the custom in the start programatically check if you have already created a tracking variable in the request scope when you put the script tag out the first if put out the script tag and create the tracking than changing your code from using caller to also suggest want to put the cfset inside the no need to execute it again for when the if test

specify the it specifies the in time required as the underlying data gets the constants are dropped from the what this means is that can be less than for some really small web service is a way to connect to some besides the network the real time is bound by what the service is actually there could be a database underneath for if it is something that just returns an the computational time is mostly the request is bounded by the database needs to parse the build a query optimized then apply some search algorithms against a series of caches and if you just plopped an integer into a trivial or a tableless sql then fetching the data is probably its the whole transactional packaging that will eat you get a packet back and forth to a server before you can parse trivial sql and punch back a tabled these days i say it was a toss some networks are faster than while some databases and servers are pretty nothing is is a web service faster than a if and only if the service is trivial hiding a then obviously just additional databases are big bulky and while gotten much faster over the their base level of transactional integrity specifies an awful lot of minimum cpu slower because they are doing so much more contrast that with some explicit minimal computation hidden behind network a fibber or gigabit network can rapidly move just so much less work to get course the reason we replace databases with custom written web services is it takes too long to write and then keep it up to way more effort than just slamming it into a database and accepting w

the great majority of you will only be returning a single result set with any given call so it would not make sense for the designers to have required a every time you use a your second example does indeed hold you are pulling multiple result the other thing that your post makes me is why be doing the same things with the if you are retrieving multiple result sets the structure of the data be different enough that you be doing the exact same your example makes me wonder if you have some kind of bug in your thinking about how the data management functions	
the guy who was here a while back about controlling windows media player via made but hit a vexing so back looking for followed the advice i got last time and installed i execute these lines out of a test wmp new and wmp pops playing i got this one that when i interact with this object after its it seem to have anything to do with the wmp instance when i execute this wmpsettings i get an output seems innocuous except volume of has nothing to where the player volume set volume of the player change after tried other properties as but the same the value of the properties seem to be related to what the player is actually and while changing them seems to alter the state of the being it has no affect on the actual get the exact same output each time i run the so whatever it is altering when i twiddle it have any persistence outside of the doing something but fumbling around blindly trying to figure out can anybody offer me any insight into going or what i ought to be trying not even certain is the right input i experimented with entries in in the registry until i found this thanks in advance for any help anybody can i found a package in the offerings from a company called ez it failed in ways so identical to what i was seeing before that either just a wrapper for or the wmp interface is plain why did i say chatted with customer and they wound up demonstrating how you can be helpful without actually being they helped me correct the sample code they provided as an example of their wmp code in but when i pestered them for some insight into how the volume methods are supposed to i got but there is no wmp expertise available here ez jcom is just a bridge builder between java and other programs like in mind the package of theirs i was evaluating is actually called had i gotten it to i would have had to talk my boss into for the one wonders what charge if they actually had some expertise on their own no real just thought still poking at my current operating theory is that in order to get at the volume need to access wmp seen mention of the iwmpremotemediaservices and iserviceprovider with the queryservice method of the latter providing a pointer to the not having any luck figuring out how to get a hold of seen mention that accessible from the windows but i figure out how to get a hold of that since the word figures pretty heavily into google is giving me a hellacious if anybody has any advice on how i lay hands on the com object representing love to hear this is on an xp my research is suggesting that merely talking to the wmp object is you need to wrap it more tightly than that so it can talk a wmp sdk with a lot of but it appears to rely on microsoft visual extensions to the code that i have and not giving away for i done in twelve i know possible with but if going outside of need the solution to be a standalone executable and installed on the relevant per answer i dug the constants out of and tried the following which makes use of the int int findwindow new wmphandle media window sendmessage new playresult 0 catch pauseresult 0 gives me a result window but actually affect the media also tried it with which gives different return values but do anything i really need to get the individual commands to work for this to be a viable simply toggling the state blindly help me since i know what state the player is in when i anybody have any advice on what doing wrong or what else i might media player ignoring	
the have three page that contains a user control and a control which is in the user the user control has a handful of events that the page listens to which change what the control server control essentially creates a looking list filled with many many smaller controls that need to have all of these controls are created dynamically side populating this server side control requires operations that are intensive in nature and should therefore be only done once per event1 and event2 fire and basically will change things about the serverside controls rendering filtering so when they fire i need to call populatecontrols for the i cannot find the best place to put the call to if i put it in the it fires and draws the list before any then my events have to call populatecontrols themselves to respond to the if i put the call in the events do not fire because from what i they need to be created before or during where do i put this call so that i only have to call it once and so that it can respond to the proper some psuedo class mypage protected usercontrol wire up event public public private do intensive operation to populate protected protected control events and page life	
the i have a local git repository that mirrors the contents of another source control system proprietary written a script that periodically syncs my git branch with that latest copy of the same branch by another term in the other system but conceptually suppose that in the other someone creates a branch from the branch currently syncing and starts hacking on what like to do is pull down the first version of that other then find the commit in my git version of the main branch that is closest to the new if i can do know which commit from the main branch to make as the parent of this new sounds to me like a problem of computing but as sha1 hashes have a distance is there another way to do this besides the obvious manual deep search on each commit to find out which one has the most number of similar see found a way to do do i find the tree that is closest to another	
the ideal a http post submit that causes a database update would redirect after successful update to a secondary page which informs the user about the success of the if the user tries to go back to the previous the browser would prompt the user with a message similar to page cannot be refreshed without resending the click retry to the information or click cancel to this should suffice as user intimation that refreshing the page will entail duplicate if the update the same page would load and allow the user to this is not a hard and fast rule and implementations i would greatly recommend taking suggestion into practice your database insertion code should always check duplicacy before applying an	
the implementation of http opening in urllib2 has no callbacks when read is the ootb opener for the http protocol is which uses to do the actual reading via a you could write your own subclasses of httpresponse and and install it as the default opener into urllib2 using this would be but not excruciatingly so if you basically copy and paste the current httpresponse implementation from the standard library and tweak the method in there to perform some processing or callback when reading from the socket

there extra overhead in using the the method directly contains the minimal il description to perform the reference equality check the equivalent to and will often be inlined by the when targeting so i personally think that is potentially more readable in the negated because it explicitly expresses its the cast to may be confusing to some just found discussing it prefers because the il footprint is it argues that this might facilitate inlining of method using this however any detailed knowledge of the jit but logically and i believe this is if the jit behaves anything like an optimizing it will consider the method inlining the call to so the sake of inlining method the memory footprint will be exactly the same either is to choosing one way over the other will have no impact whatsoever on the jit and consequently on	
there is a concurrency risk when you modify a static variable in static static functions themselves have distinct sets of local but any static variables are your specific samples not being but just because using constants assigning the same values to change the code sample slightly and be you call and from different threads in no way to guarantee the value of a and b in this c a static int a static int int b a int c a return static int int b int c a return can also achieve concurrency problems with multiple invocations a single like static int a int b int c a int d a a may have changed return c issue here is that the value of a may change due to other invocations changing

there something that be accomplished without they are absolutely equivalent to defining the class normally at top and then copying a reference to it into the outer think any special reason nested classes are other than it makes no particular sense to explicitly them looking for a class that exists within the lifecycle of the and always has a reference to an instance of the outer classes as java does nested classes are not that but you can hack up something that for making inner adds a property to the inner pointing to the owner use a weakref dict to memoise previous results so always returns the same inner def not consider adding a def if instance is return if instance not in return using an inner class def return inner object of inner object of object at uses class which are new in python and otherwise have to say after the class

thing to remember is that at core visual like any is a glorified text editor with an integrated and maybe a few other features as you could certainly use visual studio 2005 to input the code text of your linq program and then use the command line compiler to build you might even be able to find or write an to automate the build means the technically correct answer to your question you get extra ide syntax to work with solution debugger result is that you would probably be better served if i had simply you already have 2005 but not you have a few the 2008 express a tool like a 2008 full

think in this case you do want to use because you want to close those disagree with the notion that you should have two try blocks in the same think the flaw in the design is acquiring the connection and performing the query in the same i would recommend separating the a service class or method knows about the unit of it should acquire the pass it to another class that performs the and closes the connection when that way the query method can throw any exception it encounters and leave the cleanup to the class or method responsible for the

think that there is an automatic way of doing but you could always use to traverse the visual tree of your silverlight and pick out the value of any controls that interest it be easier to just bind the controls to properties on a viewmodel you could add a method to the class that would then build the post request for based on the properties that it is

think there is a point where you must draw a line and make a see no way to completely decouple logging from the system because you have to send those messages somewhere and in a way that someone would go with the default logging the default well documented and comes with the default so no dependency issues you save yourself from reinventing the if you are really into doing something you could make a global reporter you can instantiate and configure it at the beginning of your process no redirecting even in a per and call it from no need to pass it around in a multi threaded but that would be can also put it inside another thread and catch log events a la

think this depends on the application your if building a cms and the usage of the data is going be to display images within a web it might make sense to save the images to disk as opposed to being put into the although honestly i would do which could allow adding a server to a farm without having to copy files all over the use case might be a complex such as a or even a business object with lots of you could serialize both of these into a binary or text based and save them in the then you get the benefit of the think people should be using queries in the first what you do is provide two ways to get the one methods returns the summary the second would return the i imagine why you would need to return thousands of images all at

think this very simple method should help you understand the method will call itself until a certain condition is true and then anumber anumber 0 anumber 1 function will print out all numbers from the first number feed it till 10 wil 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 then stop because anumber is no longer larger then bassicly happens is that will write 10 and then call which will write 9 and then call until writes 1 and then calls which will write 0 butt will not call code is essiantially the same why use recursion you might if a does essentially the well you mostly use recursion when you would have to nest for loops but know how deep their for example when printing out iemts from nested nestedarray a a string nested in an a string even the last stringorarray stringorarray stringorarray stringorarray will a a string nested in an a string even the last function could take an array which could be nested into a 100 while you writing a for loop would then require you to nest it 100 would be enough for the nestedaaray we have but you would nest the for loops even more if you would nest the array another for typeod for typeod for you can see the recursive method is a lot

think you need a domain model similar to the buyer details seller details book details it works is that a user or can create a bid or offer as so if you are a buyer you may start by searching through the offers if you like one you may choose to accept it and proceed to perhaps you quite like any of the offers but one is close in price to what you you might create a bid and have that sent to the creator of the offer to if nothing is close to your requirements as a buyer you may create a bid and leave it in the system for potential sellers to and consider till time of expiry you have have added the bid and offer classes and i think their benefit is self but if you would like some further explanation please feel free to leave a comment and i will the expiry fields are not necessary but most likely every bid and offer will have a time limit in which case you will need have increased the number of but i think you will find that your system becomes much easier to manage and

to remember about transaction replication is that a single update now requires several operations to happen for that change to you update the source the log readers sees the change and writes the change to the distribution the distribution agent sees the new entry in the distribution database and reads that then runs the correct stored procedure on the subscriber to update the you monitor the statement run times on the two servers probably see that they are running in just a few however it is the lag time while waiting for the log reader and distribution agent to see that they need to do something which is going to kill you truly need sub second processing time then you will want to look into writing your own processing engine to handle data moving from one server to i would recommend using sql service broker to handle this as this way everything is native to sql server and no third party code has to be

turns out to be a pretty deep area of but the basic outline is a hash function is just a function that takes things from one space strings of arbitrary and maps them to a space useful for indexing you only have a small space of things to you might get away with just interpreting those things as and done 4 byte got a much larger if the space of things you allow as keys is bigger than the space of things you are using to index or then you possibly have a unique value for each when two or more things hash to the same have to handle the redundancy in an appropriate way is usually referred to as a and how you handle it or will depend a bit on what you are using the hash implies you want it to be unlikely to have the same and you probably also would really like the hash function to be these two properties a few has kept many people practice you usually should be able to find a function that is known to work well for your application and use to make this work as a imagine you care about memory then you can create an array as long as your indexing set for as you add something to the you hash key and look at the array at that if there is nothing you put your value if there is already something you add this new entry to a list of things at that along with enough information original or something to find which entry actually belongs to which as you go a every entry in your hashtable is either or contains one or a list of retrieving is a simple as indexing into the and either returning the or walking the list of values and returning the right course in practice you typically do it wastes too much so you do everything based on a sparse array the only entries are the ones you actually everything else is implicitly are lots of schemes and tricks to make this work but the

usb devices contain a unique serial number is actually a unicode which the host can use in conjunction with the vendor and product id numbers to uniquely identify the trying to figure out how to write a windows application that would be able to display a list of all usb human interface devices attached to the the list would have one row for each including system there would be columns in the list for the vendor product and serial can get a list of usb hids by calling with the guid returned by and looping through the result by repeatedly calling i can then call to get the path to each which i can open with so long as i am careful to request neither read nor write which would be denied for a system from there i can get the vendor and product id numbers by invoking having trouble figuring out is how to retrieve the serial number when i search for solutions to this i find a lot of information about how to get serial numbers for usb mass storage but nothing that looks like it might apply to any other type of usb i would be happy to discover either a generic method or a method of retrieving the serial number have a feeling that the win32 port of could manage this without too much but unfortunately i need a solution that depends only on libraries that come with such as the and dlls that contain the functions mentioned suggestions would be very much the serial number of a usb keyboard under

way applets work in netbeans is annoying to the suggested usage from the help is to run the applet as you indicate you did netbeans will produce an html file under that references the you then copy the html file to src where your class you can then tweak the html and in subsequent runs netbeans will use your html file instead of generating every time you run the file netbeans opens the applet viewer program that ships with you cannot control any of the arguments passed to the applet it ignores the parameters you configure in the to change the parameters passed to the applet you must edit the html file better way is to use the appletwindow classes created over at the bluej it lets you host an applet on a which means you can make a small standalone swing app which calls your the program then has a main you can launch an extra swing window with buttons and text controls to simulate javascript calls to the applet and you can tweak the attributes that get passed to the applet at very nice for trying out new things in your this jar contains the compiled files and the info about bluej and other

when hired on to my current company a year i was tasked with migrating our development teams from they already had it in their minds that they wanted and since i had experience using and setting up i was a good i first tried to sell tfs because it woul dhave solved the problem i am in right but since money is and subversion is well you get i have finalized the propsal and the only thing standing in the way is the proposed that we store only our source code in and all release and other project artifracts be stored in our sharepoint so we have to give non developer stakeholders access to when i presented the all was excepted but the question arose about how to manage the syncronization between the artifacts how to is document x version associated with release my initial reaction is to create a section in the sharepoint porject page for each new release that will hold the artificats keep track of changes is there a better way of doing does anyone know of anyone doing or any integration packages to sync svn with is some info on the companies development all of our software is for internal we sell none of so our customers are all we have 2 types of those who take care of maintainance and customization of third party and those who write proprieatry software is where i our software we write is mostly but the 3rd party software is all over the board other crap that no ones cares about as i need to get this submitted i hate and i need management with subversion and sharepoint

when using a dynamic the utility will not be able to give you the exact binaries these days use what is known as relocatable these addresses change when they are mapped to the address the xlinker i am able to get a large memory map with a lot of things i linker map will usually have all symbols the standard runtime hooks there any way to get a list of locations for all the headers are a good place to when the linking is does it link just the functions that the executable or is it all functions in the does not necessarily mean that all symbols will be resolved given an it depends on the type of binary you are compilers like gcc does allow you whether to create a binary or gcc you may check out exp dlltool check with the appropriate

where it gets the text states the balance factor of r is it means the insertion occurred on the right side of that node and a left rotation is but from m understanding the text said i that if the balance factor was within then there was no need for epiphany what a rotation think about a left p o ourself element rc right lc left child the right not of 18 what happens our right child moves into our we become the left child of our right our right left child becomes our the big thing you have to notice here this left rotation has not changed the depth of the no more balanced for having done and the magic in avl if we rotated the right child to the right what have is now if we rotate o what we get is o managed to get rid of a level of the tree made the tree the tree means getting rid of excess and packing the upper levels more completely which is exactly what just whole stuff about rotations is simply that you have to have your subtree looking like you rotate and you may have to do a right rotate to get into that but if already in that you only need to do the left

will try and address compilation perf later this just not something focused on or profiled instead focusing on runtime be very interested to hear about your thinking of doing a drools pacman game to start to explore about how best to use rule engines for as games are often about events and checking relations between objects it seems that a properly tune rule engine could provide some the later the will become important as in many cases the engine could be far more efficient in partial matches if it knows about the problem space up ideally with games this is often the so we can provide hints to the engine to tailor it in places to those use have some current research going on for adding that should also be interesting for please do contact me if you made any mproctor at redhat d0t

worked a lot with hibernate as my jpa in most cases it works but i have also seen a lot of with persisted objects is because hibernate replaces the java collections with its own collection so the every client must have the hibernate you have to take care on lazyloading exceptions one way to get around this problem is the use of checking is done against the database without any causes that the data access acid updates so we know if an object is modified or not causes there similar issues with eclipse link and when should i use have they a similar are there reasons to choose eclipse over and practical eclipse ibatis

working on a server application for a game engine writing in actionscript using an authoritative server model as to prevent cheating and ensure fair so everything works the client begins it tells the server and starts rendering the tells everyone else that client x has began among with details so they can also begin when the client stops it tells the which performs calculations based on the time the client began moving and the client render tick delay and replies to so they can update with the correct thing when i use the default 20ms tick delay on server when the client moves for a rather long a noticable tilt forward when it if i increase slightly the delay to on my local network everything runs very but in other the tilt is still after experimenting a i noticed that the extra delay needed is pretty much tied to the latency between client and i even boiled it down to a formula that would work quite delay 20 how would i procceed to obtain the latency between a certain client and the server using asynchronous the cpu effort be too as to not have the server run is this really the best or is there a more way to do do i obtain the latency between server and client in

would be the best way to reorganize the project and refactor the code so that it retains its current ability to access everything think actually quite close and probably better than many python projects where they just assume that there is only one instance of the and store values in a module global or is ok for many simple but really nicest to be able to bundle everything up into one application object that owns all inner classes and methods that need to know the first thing i would do from the looks of the code above would be to factor out any of those modules and classes that a core competency of your things that necessarily need access to the names like and sound suspiciously like much of their contents really specific to your they could perhaps be refactored out into separate standalone or submodules of your package that only have static stuff not relying on application i would put the main owner application class in the rather than a then from your or just the you can get a complete instance of the application as simply could also consider moving any basic deployment settings from the settings class into the you only have one possible set of settings and every time you instantiate you get the same little use in having all this ability to encapsulate your whole you might as well simply be using module doing with some of my apps is making the owned classes themselves into actual members of the owner application def def def possible to change or configure the application from outside it by the inner class def send called actually return not that worried about internal data this is python not we worry too much about evil programmers using properties and methods they we just put at the start of the name and let that be a suitable warning to those long chains slow the code down as really readability is the important anything else is premature	
would break this into 2 you write scalable certainly possible to create the low level constructs needed in order to achieve you want to write but if i was going for a highly concurrent i would choose a language that was either designed to fill that void or easily lent itself to doing so and possibly was not designed to build highly concurrent but it can certainly be tweaked into doing the cost might be higher than you expect though once you factor in memory

would like to create a web are when a request would result in refreshing the content in or sometimes even more the cleanest way would be to run the requests one after the other in a sequence and handle the results one by i would like to have only one request if it is and collecting all the results for the there is a main container and some other containers simple way would main function from server for show it in m container some other content from server dedicated for show it in some other content from server dedicated for show it in some other content from server dedicated for show it in on the main function requested by the just some of the containers have to refresh not all of would like to minimise the number of actually minimise it to of it could be done by or would like to collect all the responses from the encapsulate them is content for content for and send it back to the where the client would unpack and regarding to the it would delegate each of them to the appropriate question that how would you do when you that the returned data is very in some cases it might contain even html double if i am not in some special cases this could screw up json and xml as idea was to divide the different contents by special separators now just for an easy example use and it is a very uggly but you cannot screw up the content for if the separators are unique previous solution would look like is content for content for on the client side split the code first by which would result in this case in two array elements what are going to be split again by the first element would give the the second one the content for after this the last step would be walking through the new and display the result in the appropriate there anybody who would suggest a nicer way for or who could show a safe way to do it in or for several

would really only make sense when you have a model hierarchy where the view is showing the common properties of the various child this could work but as a practical matter i see this happen very in my code the only place that i approach something like this is with a contact i have a user model that has a self contact and an emergency both contacts are of the same type with the differentiator being whether the relationship is or something i have a single view for creating these contacts and that view is rendered by 2 different actions on the same controller createcontactinformation and even this both use the same model i could have chosen to subclass the but there really enough of a distinction to warrant that the general case i would say that a view is used by a single controller and each controller deals with a single primary ancillary models to the primary may be handled by the primary controller or have their own depending on how you want to structure the

would say just completely remove your delegate delegate is doing exactly the same thing as the you are pretty much writing your own event plumbing instead of using the event an event is pretty much exactly what except that easier to and also makes it easier to unsubscribe from the is no advantage to providing both the event does everything that your and is much more developing this as a class i would suggest just making your class not be and following the more standard the normal approach for allowing logic to be overridden or inserted into your code and allowing events would be to provide hooks for could be used in a situation like this to allow the user to plug in their own in many having protected virtual functions makes this more and much easier to should be exactly an event that notifies the user of some these should be hooks where the user attaches their instead of providing delegates and the base windows forms controls use a protected method and an event triggered by default allows a user to subclass your class and override the logic is probably why want as well as handle the one place where i would provide delegates is in rare cases where your class or method requires logic to be added by a in this you can either provide an abstract base or have a delegate that is passed in for that a good example of this is the method in where is useless without the predicate used for so passing in a delegate makes sense in this that there is no event associated with this really there to provide a different

would strongly suspect you have any control over the local filesystem it should so you specify that a file is	
would suggest using 16 digit identifiers that when printed or shown to customers are formatted in the format of but stored as numbers without the dashes in your reason for using this format is that it makes it easier for people reading out the number over to phone to read as they can do it in batches of 4 rather then trying to remember how much they have said you wish the first 4 digits can be used to identify the type of 1000 for 2000 for 3000 for 4000 for invoices second set can then by a identifier if you wish to keep that sort of information encoded in the number using a format of yymm so would be a customer entered in march then leaves you with 8 digits for the actual data would consider the use of letters in the identifiers to be a very bad idea for any system that deals with telephones as the differences in accents and understand is so varied that people are bound to get upset at trying to get their identifier recognised by someone who cannot understand their accent

would teach tham how to set ulimit so that core files can be i might also include information on basic signal numbers and what those might you might in addition give them an overview of ftp to move files off to where they are more comfortable as well the basics of cr lf i would explain to them the primary differences between unix and windows slashes are i would also consider setting up a samba share so that they can use the tools of their choice to edit them how to redirect output and how to use tee is probably something they might benefit the basics of file permissions is a explaining that ssh and telnet are available to access those remote boxes might help if telnet port is finally i would teach them that removing a file has no undo feature as windows might consider explaining ps as well as simple pipes and i would show them how to background processes and maybe kill process with kill tools such as and pstree might help them

writing to the 64 output be using many different memory if the bins are filled essentially at it means that sometimes have two bins that couls share the same cache not a big the core 2 l1 cache is that means get a problem only with the 9th cache with just 65 live memory references at any time associative is l2 cache is apparently associative so 12 that weird a so even if have collisions in chances are pretty good still not hitting main if you like the bins in instead of stroing each bin interleave for bin store chunks at offsets but store chunks at offset for bin store chunks at offsets this takes just a few bit shifts and but the result is that a pair of bins share 8 cache possible way to speed up your code in this case is especially in x64 get 16 registers x 128 and you can optimize the read to limit cache not sure if that will help a lot with the read though expect the core2 prefetcher to catch reading sequential integers is the most simple kind of access any prefetcher should optimize

wrote a sample program that does just it has a class that will go do some processor intensive then i specify the total number of threads i want to and the total number of times i want the work to the program will then equally divide the work between all the threads only one it just gets it and start them all ran this on a single proc vm since i could find a real computer with only 1 processor in it thread 5000 work units threads 5000 work units seems to show that on a one proc with lots of threads that are doing processor intensive windows is smart enough not to rapidly switch them back and and they take about the same amount of together as close as i could get to pushing enter at the same thread 5000 work units threads 5000 work units is the meat of the when you run 10 threads 1 they all seem to be scheduled the 10 threads each took longer there was an 11th thread while the other thread took almost twice its time it got of its work done in the first then did the other in the next is about scheduler is fair on a thread but not on a process if you make a lot of it you can leave the other processes that smart enought to make lots of threads high and or just do it right and us a thread pool interested in trying it for you can find my

wrote one mainly as an attempt to make more when you do the method is explained it is based on but rather than take a large number of small you take a small number of large can tell for that instruction a function is costing you some percent x of total execution more or since it appears on the stack on of about because is a key the call stack exists as long as the program is if a particular call instruction is on the stack of the then if that instruction could that of time would does not depend on how many times is or how long the function call so timers and counters are missing the and in a sense all instructions are call even if they only call sampler is based on the premise that it is better to know the address of instruction with precision that is what you are looking than to know the number with if you know that you could save roughly of time by recoding do you really care that you might be off by still going to want to fix the amount of time it actually saves be made any less or greater by your knowing x it is possible to drive samples off of a but frankly i found it just as useful to trigger an interrupt by the user pressing both shift keys as the same since 20 samples is generally and this way you can be sure to take samples at a relevant time not while waiting for user it was quite another way would be to only do the samples while the user holds down both shift keys something like did not concern me that the taking of samples might slow down the because the goal was not to measure but to locate the most costly after fixing the overall speedup is easy to main thing that the profiler provided was a ui so you could examine the results what comes out of the sampling phase is a collection of call stack where each sample is a list of addresses of where every instruction but the last is a call the ui was mainly what is called a has a current which is a particular to the left is displayed the call instructions immediately above that as culled from the stack if the focus instruction is a call then the instructions below it appear to the as culled from the on the focus instruction is displayed a which is the percent of stacks containing that similarly for each instruction on the left or the percent is broken down by the frequency of each such of the instruction was represented by line and the name of the function it was the user could easily explore the data by clicking any of the instructions to make it the new variation on this ui treated the butterfly as consisting of alternating layers of function call instructions and the functions containing that can give a little more clarity of time spent in each not so worth mentioning some properties of this is not an because if an instruction appears more than once on any given stack that still counts as only one sample containing it still remains true that the estimated time that would be saved by its removal is the

you are going to do anything in regards writing or designing one of the things you should always is write a irrespective of whatever methodology you are wether it is agile or many people who say that writing specs is so unagile and a monument to wasteful bureaucratic the simple fact is that they are misguided when they say that code is the clear fact is that a spec allows you to formulate your ideas and designs and its much easier to change a spec than it is to change a especially if you are working outside the confines of simple lob specs ensure you have a clearer understanding of what is required when you start been show time and time again that teams that use design better my if you hear anybody say the code is the that is plain and and is storing up huge maintainability problems for the an i have anything against the agile manifesto or light management process centric methods like used it in the past few years a number of it also seen good software down the where an agile focus would have saved but it is no panacea or silver

you have three it on the server and accept those i know from experience that things do go but depending on how and high priority the tasks doing it may be something you can live basically if you have to do try to do as little word integration as if just a mail merge then you will probably get away without any problems of the a but from except for simple these never do the job quite for example if talking about something that will generate pdfs from word documents on the it will never look the same as it does in of directly invoking use the to manipulate the documents even written stuff in vb6 that manipulates 2007 since all in documented xml you to use the 2007 but fast and but something like a mail merge have to do manually i so it may not be this solution is generally better for manipulating documents rather than replacing word api personal experience done the first and it worked well enough for our customer to i messed around with the second and was never and done the third with great success a fair bit of people do all sorts depending on cost suggest option 1 or 2 for a fast less or 3 for a more reliable

you the argument needs to include the in your you say what this is at but i strongly suspect it does not include the based on your sample uri for your edit the id should be in the path of the not in the with the default mvc route it make any but without knowing what your routes are i would say that you should stick closely to the uri format that you give in the install if you put a breakpoint in the and inspect the value of the action it still looks open the net panel of click the xhr and look at the actual uri generated by your make sure it is if the uri is not then look at your routes and make sure that this uri will be correctly routed to the right but me that in a plug for the ajax form i find that it makes this sort of thing very

you think about using for this is quite easy to index just what you and you can also think about writing your own parser for specific files format that are not managed natively by you should really think about such a solution since lucene offers quite an easy api to query the it is quite well documented and you can find a lot of resources about it on the as your problematic can interest a lot of people perhaps it can be a good start for an project to create a personal search this can be challenging interesting for a huge amount of people i i chose this going to write an application that does exactly what is probably using i expect the two main problems to be selecting what to index only in the wikipedia and to index compressed files without unpacking them completely index while as soon as i release it add a link thanks for all your

you verify that i got the question table represents vectors identified by the every vector has a dimension of something between 100 and but there is no order defined on the that is a vector from the table is actually a representative of equivalence you define the similarity of two equivalence classes as the minimum euclidian distance of the projections of any two representative of the equivalence classes to the subspace of the first 30 for projection to two represents the following equivalence class of projection of all representative of this equivalence class to the first two dimensions represents a equivalence class with 720 the projection to the first two dimensions yields 30 the distance of a and b is the square root of because this is the minimum distance of two vectors from the for example and yield this am i right with my understanding of the really naive algorithm for n vectors with m components each would have to calculate for each distance the algorithm would calculate the distances of projection for each so for 100 dimensions lower there are possible projection for a this requires to calculate about distances between projections and finding the minimum to find the distance of two and then repeat this n hope that i misunderstood you or made a else this sounds something between really challenging and not i thought about is ordering the vector components and trying to match using manhattan distance if possible may help to simplify the

your original code you this case attachvideo is being called on a video see in your code where the video objects are but assume the second piece of code doing the attachvideo is being called on the videobutton not the video i think the reference to the stream will as your this variable will be the which as far as i can tell have that value defined reference within the is not the same as the this reference outside of think the call to fadein might also work as i think the scope will be messed something that might i tested it at but hopefully get the idea of what trying new new this essentially fixes the scope the value of i is properly due to the property of not really happy with i think the code should probably be refactored so that you have a single object per with members like i think that would make things a lot cleaner as you have to constantly be referring to the	
your other i guess you want to learn a new language to get new my advice is that the language is not really what is important is the quality of its community but also existing code you can read and learn and the available in this i think the is not the best choice for web libraries and frameworks are not portable and not and coding style of code you can study varies a lot and may confuse you a c is my favorite would advise to just learn and try to really understand the concept of then move to other languages more adapted to the web or javascript comes to mind or even in the c has the best mix of power and simplicity in my but is a niche
