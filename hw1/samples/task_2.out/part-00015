a big fan of having my embedded code compile on both the target hardware and my own for when targeting an i included both an entry point that maps to reset on the 8086 hardware and a dos entry the hardware was designed so all io was memory i then conditionally compiled in a hardware simulator and conditionally changed the hardware memory locations to simulated hardware i were to work on a probably write an emulator approach is to create a test rig where all the inputs and outputs for the hardware are controlled through we use this a lot in factory time we built a simulator into the io that way the rest of the system could be tested by sending a few commands over can to put the hardware into simulated software could have a where the io is simulated in response to software	
a bit of digging it turns out that the textblock actually call tostring on whatever is passed to work around this you must use a converter to call a tostring for the rub templatebinding support you have to add the templatebinding to the datacontext and then use normal binding in the text property along with the the textblock markup custom class numbertypetostringconverter public object type object cultureinfo if throw new return public object type object cultureinfo methodinfo methodinfo if throw new targettype to convert back to a number must implement a parse return new value seems like a bit of a work around and be interested to hear if it has any adverse also if anyone is reading this and there is anything wrong with my converter please let me

a closer look at what facebook is you get a prompt if you click a link the but nothing when entering a new url in the address clicking a or navigating back in your that works for easy enough to simply add a event handler to every link on the and trigger your stylized confirmation from since these handlers will get called prior to the of any navigation events triggered from within the page you can pretty much do whatever you want in the handler save cancel the event record the intended destination and postpone it after they if you do need or want to respond to navigation events triggered have to use and the dialog is and you cancel the event the price we pay for all the scandalous idiots abusing such features back in the

a getter method is a better design choice for a class as it allows you to replace the getter method with something more complicated in the although this seems less likely to be needed for a const the cost is low and the possible benefits are an in an especially good idea to give both the getter and setter for a member same since in the future you can then actually change the the pair of foo void a public member variable that defines an for this class encapsulates a fancier type of const return does some internal void does some internal foo client code will need to be recompiled of but no syntax changes are this transformation works just as well for const in which only a getter is

a licensing scheme that i am aware of that is not easily i will not go into but as an in the java case if it is done in java then it can be decompiled can or any compiled but java is easier than for if it is done natively then you need native and the could be replaced with one that allows the example i know someone who decompiled the cl to figure out how they do name all they had was the and they were able to do it with a disassembler and a lot of bother with this type of it annoys honest users and moderately slows down those that want to copy a look at world of goo and their take on is a similar idea to what you are talking developers of world of goo found that their was pirated of the explain how that number could be contrast that to another game that shipped with drm and was pirated of the you are talking about legitimate businesses then they want to be in license compliance so ensuring that they are not copying is a if you are talking about people who would not buy the product to begin or just want to pay for you are not really going to alter the number of people that get your software you will only slow down the first person who gets it after that the cat is out of the	
a little ashamed for asking you been very for a long i have been fortunate enough as to make a living outside visual as i grown older there are things i would like to and to be very this site has inspired me and i realize that vs and windows development suck that after all was designed after and now java is copying back some features from the child and windows vista is the first decent version since windows came to to any user in the you may delete all the above crap and keep the you tutorial aimed to learn windows development coming from strong java very interested in windows manipulation is the actual the get the get foremost app resize it and in windows search api among other minor my interest after all is to integrate them with my java apps through jni or read many tutorials and links over the and i actually understand the api it grabbed a copy of and express and actually got some basic samples problem is i get the big picture of the whole architecture it is the classes have hundreds of and it not that clear to me who calls had this same opinion when i first look at the javadoc i know some basic common for instance something like that it turned out to be the very window but every single tutorial i read give that for granted if or what ever it was a very descriptive know exactly the difference between windows sdk and some other i i know them at some degree and by common but while reading the tutorials or the api i get tried to grab some but they are aimed for absolute 0 programmers using visual basic was the main reason i kept away from ms for so many years in first do understand managed unmanaged clr and related because they are so similar to the java platform that it is almost after all my rants and honest opinions about ms the best way to learn windows development for a non absolute beginner but absolute new to windows apis what would be a good development for hardcore java

a pointer again instead of a usually uses pointer arithmetic when they want to get a pointer to get a pointer while using an array you are calculating the pointer then getting the value at that memory then you have to use to get the address more typing and less clean say you need a pointer to the 512th byte in a buffer cleaner more efficient is cleaner pointer arithmetic as an pointers with and decrementing with is useful when iterating over each element in an array of it is cleaner than using a separate variable used to keep track of the can use pointer subtraction with pointer this can be useful in some cases to get the element before the one you are pointing it can be done with array subscripts but it looks really bad and especially to a python programmer where a negative subscript is given to index something from the end of the

addition to answer i totally like to suggest you consider defining the attribute map in this will make your program extremely flexible and will factor out a lot of code you even realize you an attribute can know what field it binds to on the what field it binds to in the a list of actions to execute when the attribute changes recalculate might apply to both strength and it this you have no code per attribute to write a class out to the db or display it on the you simply iterate over the attributes and use the information stored same thing can apply to attributes and skills would probably derive from the same base you go down this probably find yourself with a pretty serious text file to define attributes and but adding a new skill would be as easy 20 coordinates probably the best some adding a skill like this would require no code change it could all be done in data pretty and all the data is stored in a single skill object attached to a you of define actions the same weave you attempt to weave a basket from case weaving you have the case weaving you make a lame subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you make a decent subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you make an awesome subtract 10 create basket value improve skill weaving case weaving you made the basket of the subtract 10 create basket value this example is pretty you should be able to visualize how it would be done with absolutely no imagine how difficult it would be to do anything like that without code if your were actually member

am looking for a good way to keep a design document up to date with the latest are a small team game graphic project sales most of our projects last a couple of at the start of the project a design is made but we generally find ourselves making changes or new decisions throughout the most of these changes are so we want to keep our process like the changed design results in more time needed this is generally taken care so that part is at the moment we have no nice way of capturing the changes to the initial design document and this results in the initial design quickly being abandoned as a source while this is of course a waste of our documents are and the best way to track changes in those documents will probably be adding a changelist to the top of the document and making the changes in the text in parallel not really an option think as looked at requirements management but that looks way to the documents could be stored in subversion but i think that is a bit too low level to give insight in the anyone know a good way to track changes like these and keep the design document a valuable resource throughout the at the moment we mostly rely on changes to the original design being put in the that way they are at least related version control applicable in document changes to a design

answer describes how i eventually solved my note that while the answer by john dibling was this was not the final solution to my this is because the message is sent as the final message to the but this can be handled before the last message to the window has finished being see for example for an explanation of the is called with calls your your you call ends up calling dialogproc again with calls your call in your having called the object is no longer but you are still technically in the handler so you will probably crash when you eventually get back this means it is not really safe to assume that you can do in since the object may still be live in some other stack a window designed to allow any window to use the method from the atl cwindow you must call subclasswindow for this instance so that the window procedure finalmessagewindow public t the object wanting to receive the final message the t the object that wants to get the onfinalmessage called when the final window message for the window has been processed this is often a good time to delete the hwnd the window virtual void created the above note that it is derived from the atl cwindow class this allows me to use the onfinalmessage handler for this the onfinalmessage handler is different from the postncdestroy in mfc windows in that it is guaranteed to be called only after the final message handler on the stack has then use window subclassing to insert this window as the window procedure for my own roughly we implement the onfinalmessage handler for our delete

answer to this question depends on a number of backwards compatible do you need to including ie6 will decrease the capacity of pure much of your site is there are certain things in css that become hard if not impossible in variable width height content is a problem for you can use floats for this but if the sum of widths exceeds the width of the the tail end floats will fall down tables are more capable in this regard as they will squeeze columns where possible to make things fit and cells will never be split onto new centering you its trivial with tables and hard or impossible on compatibility and fixed or variable heights of the container and the in pure may also be referring to hover ie6 only supports the pseudo element on javascript is required for that browser for if what you need to do can be done fairly trivially with pure css then do if feel bad if you have to use tables despite all the fanatics they are jumping up and down in you want a relatively simple exmaple of this check out you do this html layout without using this is a conceptually simple layout problem that is trivial with tables and noone has yet posted a solution meeting the requirements with pure

appears to be your root aggregate what you build your repository each style has a specific subset of colors and sizes that are allowed for that each style should contain a list of colors and class public colors public sizes repository is then going to have a method to return all the each style has its own list of colors and so no need to hit the repository again to get when the user selects a specific style from a dropdown bound the style then you can just get the list of colors and sizes from the selected object and populate the other a user chooses a specific color and then i would assume that gets saved in a separate like a selectedstyle which only contains one color and size class public color color public size size

are a couple of good ways to try and determine unique none of them are exact is why different analytics will report different first is to use a create a cookie for the user for each time frame that you want to track so you could create one that expires in a day and one that expires in a you can then use both of those to track how many unique visitors you of course this is not perfect since people can clear or refuse but it is pretty other way is to track uniques using a combination of the ip address and user agent of the requesting this is probably slightly less accurate since if a company has a good it group lots of internal users will have the same user agent and since they are all coming from the same internal network could have the same ip you are interested in reading more about the different methods there is a great article about it

back some xml for presumably to update the model or the strength of wicket is that you have to worry about the rendered in you set up the controller to correctly modify the and wicket takes care of the separation is not in fact you can view or change and that can be seen as altering the what you generally have to do is directly manage the browser or wicket takes care of if you take care of making your changes in the java the ajax will call a method on your ajaxbehavior with an ajaxrequesttarget that method in methods called from you do whatever you need to updating models or and then you add to the target any view component that that has wicket takes care of updating the an taken from some code i but just to make explication the idea is dropdown where the options in the child change when the select option in the parent as in the series of the actual the model change is passed to the which decides for itself if it has and adds itself to the target if it then passes the target to its removed most of that to make a clearer the which just adds to itself an anonymous subclass of an elided for ajax work without new public void ajaxrequesttarget tell child to update its based on newly selected when the ajax is my owning is already note we could just type making explicit that calling on the enclosing class a inner class has a hidden ref now add the child to the wicket javascript will receive the new options and the child could also have hidden or or added behaviors like css or even swapped one panel for as long as for each changed component called so that the javascript can find added it to the that different types of ajax behavior have different callback so be sure overriding the right one an annotation so the compiler can complain if you got the name the basic wicket idea is that instead of sending raw data for the client to parse and act you update your model and and tell wicket to what by adding the chnaged components to the only reason i can think of to send straight xml would to be to feed it to let me know if your and i completely missed the

believe your problem is that you use blocking sockets and not you use blocking sockets and you send 1m of data the network stack can wait for all of the data to be placed in a if the buffers are full be blocked and your progress bar will wait for the whole 1m to be accepted into the this may take a while and your progress bar will be however you use whatever buffer size you use will not and you will need to do the waiting yourself with is the most portable in this way your progress bar will be updated fast and reflect the most accurate note that at the sender the progress bar is partially broken any way since the kernel will buffer some data and you will reach before the other side really received the the only way around this is if your protocol includes a reply on the amount of data received by the others second guessing the os and the network is mostly if you keep using blocking sockets pick a size that is large enough to include more data than a single packet so that you send too little data in a packet as this will reduce your throughput go with something like 4k to include at least two packets at a

best practice for a flex application is to create a utility class to manipulate instances of a class rather than to change the prototype of that for you might create a class with static functions that accept objects as the reason you want to follow this best practice is that flex uses the strict setting by and trying to access functions added to the prototype of a sealed class will throw compiler the turning off strict is not advisable because the compiler will not be able to optimize your code as well as it could under strict

best way to achieve this will be to write a window service that acts like a mail client or this windows service should execute a timed action triggered by a which connects to the mail server and polls the server for any unread available in the email the email id to check for is the email id on which the users will give their input if the windows service client finds that there exists any new then it should download and filter the email body and push further for processing based on the user input in the you can host the input processing in the same windows service but it is not advisable to do the windows service can put the inputs in a special application directory or database from where your main appication can read the user inputs received in email and process them as will be required to develop a high performance client for doing i advise you not to use the default library due to performance instead use one of the best availabel open source implementations for like from we have used this in our applications and achieved remarkably grear this

c programming is certainly a great book and a very good introduction to the c it has several is somewhat the 2nd edition last covers only c89 which is now 20 years while c99 current universally there are a number of features from it that are supported by many implementations and exposure to them is it cover many of the standard library functions in any detail and certain intricacies are not explored in text assumes you are already an experienced programmer and has a very terse style which work well for you are looking for a more or i would strongly recommend a modern 2nd it covers every aspect of the language and the standard library in including and is extremely while the list price is rather it usually difficult to find a copy for around

certainly tempting to begin by learning one of the popular i would advise against it as a first they are the easiest ones to find help but they are also the languages with the most idiosyncratic limitations and twists due to the way things evolved with industrial a lot of confusing and difficult to have a critic eye without the perspective of the more exotic languages are often cleaner and simpler to especially if you have ideas about the communities are but that also means they are more fun and i think better to learn the bases first with a very language and an interactive you could go through to design an excellent book which goes from simple math to advanced have a look at with or is probably not a bad idea to experiment with when you want to go to more popular there is and the web languages like html and c will be nice when you wonder how things really work with the reserve java and for when you need a they are not that fun anyways

controller convention is so routing can easily find the controller without additional adding the required controller ending makes it less likely that you would accidentally expose an object through mvc is a built in convention for views as by default views should be in a folder named for your controller and be named the same as the action calling this is what enables the method call in your action to work without specifying the i often find myself specifying the view but if you are looking for a convention this is definitely the one encouraged by the a model standpoint you are there is no standard the reason for this is because the mvc framework never directly touches the it needs a convention for the controllers to find them from and it needs a convention for views to find them from the but models are only accessed from logic in the controller so the framework need to know about being said i have seen most people build their models just like they built their entities or domain model before if you are using an active record pattern then name the models to correspond with the tables they are mapped if you are focusing more on a domain then name the models to correspond with the part of the domain they are i have seen more and more people creating a set of view models that are just used for presenting data to the ui and are created by pulling in parts from various models in your models are definitely the least opinionated part of but that is a good thing imo since people have very different ways they like to work in this

cookie needs to be generated because the session binds the client to the and therefore the token exchange must go from server to client at some it would not really be useful to generate the cookie because the client the untrusted remote is possible to have the cookie set during an ajax to the server the an ajax call is simply an http and any http response by the server can set a so it is possible to initiate a session in response to an ajax and the cookie will be stored by the client as you can use ajax to do the logging in process in the same was as you could have just relied on a post from a form on the the server will see them the same and if the server sets a cookie the browser will store javascript never needs to be able to know the value of the cookie it is better for security if it which can be achieved using the cookie extension honored by recent note that further http calls from the client to the whether they are normal page requests or they are ajax will include that cookie even if marked httponly and the browser honors that your script does not need to be of the mentioned using ssl that prevents others from being able to read information in so very handy for preventing plain text transmission of the password or other important it can also help guard against network based though it does not make you immune to everything that csrf can throw and it does not at all protect you against the likes of session fixation or so i would avoid thinking of ssl as a fix all if you use i sort of combined that the cookie is set by the server in its http response yes it is to make it compatible you still need to ensure logging in is possible when ajax is this may require implementing an alternative that is seen only when there is no javascript or if ajax now in become a lot more realistic to rely on ajax support in would not change the there would be no need for except that i have seen hidden iframes used before to ajax before ie make asyncronous calls to the however you do it the server setting the and the client will accept and return the cookie whether it does it by ajax or the most whether you use ajax or not does not affect the security all that much as all the real security happens on the server and to the server an ajax call is just like a not to be therefore need to be aware of issues such as and as well as issues affecting the session as a whole like and just as much as you would if you were using no the issues really change when using ajax i that you may make more mistakes with a technology if less familiar with it or more updated july

correct approach to handling tags depends on your preferences on processing you can either remove the invalid tags or try and clean the tags so they become approach to defining valid characters should be used in cleaning the input there is simply too many problematic characters to note that the hyphen must be first or last in a character class to match instead of specifying a character set first approach removes invalid tags the first ignoring invalid as if second approach tries to clean the the second cleaning up the tag remove trim multiple white illegal characters with whitespace leads to for example the above is converted to the illegal characters entirely would result in more useful in some

few books and articles ever go into detail about why multiple methods are provided to complete a specific task in a specific scenario and what considerations a developer should take when choosing between specific case in point is the simple opening of a text file first section of any io most just say how to open a text streamreader with file tada and end of do at least list the fact that there are multiple classes that allow you to do this discuss that there are even more overloads so you can use each class in several different fewer even try to enter into any discussion about how to select the best method for the task at of course do and these are the ones that usually end up in the top three when someone posts a question about lack of discussion drives me i feel like i should toss a question has the joint purposes out if anyone thinks this is a worthwhile topic in the first people an opportunity to list any interesting articles or books that specifically go into these kinds of made this a wiki because other similar questions were made into and if people feel this question has no i apologize and feel free to vote it am currently reading about binarywriter and the last 20 articles i have hit using google and at least 5 books on safari have shown me how to write a single integer and read it a couple included an example of how to use writestring and exactly one let me know that and use a special encdoding meaning if you do and you get a there are lots of ways to use these why do hardly any articles discuss example of what i mean is when a book or article lists class members and descriptions word for word from msdn without adding any i do not need a list of class members because i can get that from from an i need real world knowledge stuff that will expand me as a not stuff i can look up in five all the member lists and simple examples in the world going to really help anyone who wants to learn their one i reading about stringwriter and same lots of articles and books giving simple some at least say something vague like i may want to use stringwriter if i want to write characters to an underlying how would i know if i want to do what real world scenarios would require i could go on all so i has answers from merhdad and jalf that both explain how you would choose between two methods of generating a random number and demonstrates the kind of information i am talking jalf something along the lines of most cases use option but in this specific case when you are trying to achieve result use option and by the this will have negative effect vs y figured out i can get what i want by searching for x vs y articles based class library many ways to do a specific task what are the top x vs y articles and

file replication is we have a web application across 8 different iis due to the nature of the minor changes to files and controls happen frequently throughout the and after being tested and published to are replicated out to each of the public webservers through xcopy deployment on a scheduled basis every 10 course this is incredibly as each server must have a redundant copy of the entire and we would like to eliminate the publishing hosting from shared now have the option to use centralized storage with an iscsi interface to host the entire site with each server believing that the remote storage is a local publishes would be instantaneous and hosting the drive off a unc share is not as there are so many different directories in the site each requiring a filesystemwatcher for to monitor for that the smb maximum command count is quickly we know about the maxcmds and maxmpxct registry changes trigger massive problem we forsee is that certain changes to the file system structure can cause nearly every compiled or to have to causing queued requests and a perception that the server is most resources are not used and so recompiling them on a change causes hardly a blip in a global master page used by all pages on the site can cause but this can easily be managed by primary culprit is the changes to the file cause the entire web application to and recompilations to we currently replicate any changes requires bringing the web server off the load applying the and then warming the server up with junk requests before it is placed back on the load if the like the rest of the web directory is located on centralized there is only one copy of the and individual servers could not be patched and warmed up there a way to get an web application to take its marching orders from a source other than a file named there would be one file per for is the name defined is there a registry setting that could be set on a is there an entry that could be made in the or the global to specify what file to out of so i am i am not asking how to have different appsettings for and there are other topics that cover and all my will be identical most of the the only time i need them to be different is when an update is being using the for any appsettings this is for the really important like assembly httphandler and other settings that can not be tried searching the registry for and found nothing except for applications that noted that i had recently edited which i apparently do a no help in website hosted from shared

following comment on my regex solution incite my to perform a this a situation where regex is a little overly a straight solution would be simpler and more i response was the i decided for regex because you get all cases covered your regex is if you do it with and get a simpler solution if the input is but catching all invalid using string methods might really become when i start parsing a number decimal i already know that it is a valid number and will not think of inputs like you will split them but crash quite sure or return a meaningless in code accessing will out of bounds for the input parsing may and there are sure a few more uncatched catching them all will probably the code more unreadable than the regex i decided to use microsofts awesome tool and analyse my regex approach and string opertion i left code unmodified and replaced the console output in my solution with statements that build the result as just like david make a quite complete analysis i constraint pex to generate only inputs shorter than 45 characters and use only the following 9 different is no need to use all because they behave all the i included 9 to make it easy to discover the overflow but 0 and 1 schould also be sufficent pex would probaly find 1000 instead of i included 0 and 1 to discover an error with very tiny numbers like but nothing i assume very small numbers are silently rounded to zero but i did not investigate this or may be 44 because of the precision of decimal of 28 to 29 digits plus some room for other characters were just to short to generate a small enough the other characters are because they are the other valid characters in the finally i included the exclamation mark as surrogate for invalid result of the analysis proved me pex found two bugs in my i do not check for null input skipped that intentionaly to concentrate on the important causing the well known nullreferenceexception and pex discovered that the input causes to fail with an also reports some false negative for example was reported as an input causing a reruning the generated test yields no it turns out that caused the test to fail during looking at other failed tests reveals that fails for inputs starting with a decimal point during the but they are valid numbers and do not fail during normal i am unable to explain this false here is the result for one run of pex against the string operation both implementation share the missing null check and the overflow but the simple string operation solution is unable to handle many malformed they almost all result in a but pex discovered also the indexoutofrangeexception i question is how hard would it be to handle all this the simple solution would be to guard the parsing instruction with i am not sure if this is sufficent to guarantee correct operation on the well formed part of the but may this is not required and a malformed input should cause an empty what would make it to fix the here are the code coverage results that i analysed the regex solution using decimal and single because pex was unable to instrument one method used inside for me a regex solution should really be they are somewhat harder to design and but they handle malformed inputs much robuster than a simple string operation based and just not to forget i did not checke if the results returned are at this is another

for those of you looking for an answer to the question as stated the standard limits the number of nested loops at compile at runtime this is a different issue as the only limit would be the size of the program i was looking too early on in the build the c file gets further preprocessing applied to off to the subsequent have a problem with c code generated via perl from a language that applies rules for generating in essense the input is a huge dictionary of exceptions for pronounciation the code is riddled with gotos and it worked up until one of the exception dictionaries reached 23k code is basically unreadable but i have managed to make the c code compile after removing what appears to be the 6200th nested for for two hundred more removed adding one makes it not compile gcc and xlc are able to handle these but acc pa is the 18324 killed due to text modification or page 28004 bus error exit code have found this and tried many of the suggested fixes without legacy reasons i have to compile for 32 bit uses a 32 bit library that i have no 64 bit counterpart 256 mb tried up to 4 16 mb tried up to 256 mb tried up to 1 suggestions at compiler settings or a good link for documetation for acc i am drowning in search have coded a workaround breaking the dictionary into two parts resulting in and i have had to touch some core logic i feel comfortable touching in order to pull this off and i was hoping to back down to the original limits the number of nested loops in

for you for everyone else in this going to have to create a bootstrap application that checks for the prerequisites and launches their installers where necessary and then launches your doubly unfortunate if your prerequisite needs are dependent on only certain rather than the whole as it means that have to implement the user interface in the bootstrap application as was the case with but we were starting from scratch so we have to recreate a user interface that already implemented in the we actually tried a hybrid approach where the first few screens of the ui were in the bootstrap app and the rest were in the but there were too many frustrations so we gave up on that idea in short with the ui in the bootstrap the user would select the features that they want and then the bootstrap app if present a page that says the prerequisites are being installed and install them at that point before going on to the next when launching your the bootstrap app feeds it all of the info that was gathered from the ui via command line you may even wish to put launch conditions into your msi to prevent it from being run directly except in uninstall or repair

give them the true reasons i was in a company i actually wanted to work that rather than having been enslaved by usually this is get my job done faster if i have and my time is worth a lot to being more if the question do situations arise where you want to pay for the software in question the core competence out of which the company makes its in the case of then the same thing but with instead of and its instead of its so going to get a package the question is whether to get the expensive which no good free option or where the expensive software is better than the free due to better lower tco account of not having to fix the bugs or the package just a hosted and the cost to the organisation of training someone to install the service and keeping a whole person to maintain it would be even more than the this is another part of but it applies even if the software itself costs the same either the first point is that games companies be writing their own web app companies be writing their own banking software departments be writing office unless you really think that better off doing that than writing or web or trading or whatever you have actual deadlines obviously there are some if you want a tiny little script or webapp it may be easier just to write it than to find something off the shelf that does what you the second means different things to different assuming equal if your department is full of linux geeks then the free option probably has more than if you have no linux and also need an sla on the package in if the is going to be compiled into your as opposed to just supporting your then obviously software is useless to you whereas would probably be and so

going to input a splash screen to an application currently working on that only consists of one form which we will call frmmain for i want to implement a splash screen but need advice as to what would be the best way to implement the purpose of the splash screen will be to load necessary settings into based on the last settings of when the program was last my i let the main form but keep it invisible to the user and then call the splash screen which will run and then load all the settings into the main so how would i do the load the frmsplash in the i plan to keep the splash screen visible for at least 3 how would i give it the pause effect so that it stays up for 3 seconds while it recovers the settings from the settings what is the ideal method of adding a splash screen to a	
going to say on rails is a complete and basically closed technology stack from prototype for javascript to rails for orm on the now this can be good because it means that any ruby programmer coming onto a project will know what to but bad as well because fads look at the rise of jquery over the last 2 jquery is it dominant javascript now you can use jquery with ruby but the fit is a bit awkward since basically throwing away your prototype of the reasons and java have been enduring is that the tchnology stack is basically pluggable so it really matter what fad is because fad will of those two i would pick	
good example at rolling your own implementation of mvc using windows forms can be found source code is you and write code for this assignment you are going to find that there are a lot of disagreements on how mvc should be this one is a simple case that reflects the separation of concerns as well as a good example of the required to hook this you are out of school you will probably want to fall back on a framework like the other posters have

got 4 different books in front of along with numerous sample code from the yet somehow i still feel like missing some fundamental understanding of how drawing works in meant to simply be a hook in which to execute your drawing or is this method supposed to also redraw regions that are and need can i just draw my stuff once and then it or must i repaint the whole scene at any time via graphics2d object works this you must draw your whole every time is so you must be prepared to it at any time cache would you implement a simple drawing would you have to each that the user and replicate that each time is how about can you do all your drawing and then call to have your writes flushed to the say that in response to a i want to put an on the screen where he touched the x should remain and each new touch produces another do i need to remember all these touchup coordinates and then draw them all in joconor and hector answers below are contradicting each and a good demonstration of my confusion concerning this 2d drawrect method

guarantee that collisions occur that you have more items to hash than there are possible values of the a good hash algorithm will make it so that collisions occur is important for url generation because the total number of urls that exist is greater than the values that can be stored in a fixed string i believe you see a counter that is incremented and uses a number system with a large base 62 for for digits characters and to represent the value of the counter which is

guessing referring to the following line as the one with the confusing 1 break this represents an initial index into the array and i is simply the current so this is effectively iterating the array starting at index 1 this is calculating the number of bits to shift by and is doing so based on the current this number will start at size and will decrease as the loop 1 this shifts the value at by the specified number of dos a bitwise or expression on the bytes that are still available once the iterated value has been

happens because always queries the this is a design they do it this because else they would have to execute the query against the against the local cache and then merge the as one of the developers pointed out in a blog remeber where they were unable to handle this you can imagine there are a lot of corner an edge cases you have to handle you could just find a id you created created by someone else in the this would force you to be prepeared to handle conflicts on every maybe they could have made methods to querry the local cache and methods to query the but that is not to may have a look at lazy loading for entity this replaces the normal code generator and you get entites that populate their related entiy collections and entity references automaticaly on this avoids all and you can query the collections because they are always implicitly but this solution is not there are some for if you create a new entity and access a collection of releated you will get an exception because the code is unable to retrieve the releated entities from the there is also an issue concerning data binding and may be some more i am not aware good thing is that you get the source code and are able to fix the issues yourself and i am going to examin the first issue if i find some but i am quite sure that it will not be that easy to because i exspect some case were just not hitting the database if the entity has just been created is not the exspected

hard to say exactly what this without more i presume working on someone code and the lines showing appear scattered across a number of best guess as to the code intent is that this is a mechanism to deal with it is common in to use libraries with your own if those libraries need to temporarily hold data that you created and you need a way to give the library access to your data even though the library know about your one example is a if a library will asynchronously notify you when an event you need to give it a function pointer and also data so that when the function is you know what to do with libraries commonly take a pointer for this it is common in to just pass in an object instance for the data and then delegate to that object to handle the what the code would look library void user ptr do something with myclass new the callback is now armed with all the data it libraries accomplish this by declaring this is a raw pointer to some memory anything could be at that an a class a the library holds onto that pointer and returns it back to your code at some 3rd line of your example code is taking the pointer and casting it to a reference to a class references are like pointers except they cannot be null and they use value syntax the operator instead of the for the 4th line of your example code then uses a method on the class if all 4 lines of code are consecutive in the code base dealing that code means that ignorant of a more compact way to do the same code in one if you prefer value

have not seen anywhere that an action accesses another view for the special case of error my idea is using you throw different exceptions for different bad and in your error handler you can decide what to show to user based on the exception function some if throw new the bad if throw new the other bad function the original exception object thrown by some switch decide different things for different more information about error the framework quick is a great other you can use some messaging mechanism to communicate between these 2 using flashmessenger action helper is the first thing comes into my function some if if function if do elseif remember that flashmessenger uses so sessions and most likely cookies are going to be involved in this messaging

have one costly function that gets called many times and there is a very limited set of possible values for the return code depends only on arguments so the obvious way to speed things up is to keep a static cache within the function for possible arguments and corresponding return so for every combination of the the costly operation will be performed only always use this approach in such situations and it works fine but it just occurred to me that gcc function attributes or probably can help me with anybody have experience with how gcc uses and attributes only at compile time or at runtime as i rely on gcc to be smart enough to call a declared once for the same parameter or there is no guarantee whatsoever and i better stick to caching my question is not about but gcc function function attributes vs

have this big graph of edges and vertices in 2d the big graph is returned by a function computed in a i am reading this graph and using it to compute all the intersections of its edges lines i use sweep for detecting the intersection of two edges i have though some i have 4 different methods according to which i test if two edges intersect and if affirmative i compute and retain their which test if the two edges are the diagonals of a that coordinates of the edges of one line inserted into the equation other line have different which computes the intersection each time and check whether intersection is between the endpoints of both which is the code from implemented in which implements the first method proposed by jason cohen problem reduces to this do two lines from a to b and from c to d then you can ask it four times the line and each of the four sides of the the vector math for doing assuming the line from a to b is the line in question and the line from c to d is one of the rectangle my notation is that ax is the of and cy is the of and means so ex p f p h number is the if h is between 0 and the lines otherwise they if is of course you cannot make the but in this case the lines are parallel and therefore only intersect in the obvious exact point of intersection is c h is exactly 0 or 1 the lines touch at an you can consider this an or not as you see data that i created data with double i obtained good results with all the 4 implemented when i use anyone of these methods implemented in on the data from the big graph i get different results each time and not good returns much more intersections that i need the points are on the but i get too many always obtain 0 intersections no matter get a lot more intersection than in some example i get points which are not on the graph not even the but for some examples i get the intersection points plus some other have no idea where the problem can any suggestion or any other idea on how to compute the intersection and test it moreover are ore than thank intersection of two

i really know glsl been doing gpgpu programming with the amd stream which has different programming you comment on i gather that you are interested in using the gpu to sort a huge database like creating a reverse phone book or but you have a small dataset and each fragment has own dataset to more like trying to do median pixel can only say in small the sort algorithm really while people have spent careers worrying about which is the best sort algorithm for very large for small n it really matter whether you use quick heap radix shell optimized bubble unoptimized bubble at least it matter much on a are simd so they like to have each kernel executing the same operations in lock calculations are cheap but branches are expensive and branches where each kernel branchs a different way is if each kernel has own small dataset to and the of data to sort is data dependent and it could be a different number for each probably better off picking a maximum size you padding the arrays with infinity or some large and having each kernel perform the exact same which would be an unoptimized branchless bubble something like i know sort of 9 points tmp min b a b a n n for i i twosort

i understand it software being open source does not prevent you from selling it this depend on the type of but is this a good my pet project the target audience is for the most part who know how to compile the source but i still want to keep it open mostly for possible future employers to view my as well as to get critique from or just for others to learn expect to quit my day job from it or mostly just to defray minor costs like web domain and other misc and hopefully some pocket support really an and app and one of the primary objectives is to make it as easy to use as closest license that sounds like be friendly to this is the but google code which currently using support that and a quick search looks like sourceforge either could be currently but i just have a few classes stubbed out right so changing an there any examples of other people doing this or am i better off just asking for should i just not license it as open source it automatically closed source if i have any license but just distribute it upon any other options i thought what more interested aside from the legal aspect is whether the practice of straight selling open source software is generally frowned will i piss off customers that bought it and later found out it was open should i announce it on the site or keep a link from to retail site but not the other way announce it but not make it software as open source but charging for compiled

is a and so contains oodles of good and bad advice on me just tell you what i have found from much experience doing performance are tradeoff curves between performance and other things like memory and and you would expect that to get better performance you would have to give something is only true if the program is the tradeoff most as first is away from the tradeoff most of the it is irrelevant and ignorant to talk about giving up one thing to get method i use is not it is i care how fast various routines are or how often they are i want to know precisely which instructions are causing and dominant and primary cause of poor performance in software efforts little is too many layers of abstraction are each of which extracts a performance this is not usually a problem until it is a problem and then a what i do is tackle one issue at a i call these short for each slug that i remove yields a speedup of anywhere from to depending on how bad it every slug that is removed makes the remaining ones take a larger fraction of the remaining so they become easier to in this all the can be quickly disposed that i know what is costing the but the fixes may be more such as partial redesign of the possibly by removing extraneous data structure or using code if it is possible to do that can set off a new round of until the program is many times not only faster than it was to begin but smaller and clearer as recommend getting experience like this for because then when you design software you will know what to and you will make better designs to begin at the same you will find yourself at odds with less experienced colleagues who begin thinking about a design without conjuring up a dozen to try to answer your optimization should be done when diagnosis says you have a some code at the bottom of the call stack appears on enough call stack samples or to be known to be costing significant and if the is in code you can if got a in or look higher up the stack for things to get rid that	
is a app to learn how to program it uses these global functions that but they do very specific tasks as i this is a horrible example of what good code should there are other functions that just return the part looking rather than me just writing what you you can read full listing take care that you note down which must be within the mythical loop and which you can use it happens there are even more ways to get the but i was really imagining for this example you would do something i is the post id inside the loop though i could be as another poster says you can use a fairly simple function to grab the current loop brings me back to perhaps wanting to explain why learning programming from wordpress is a bad they have so many damned way of doing the same damned thing that almost impossible to keep on top of blog is a really simple set of data moreso in case because it fully but rather than just having one way to output a title echo you have umpteen all doing subtly different you really want to learn how to program of hacking your way around the crap that is the wp creating a simple blog engine is fairly quick and certainly how a lot of people get into a new language or if you want to have have a look at of the wordpress if fighting something like this in the future that have 100 ways of doing i really recommend it uses up a whole buttload of resources for something relatively easiest way can be as simple as just taking the source for the original sticking it in a new function and replacing the with note there may be some database connectivity to handle that returning prematurely may so if the echo the last instead of returning right store the string as a variable and return at the end of the

is about set or more relational read a brief primer on and learn to think in not in the practical there are four fundamental which show some projection of a which remove some subset of a which add rows to a which change data in a i mean any including the empty and not necessarily a proper i can write a column name in ddl as the target of an i can write an expression that uses column or 3 from will return the resultset 2 once for each row in the if the column named is of type and the function returns a month number given a from will show me the month number for each where clause is a predicate that restricts rows or or updated to those rows for which the predicate is a where cause can be composed of an arbitrary number of predicates connected by the logical operators and just like the column list in a i can use column and constants in my what result set do you think is returned from from table where 1 a tables are related by in which some datum or key in one is related by an operator to a datum or key in another the relational operator is often but can in fact be any binary operator or even a are as i mentioned by a row in a table may relate to or many rows in another this is referred to as the cardinality of the relations may be there are standard ways of representing each before you look up the standard ways to do think about how represent each what the minimum requirements of each kind see that a relation can in fact also model and ask yourself given all relations are not among pioneered the idea of normal form in relational there are commonly held to be five or six normal but the most important summary of normal form is every entity that your database models should be represented by one row and one row every attribute should depend on the and every row should model an entity or a a primer on normal and understand why you can get data inconsistencies if a your database all try to understand why i like to say you lie to the it will lie to by this i mean bad i mean bad if you model a relation as what can be what can happen if your tables in practical is a select query given a name and stored in the if i often join table to table through the relation maybe i can write a view that selects the columns of interest from that and use the view instead of alway rewriting the write a whatever be simpler and clearer if you write a view for every calculation or you write a view that encapsulates each write a view that encapsulates each almost anything you want to do can be done in a a query into views serves the same ends as functional decomposition serves in procedural it allows you to concentrate on doing one thing makes it more easily and allows you to compose more complex functionality out of simpler an example where i use views to transform a table into forms that more easily allow me to apply successive in order to get to a conflate each table ought to unambiguously model one thing kind of and only one each column should express one and only one attribute of that different kinds of entities belong in different is your your database platform will provide some what it provide you should since metadata is all the rules for modeling data you can for the names of all objects in your database from the sytem table contains all the to find all the columns in one join and on and add a clause restricting the resultset to a particular table sit down at a database and ask can i represent people with hair colors and professions and what tables and relations are implied in modeling then model as ask can i show all blonde doctors who reside in and write the query that does piece it together by writing views that show you all all and all people who reside in find that in asking can i find expose deficiencies in your and find that you want or even need to change the way your model make the see how they make your queries easier or harder to

is based on previous experiences with what i consider to be the best practices on the scale of the code this can range from another developer to the whole team in the case of something big being added to the overall for small the review is mainly a way to double check what was done while on the larger everyone should know what is going on and be able to ask questions to those who put in the new to it for large it makes sense to have more eyes on it while if the code change was to fix a that merit the same any completion of a code bug or new functionality should merit some form of diffing in subversion is useful for some reviews though think there should be other stuff out i just seen few other reviews can vary from seeing the differences in code and results of the application to going line by line through pages of printed out i like a more formal structure which tries to be simple in terms of communicating what was why and seeing that it does what it should for big this can take hours but then if the developers that did the work went on vacation and it had to be changed asap it would take longer to understand what is going on in some i

is but as others have said i call on the reason is that intersect does create the intersection of the two it creates an that is of that but it actually enumerate those results most of the work is deferred until the time when you finally iterate over this problem with is that it does iterate over the entire so not only does it always count all the but it causes all of the work involved in computing those results to run as instead will be fast by because you will compute one intersection result before of in the case where there are no matches it will still need to iterate the entire no worse off than you were in still faster because as jon skeet the function uses a hashset to compute the results rather than iterating over your best and average cases are improved like the difference between these two count i in foreach j in if this one should look i in foreach j in if return the 2nd is much faster on the performance of would be the same thanks to the the 2nd while would be analogous to the	
is dead easy to i built the following convenience they are structured so that you can construct an assembly from fragments of source code defining methods or expressions and invoke them by name using the helper methods of code is compiled on demand in response to adding more methods will cause automatic recompilation on next provide only a method if you want to return a value then return null and bother to use the object returned by you use this in commercial code do me a favour and credit my the real jewel in this library is the invocation getting the code to compile the quite tricky to get reflection to correctly match the method signature when you have a variable length parameter this is the reason for the existence of the compiler resolves method binding to this explicitly declared base class giving us access to the right from there on in it all comes out in the should also point out that this capability makes your desktop application vulnerable to script injection you should either take great care to vet the origin of script or reduce the trust level under which the generated assembly public abstract class public bool params methodname bindingflags flags return public object params bindingflags flags return public double params functionname bindingflags flags return public static class internal statics and static new static new static string codestart public class dynamic static string dynamicconditionprefix static string conditiontemplate bool return static string methodtemplate object static string codeend static new static assembly public static assembly assembly get return manage public static void public static void if else if public static void string if throw new is already a condition called stringbuilder src new the condition is invalid an exception will occur public static void string if throw new is already a method called if throw new is not a valid method name because the prefix is reserved for internal use with stringbuilder src new the condition is invalid an exception will occur use public static object params dynamicbase if as return public static bool params dynamicbase if as return public static double params dynamicbase if as return support public static string stringbuilder cn new foreach c in if string conditionname return private static void if stringbuilder src new foreach kvp in foreach kvp in private static assembly compilerparameters cp new compilerresults cr if throw new return public static bool return

is hard to give an answer to this without seeing a lot more detail about what you are trying to i would not normally inherit from collection as it does not really give enough virtual methods to this can make altering the behaviour of your class a little tricky in the trouble with inheritance is that if you use it you will be stuck with the collection base behaviour forever or face a complex for you may want to add searching and sorting operations at which point you will need to switch to list from you may even want to do data binding where you will need a bindinglist instead of a different plan would be to inherit from icollection or better still and then delegate to a private collection this gives you maximum control and allows you to alter the internal representation of your class without affecting the public the trouble with this is that it takes longer to develop you what you are facing is a trade off between faster development and future and as i said at the start it is a bit difficult to judge which way to go from the information given in the original to make an implementation simply return true from isreadonly and then throw a notsupportedexception from all the methods that alter the

is the correct way to represent a value such the dom level 2 call is the null value is is also used to indicate a valid element with no content even if that elements content type normally allow empty an empty tag is returns the empty string the tag is then no author tag is even this may be semantically different than setting it to setting to nil may be that the book belongs to no while omitting series could mean that series is an inapplicable element to the current structures introduces mechanism for signaling that element should be accepted as when it has no content despite content type which does not require even necessarily allow empty an element may be content if it has the with the value element so labeled must be can carry attributes if permitted the corresponding complex you have a book xml element and one of the child elements is you have several options when filling it the element entirely this can be done when you wish to indicate that series does not apply to this book or that book is not part of a in this case xsl transforms other event based that have a template that matches will never be for if your xsl turns the book element into table row you may get the incorrect number of table cells using this the element empty this could indicate that the series is or is or that the book is not part of a any xsl transform other evernt based that matches will be the value of will be you will get the same number of tags using this method as with the next described this signifies that the element is not just your xsl transform other event based that have a template matching will be the value of will be empty empty the main difference between this method and is that the schema type of does not need to allow the empty string as a valid this makes no real sense for a series but for a language element that is defined as an enumerated type in the allows the element to have no another example would be elements of type if you want them to be empty you can union an enumerated string that only allows and a or use a decimal that is

is the obvious one you should be gwt has its own rpc controller framework so i really think what you would need a web application framework is a reasonable choice on several fronts but it has problems one its potentially an issue sending jpa objects to the gwt to at enforces a pretty strict directory structure so have to put your entities under the gwt source that serializing jpa entities to and from the client is potentially entities are fairly rigid objects that map almost to your that tend to be how you use data in a presentation layer direct sql will allow you to pick and choose which data you do and tailored specifically for that so jpa entities will typically have lots of fields not interested in and serialize collections of that aspect of it to the often cited as an advantage of your code end up littered with value thing you still end up with the same thing in but instead of being in the persistence layer or the business layer you end up with them in the presentation now you might call that an i call it six of half a dozen of the actually think ibatis is a far better fit to the gwt application model than jpa for the reason that you are using direct objects tailored for your purpose and those objects can be used all the way from the database to the now this concept may horrify the layering zealots that are quite common in java land but remember layering is a means to an end not an end in use it if it helps if it spring is the absolute must in this also refer you to google web toolkit more and an orm or plain

it has something to do with memory the first loop indexes the inner dimension of which happens to span over only 3 bytes each within one memory page easily believe a common size here is 4kb for one but with your second the outer index changes that will cause memory reads spread over a much larger range of memory namely which is and with each change of the inner those jumps start to happen that will hit different pages and is probably somewhat also i heard the cpu reads ahead that will make the first version because at the time it that data is probably already in the i can imagine the second version benefit from because it makes those large jumps around the memory back and would suspect the difference is not that but if the algorithm runs many it eventually becomes you probably want to read the article on that is the scheme used to store arrays in

jalf suggests in the you probably want to use a variant of the recurring template that make a class template parametrised by the derived myhashingsolution typedef d void int void just for return this because you want the derived class to also be a you need to take the slightly unusual step of declaring as a class template that takes a template class state public void int requires int return key point is provided inherits from is a derived class of so the downcast in compiles and works you mess up and derive from instead and then try something that involves a call to the compiler will complain as the requirements for are not declare the concrete class you want to use like this solution has the side effect that you will need to change any other such to templates that ignore their one template in order to make them usable as template template

key parameters of the api you cited are the picture the and the the tag can be either the user id of a facebook or it can be text the case when the tagged subject is not a facebook facebook uses just one coordinate because it uses regions to denote a tagged the idea is that you click on the center of a and facebook just stores that you display a picture in a control the obvious first after you can detect mouse clicks with the and event is but tell you the once acquired a prompt for a label to accompany that you can use predetermined like user or just use ordinary or use something of your own the question of what you use to represent a tag value is orthogonal to whatever other questions asked so other half of photo tagging is that moving the mouse over the image displays the tag text over the and moving the mouse over the labels below highlight the associated handle events and write some code to display or hide labels and shapes as if you use and you might not even have to modify the but showing those controls on top of the image might interfere with further events for the it take too long to try some experiments and see what works for

kind events do you want to setting up a message pump will allow you to process windows api but since this is a console i think of any windows api messages that would be of tend to think of as being associated with windows messages because controls in windows forms application respond to user input using eventhandler which are called in response to windows api no reason you use delegates in a console and you need a message you can even use the eventhandler altough it will seem out of place because it be resonding to windows api course there are other kinds of that you might be interested the most common kind of event scenario involving a console app is to wait for input from the console also common to block on a waithandle or other synchronization object if there are multiple threads in both of these cases could be considered a type of event you create a hidden window time honored still need a windows message to respond so the question to or to are you trying to	
kind of client are we talking windows client or there are two very general patterns for you can either push or pull the pushing work if your on the internet run into firewalls and so you end up with a third variation where the client initates the and the server leaves the connection open to send information back and need to provide a lot more are we talking about internet or what framework are you how many clients are you a solution that can handle a dozen clients in a push model or the third could look very different from a solution which can scale to thousands of easiest solution is to do polling from the client which unless you want the server to have instant communication to the client is the way to and a heart beat is not instant you indicated are you really sure you want to do lower level network type why not build upon existing network strategies such as you can do a simple remoting service over http which will let you bypass or even better if your server is a web server then just setup a plain old xml have any examples i can share of but there should be plenty

main difference when it comes to oop and programming is that you would like your new thread to have as its function a method of an there are a few programming models for implement a interface is the most common used your class implements a standard interface that has a method which is usually a virtual method called you put your code in that virtual method and when you need to spawn a thread you create a thread object called and you pass to it an object of your class that implements the then you call the method of that object and that will take care that the code you have written in your class will be run a a new in this example both and are provided by the chosen threading library or by the standard of the programming language of your also please note that the names of these two classes can is a big difference between and java when it comes to has not support for as opposed to java which has support for for you will need to use a specialized threading library such as pthreads or more general purpose libraries such as poco which already have support for the least recommended way is to call directly the related services of the no matter what edition you are using you will already have the support for programming	
main problem is that you have to mock the htmlhelper because you may be using methods of the helper to get routes or values or returning the result of another extension the htmlhelper class has quite a lot of properties and some of them quite complex like the viewcontext or the current post from ben that explains how to create such a mock with can be easily translated to another mock is my rhino mocks version adapted to the changes in the mvc not fully tested but working for me but expect perfect public static htmlhelper var mocks new var cc new var mockviewcontext new var mockviewdatacontainer return new	
main reason for the character classes is so that the notation stops at the first white space even if you specify field and you quite often want it in that the character class notation can be extremely this code to read a line of up to 10 discarding any but keeping char int while int c if was actually example code for a discussion on june related to least some confusion the first format reads up to 10 characters and they are assigned to along with a trailing the second format contains the assignment suppression character and reads zero or more remaining characters from the when the function the input is pointing at the next newline the body of the loop reads and prints that so that when the loop the input is looking at the start of the next the process then if the line is shorter than 10 then those characters are copied to and the or more format processes zero

may be a simpler way of doing this and i am all ears if there my situation is i have a dropdownlist on a form which i successfully populate with text and i also need to have additional related string values from the same table row in the db table available on the client so when the user selects from the dropdown this related data gets populated in a textbox on the there are only 4 records dealing with so storing on the client is no big i thought about passing this data via viewdata as a list and loading into a javascript when the user selects from the dropdown i would determine the selected index and get the related data i need from the i am already using the value of the dropdown item for other required data so i need a way to get this related data without making a return trip to the if i am on the right track could someone post a simple example of populating a js array with sting values returned as a list in the simple example of how to populate javascript array from viewdata

mostly i would only change one thing in the connect method as i explain in connections are not everything is done with no connection state is stored unless you implement this in third objects as you do with your the objects in python bindings are mostly proxies that abstract the remote objects as if you were to but what it really does is to build messages based on the information you give to object instantiation interface and so the service cannot know when the client is done if client announce it with other explicit handle unexpected client finalization you can create a object in the client and send the object path to the service when change your method to accept also an the service can listen to signal to know if a client has create the individual object you only have to instantiate an object in the same service as you do with your but you have to be sure that you are using an unexisting you could have a and various if you need to store the connection you have to do something like

my the greatest danger a team runs from measuring code coverage is that it rewards large and penalizes small if you have the choice between writing a single test that covers a large portion of your and writing ten small tests which test a single only measuring code coverage implies that you should write the large writing the set of 10 small tests will give you much less brittle and will test your application much more thoroughly than the one large test by measuring code particularly in an organization with still evolving testing you can often set up the wrong

need a layer of abstraction to provide a little security at way i do this is to write a simple udp with root privs in python watches out for incoming udp packets on a given compares them to a if they match carry out the then have a little bit of php that messages the python server with python server watches for packets on port 12345 but just ignores any that either or as it runs as root it can happily start your bash you absolutely must use it is really not safe to send any input from a udp socket to the command line note that udp can be spoofed so if your firewall permits spoofed inbound traffic realy ought not someone could send forged packets to your python server and your this is unlikely to be a problem but if you fix your firewall and you want to guard against it you could rework the above using which be a really trivial server to write lines but if you know how to then just message me and i will send it to you or post it

need some framework that will help me to do asynchronous streaming over it may look like soap ws or somethign i know if i name it so here is what i wants to make a request to remote serverb over the request contains arbitrary result for it is going to contain multiple records of the same some of them are available other are available servera wants to get available results as soon as without waiting until all results are in real world serverb will search across different data some of which are more responsive that can think of 3 kinds of servera generates random id of performs soap request will return and then a periodically calls servera polls serverb fore new i call this method it involves multiple connections established from a to another solution is to expose receiving service on servera like call serverb pushes new results to when new results are i call it it involves 1 connection established from a to b and multiple connection established from b to option is to stream results over same http within single performs http call know if it can be soap or should be something b starts searching and when new results are it sends them over http stream and flushes so they may be available on the a side it does not close http connection until all results are it involves only single connection from a to thats why i would prefer to use i call it i understand that it may not work if some proxy is on the way that buffers the response my question is if there is any solution that will do most of the work for what like to do is call such code on a s new or or r new callback new void e should be null if finished void implement it on serverb serviceimpl implements void callback perform call when new results are the rest is handled by including reestablishing connection when it is falling to if streaming can not be done because of buffering calling when serverb finishes work or throws the probbaly it should also handle authentication in some standard is there any solution that abstracts the way commuinication is and is capabale of streaming when there is do you think it would be useful to implement it as open web service

no way to get a single sequential series without it matter what mechanism using to assign the next value a performance a static whatever when two threads both need the next value at the same one has to wait on the first thing do is write a test program that spawned a large number of threads which each repeatedly called a locking increment function such as the one daniel schaffer that will let you find the threshold where your application starts to thrash where spending more time waiting on than doing anything that turns out to be a problem and bet that if the volumes talking about are it will then you should make each thread maintain its own sequential which you can do by marking the counter field with the you can then generate unique identifiers off of a combination of the id and the approach work if not using a thread pool the counter dies when the thread it belongs to and you probably also want to make the startup count part of the compound so that you have to write the thread counters to durable you do when you restarted the server the threads would start generating counters at zero and if your application created a thread with the same id as an earlier get duplicate is obviously not trivial to write more so definitely recommend proving that necessary

not like martial where learning two very different styles at the same time can confuse your muscle memory and prevent the only is that by dividing your you divide your but not necessarily a big would say that javascript is a decent one to learn not only for the obvious functionality and but also because it has in if you do enough php and web eventually you will probably need is not among my favorite languages and can be frustrating to deal with especially depending on your but a fact of life right and syntax is widely used and good to with that you get some hooks upon which you might or and so many for how many languages i sure at least a dozen things that could qualify as right now i feel pretty strong in and probably a few others and some of those are barely but what do you think those stand will tell you learn as many languages as you not necessarily all at once and not necessarily but indulge and cultivate that curiosity a core developer because more languages more last jquery is a fantastic tool that makes javascript more very powerful and you get instant eye once got your head around the syntax of i would recommend looking at

not very experienced in database but my feeling is if your business classes are well the only point where you access the databse is in your repositories a change in the database is just a change in the implementation of your bad database design will make your repository hard to and slow to but it will not impact your business layer of your you try to modify your business layer because of your dao why not to modify your business layer because of your presentation layer and then good luck to satisfy all constraint and good think that both are but coding and database design should not be in the same more important for the developer is to isolate himself from the work of the db if the db designer and the developer are the same you should not have to think about two thing at the same

of note that not an expert on device drivers i wrote a few myself back in the much less an expert on leave the fact that writing device drivers in a language is not a good idea performance and possibly many other aside for a and answer your write device drivers in almost any at least in device drivers need to do plenty of stuff like handling interrupts and communicating with the os using the os apis and system which i believe you do in if your device communicates a serial port or and if the os necessarily need to be aware of the device your application will access the then you can write the driver in any language that provides the necessary means to access the for example you probably write a scsi card driver in but you can write a driver for a proprietary control usb lava license the obvious question here of does that count as a berk

part of upgrading we are moving from a jvm to a now i am getting a really strange oracle db is in an inconsistent i have pinned down the problem to insert queries that do not use bind variables at all all inline if i run the query without any bind i get the above as soon as i replace one of the hard coded values with a bind variable everything works without other strange bit is that after executing the it is in fact committed to the i can connect from another session and see the inserted i have tried wrapping the query in a transaction and it seems to succeed as the behavior is unchanged from the query without an explicit are the relevant machine through i am using cfqueryparam they are called bind variables in the oracle while that does solve the immediate we have a rather large legacy code base that we realistically go through all of to update the queries as part of upgrading from cf7 to though i have pinned down one specific situation that fails encapsulated it in an mxunit that mean there other areas where this may be an i would really like to have a solution in place that removes the oall8 error rather than coding around after checking with our dba he had set a parameter called to the oracle default is what is happening is when coldfusion hands the query off to be oracle is turning all the literal values to bind variables and that appears to be confusing turning the setting back to exact allows the literal queries to work just oracle finally issued us an patch for it was identified as a jdbc the latest drivers should include it when they are finally if you have support you can also request the patch through their tar oall8 is in an inconsistent

personally always use import then access everything the reason is that at the same time you have short and you clearly define the module namespace of each something that is very useful if you have to search for usage of a given module in your to do not use the import because it pollutes your namespace and it does not tell you where a given function comes from which you can run in trouble if you have the same module name for two different modules in two different import import this of course you run into but then a strong hint that your package layout is and you have to rethink	
personally recommend to people facing similar problems to use something like keepass or roboform to store these programs encrypt your passwords on a thumbdrive using a master password that the individual so that they need only remember the master in the event that someone looses their they will have a window of time in which they can report the compromised and allow you to change it will take a little bit of depending on the master before the person who stole the thumb drive would be able to brute force the master password to get at all the other stored avoid having any account shared by more than 3 at consider creating each individual an account with equivalent if a malicious employee has access to an account which they know is it might be more tempting for them to do malicious things since they know you could not hold them since it could have been any of several people sharing the also means you have to change the password every time someone you just their so although you have more accounts to you have less overhead when someone leaves since you have to notify everyone of a changed oh roboform also has a online password sync service over so you could just have people retrieve passwords via kinda cool once you get used to

processing xml by means of standard attribute order is not guaranteed after you serialize at last that is what i just realized when using standard java xml transform api to serialize the i do need to keep an i would like to know if there is any posibility on java to keep the original order of attributes of an xml file processed by means of dom or any way to force the order by using an alternative serialization api that lets you set this kind of in my case processing reduces to alter the value of some attributes of a sequence of the same elements with a bunch of and maybe insert a few more there any way or do i have to define my own xslt transformation stylesheet to specify the output and altering the whole input xml i must thank all your the answer seems now more obvious than i i never paid any attention to attribute since i had never needed it main reason to require an attribute order is that the resulting xml file just the target is a configuration file that holds hundreds of alarms alarm is defined by a set of this file usually has little modifications over but it is convenient to keep it since when we need to modify something it is edited by now and then some projects need light modifications of this such as setting one of the attributes to a customer specific just developed a little application to merge original file to all with specific parts of each project the value of some so file gets the updates of the base one alarm definitions or some attribute values my main motivation to require ordered attributes is to be able to check the output of the application againts the original file by means of a text comparation tool as if the format attribute remains the the differences can be easily really thought this was since xml handling such as xml lets you edit xml files and apply some ordering maybe my only choice is to use one of these programs to modify the output of xml attributes after dom

question is lacking specifics needed for a good answer but give it a triggers are good for targeting tables but if you are interested in writes then need a better method that is easier to for writes investigate methods that detect changes in the transaction each vendor implements this part so one method that works for all vendors is not that a method that works within the database server is but there may be more elegant ways outside of the server at the os for if the transaction log is a file on disk then a simple script of some sort that detects changes in the file would indicate the db was written in mind you have asked only to detect a db if you need to know what type of write it was then need to get into the transaction log to see what is and that will definitely be vendor

really understand what conflict asking nor the problem with the fine to have two independent handles to the same thing i know that i learned in response to your question it that there is a new method on raises a new exception inside the generator to terminate the on receiving this the code must either raise or is called when a generator is so this means the code gets one last chance to run before the generator is this last chance means that statements in generators can now be guaranteed to the clause will now always get a chance to this seems like a minor bit of language but using generators and is actually necessary in order to implement the statement described by pep that handles the situation where a statement is used in a but it yields in the middle but never context method will be called when the generator is regards to the file handle i sometimes forget that there exist platforms that far as locks i think dowgird hits the head on the nail he just have to be aware that the generator is just like any other object that holds i think the statement is really that relevant since this function suffers from the same deadlock yield yield

recursive function is like a spring you compress a bit on each on each you put a bit of information on a when the final step is the spring is collecting all values at sure this metaphor is beyond the classical examples which is the worst example since it is inefficient and easily which are a bit artificial if use them in real programming it is interesting to see where it is really very common case is to walk a tree a but trees are more in a folder to list the you iterate on if you find a the function listing the files call itself with the new folder as when coming back from listing this new folder its it resumes its to the next file concrete case is when drawing a hierarchy of gui it is common to have like to hold components which can be panes or compound the painting routine calls recursively the paint function of each which calls the paint function of all the components it sure if i am very but i like to show real world use of teaching as it was something i was stumbling upon in the	
reference to which was excellent only described the when and where to use the another part of the answer is why are they needed many languages get along just fine without when designing aspects of the delphi object pascal oop oriented had been in the mainstream for several during this time it was observed that using many of the languages that had adopted those concepts to develop application frameworks suffered from what i called the you developed an awesome framework using language x and released it as version your users raved at all it could do and it became heavily flush with you decide to release version 2 with even more you specifically made sure it was fully backward you users started reporting strange their own virtual methods were being called at strange many reported that their old code would not compile with the new all the same and functionality still all you did was add a few virtual methods to some base some new object and some new optional what override and reintroduce directives serve to eliminate this problem by requiring that in order to actually a virtual method you must use the override directive in place of the virtual if you happen to introduce your own virtual method that has the same name as one of your virtual the compiler now warns but will still do the right in this using not only suppresses that it also serves to document in the source you intended to do the override and reintroduce you would not be able to continually evolve your framework without fear of breaking all your and if your users had to make massive modifications every time a new version is then they would be loathe to adopt the new using also allows the framework designer to change the type of virtual in the ancestors without breaking user for in delphi many methods are marked which is a runtime method lookup form of perform quite as fast as a regular virtual so it is usually used for methods that are rarely overridden are responses to user actions where the extra overhead is never suppose in v1 of the framework a method was marked but in practice it ended up being overridden and called more than you in you could change it to without fear of code being object pascal language the only language to recognize this requires the use of an directive for the exact same the standards committee is finally recognizing the problem and are modifying the language to support sort in if a name and parameter list matches an then it is an override if you say on the for the upcoming new if you specify and the signatures match then it is a new virtual method introduced on current if there is a signature match with the ancestor and the writer intend to then the keyword is used to tell the compiler that this is a virtual for this

responses have discussed the idea that matlab will look in the current directory for any files to be you are unsure what the current directory at the command will return the current the command when used with no will also display the current directory cd can also help you to move to a different directory when that is and of if you are unsure of the names of those files in a dir will help you you prefer to use a directory pushd and popd are nice functions to matlab does not find the file in and you have not specified an absolute perhaps generated by then it will look at other directories on your search so another idea if you frequently want to load files from a specific you can just add that directory to your search and pathtool will all be useful tools

rule of thumb is as there is ever a chance that i can take the core algorithm and refactor it in a way that i can use yield i will go with if my current implementation uses an array or a but i know at least i may want to and be capable of reworking it internally to do lazy return an found that the gains of returning are definitely worth the hassle of using if the in its very is going to need to fully evaluate the results before returning but does i will go with an if already computing return implements so all of the use cases still but you lose the lazy if already forced to evaluate in not a rarely return the only time i would use this interface is if directly creating a queryable data access or something the overhead of using this in most not worth the if your goal is to always use a single interface necessarily agree with this i would stick to

so here is a problem analogous to my problem elaborate on the real problem but i think this analogy will be easier to have a strange coin that only comes up heads 1 in every tosses remainder being in other for every tails i there will be 1 have a peculiar disease where i only notice 1 in every tails i but i notice every and so it appears to me that the rate of noticing a heads or tails is of aware of this disease and its effect so i can compensate for now gives me a new and i noticed that the rate of noticing heads is now given that my disease changed still only notice 1 in every how do i calculate the actual ratio of heads to tails that this new coin need to understand this to help with this so if it confuses you ignore it so what is the real i have a bunch of data consisting of and outputs which are 1s and i want to teach a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the expected output float between 0 and given an the problem is that the 1s are very and this screws up the internal math because it becomes very susceptible to rounding errors even with floating point i normalize the data by randomly omitting most of the 0 training samples so that it appears that there is a roughly equal ratio of 1s and of this means that now the machine learning output is predicting a instead of predicting as it it would now predict need a way to convert the output of the machine learning algorithm back to a probability within the original training a known bias in collected

sounds like you might be trying to describe a message authentication code takes a message a and the secret and data are hashed and the result is included with the message recipient who knows the secret can perform the same digest and compare his mac to the one that accompanied the received if they are he can trust that the message was not your i understand now that you are working with asymmetric rather than a secret which would be used in a still a little a private signature key is kept secret by its which in this case seems to be the a client can cryptographically prove that they possess a private key that corresponds to a public key without disclosing the private digital you can do something like is the private is its public the parameter is the data that gets if i understand your application i should be the client then is a message format that bundles and its signature your question is confusing because is used both generating and verifying a shared nothing in this scheme in the mac to stop one client from using value of all you can do with such a technique is to ensure that the message content has not been for if the message is something like you can make sure that mallory substitute his own ip address for if the message is just you stop alice from giving bob her message return for splitting the cost of a and you control whether mallory hacks into box and steals the the if message integrity really is all you and you can easily share a secret between the sender and a macs have some nice advantages over such as much smaller message size and faster the threats you are trying to defend cryptography is devising untried schemes usually ends

strictly do this a single in a general because different platforms use different executable the jvm thing is relying on having a jvm already installed on the destination if there is one then your jar run unless you install a jvm in a perhaps more any python packages that rely on binary extensions will not play well with jython unless specifically released in a jython which is presume that a similar situation holds for ruby though i have no direct knowledge nor even how common it is for ruby packages to use binary be able to use the whole range of java but very little in the way of also worth noting that the jvm versions of languages tend to lag behind the standard offering fewer language features and your code is pure then already as long as the destination machine already has python just as java but at least in rather less safe to assume that python is installed than to assume that java is the elements are likely to be user expectations about a reasonable installation process vary considerably across too if your app uses libraries or better include all of them for windows but users tend to be more tolerant of downloading expectations for that to be handled automatically by a package manager are if this is a application stack and you want to be able to have a bundle that can be deployed on almost any the easiest route would probably be to distribute it as a complete vmware virtual machine the player software is free at least windows and but i presume for mac as and it allows you to create a dedicated system already fully configured specifically for your say because then you need to worry about os licensing a smaller application that you want to allow to run on a existing then i suspect that compatibility will be less of a concern than compatibility while apache have a windows the vast majority of windows webservers run and having a single package distribution even single version of your that plays well with both of those webservers is likely to be

talking about streaming protocols like sip or rtsp then the way it works is that the udp port the client wants the server to send to is specified in the call set up server will send to that port and the traffic may or may not get through to the client depending on whether the nat has translated the choice of port to a different number or the server receives first udp streamed packet from the client and if it is on a different port to the one it was sending on then it will switch to this lets the udp from the server get through the nat since the client has already created the nat mapping by sending to the

the buffering inherent in all the stdio i would be tempted to read the stream character by character with a simple finite state machine can identify word and line boundaries if an advantage is the complete lack of buffers to aside from whatever buffer you collect the current word in if your further processing requires might want to do a quick benchmark comparing the time required to read a large file completely with an outside constraint requires that the file really be read a line at a time if you need to handle input from a then probably is your friend as other answers point but even then the approach may be acceptable as long as the input stream is running in mode which is common for stdin if stdin is on a to have control over the buffer on the input you might need to call or to force it to a buffered if the input stream ends up then using an explicit buffer of some form will always be faster than on a raw performance would probably use a buffer related to your disk at least two disk blocks in size and probably a lot more than even that performance can be beat by arranging the input to be a memory mapped file and relying on the paging to read and fill the buffer as you process the file as if it were one giant of the if performance is going to matter then you will want to benchmark several approaches and pick the one that works best in your and even the simplest expression of your problem may still be the best overall answer if it gets debugged and

the gcc toolchain to give you an image suitable for use directly on the hardware without an os to load it is but involves a couple of steps that normally needed for normal will almost certainly need to customize the c run time startup this is an assembly module named something like that is responsible initializing the initialized clearing the calling constructors for global objects if modules with global objects are typical customizations include the need to setup your hardware to actually address the ram including setting up the dram controller as so that there is a place to put data and some cpus need to have these things done in a specific the coldfire mcf5307 has one chip select that responds to every address after boot which eventually must be configured to cover just the area of the memory map planned for the attached hardware team you with another hat should have a memory map documenting what is at various rom at ram at device registers at in some the hardware team might only have connected a chip select from the cpu to a and leave it up to you to decide what address triggers that select ld supports a very flexible linker script language that allows the various sections of the executable image to be placed in specific address for normal you never see the linker script since a stock one is supplied by gcc that is tuned to your assumptions for a normal output of the linker is in a relocatable format that is intended to be loaded into ram by an it probably has relocation fixups that need to be and may even dynamically load some in a rom dynamic loading is not so you be doing but you still need a raw binary image in a hex format suitable for a prom programmer of some so you will need to use the objcopy utility from binutil to transform the linker output to a suitable to answer the actual question you use a linker script to specify the target addresses of each section of your in that you have several options for dealing with device but all of them involve putting the bss and heap segments in address ranges that avoid the hardware there are also mechanisms available that can make sure that ld throws an error if you overfill your rom or and you should use those as getting the device addresses into your c code can be done with as in your or by declaring a symbol directly in the linker script that is resolved to the base address of the with a matching declaration in a c header it is possible to use attribute to define an instance of an uninitialized as being located in a specific section as i have found that not to work well in real it can create maintenance and it becomes an expensive way to describe the full register map of the if you use that the linker script would then be responsible for mapping to its correct any you are going to need to get a good understanding of object file concepts such as the and bss sections at and may need to chase down details that bridge the gap between hardware and software such as the interrupt vector interrupt supervisor user modes rings 0 to 3 on x86 and the

the library is a shared object or then everything in the library is but at run the cost in extra memory is offset by sharing the library the code between all the processes in memory that use that this is a big win for something like less so for but you probably asking about shared libraries are a simply a collection of individual object each the result of a separate compilation and possibly not even written in the same source each object file has a number of exported and almost always a number of imported job is to create a finished executable that has no remaining undefined imported of if dynamic linking is but bear with to do it starts with the modules named explicitly on the link command line possibly implicitly in its and assumes that any module named explicitly must be part of the finished it then attempts to find definitions for all of the undefined the named object modules expect to get symbols from some library such as your you have a single module that calls the funtion which will result in the linker looking for module that exports say that the library named a probably offers and but you specify you implied that and do not call each which i will was built from and where each defines the corresponding single then the linker will include and ignore if included that defined both and then it will include in the satisfying the need for and including the unused function others have there are linkers that are capable of splitting individual functions out of and including only those that are actually in many that is a safe thing to but it is usually safest to assume that your linker does not do that unless you have specific else to be aware of is that most linkers make as few passes as they can through the files and libraries that are named on the command and build up their symbol table as they as a practical this means that it is good practice to always specify libraries after all of the object modules on the link command

the only time this should make much of a difference is if you have a call to a slow function in your for if you had a function that queried a value from your and returned then be much faster though they are logically because the first one can stop as soon as a simple boolean is false the query only has to run when the boolean is but the second one will run the you have a need to squeeze every possible cpu cycle out of your then those extreme cases are probably the only ones worth spending your time think of it this to make up the time you spent asking this question would probably take several billion iterations of your of all is when you have a function as a and that function has that are secretly expected by some other place in the so when you make your little the side effects only happen of the and your code breaks in weird but a bit of a the short answer to your question is but it usually

think asking how to make udp reliable may be approaching the question the wrong udp is unreliable more or less by definition ipso you going to get anywhere making the implementation of the protocol more great many applications that use udp use it because they need the nature of it much more than they need the precise reliability of but almost all of these applications still need some mechanism for verifying receipt of certain types of and perhaps even reassembly initial think about sip in voip for latent handshake and very gradual congestion control really acceptable for decent call setup time or but some way of acknowledging messages is definitely needed what provisional responses are in sip or various protocols in use by online games same basic is very likely that the real intent of the assignment even if is not stated clearly is not so much to make reliable as to create a simple program that udp has some primitive reliability abstraction layer within its own communication encapsulated in udp as it

think confusing your operator precedence and of you want to say in c the has a higher so your expression as it is and or my speed is lower than you have an extra pair of which suggests that you intended to prioritize things mention that code that has a bunch of similar looking if statements is fairly poorly a better way to implement it would be either with tables or data structures to represent the or at least a better that posted the it really looks like working too hard on of if or switch based on year should only be about 4 for each call a separate function to do the that will already be return return know but there should be some sort of switch you can manage each year your conditions are in an ascending order of you could do something return return return return is still far from but it will already be a lot cleaner and looking at your it looks like you even need that many you are paying 50 why not just calculate the diff and then just return the result of the know just guessing at the

think of any particular way other than sendkeys to do exactly what you asked take his warnings to sendkeys is very tricky to do possibility to get the same end result is to change your to accept get variables and its fields on you might have 3 variables that populate the company and in vba create a form or sheet that a user can fill out var1 obviously make your var names nicer than mine myurl myurl myurl have a as use something similar for help pages called via a menu and it works a a user clicks a menu and vba opens a url with some data in the favourite only other way interacted with a website from vba programatically is by making calls to directly for get and post though think it would help in your last if you want to stop people gaming your site your should encrypt your not to hard to encrypt then uuencode the data and send that as a request then just urldecode it and decrypt it on the server using the same algorythm you used to encrypt

think that a 5 times speed improvement is not all that important for me is not an order of magnitude although if you consume cpu power at the scale of google it can be a worth while investment to have some of your staff work on of the speed improvements will likely make it into cpython rid of the gil is interesting in principle but will likely reveal lots of problems with modules that are not thread safe once the gil is do not think i will use unladen swallow any time soon but like how giving attention to performance may improve the regular python	
think that has any sort of xmlchar data in you will generally use an which just uses are you perhaps thinking of in that simply defined as an representing a octet help the compiler give warnings if you try to cast it to a you can generally treat an like a regular as long as you keep in mind that encoded rather than in ascii truncating it may give invalid comparing values to sort them work unless you implement	
think that i can explain this there is a better explanation somewhere in one of either or but i feel like i believe what you are seeing is a consequence of how virtual functions are implemented and the pay for it until you use nature of there are no virtual methods in then a pointer to the object points to the as soon as a virtual method is the compiler inserts a virtual lookup table and the pointer points to this probably missing something my brain working since i could not get this to occur until i inserted a data member in the base if the base class has a data member and the first child class has a then the offsets differ by the size of the vtable on my an example that shows this t this a char void a virtual void virtual void b virtual void a b c return this on my machine prints the this this this this this this this interesting thing is that both and exhibit the address change as between calling methods on and or the difference is that contains a virtual this allows the compiler to insert the additional table necessary to implement function the other interesting thing that this program shows is that and is different in when it is called you can also see a size increase using as soon as the virtual table is your as soon as you made the vtable is inserted and it actually pays attention to real type of the object as well as inserting the bookkeeping structures this causes the offset to the base of the object to i really wish that i could find the reference that describes a mythical memory layout and why the address of an object is dependent on the type that it is being interpreted as when inheritance is mixed into the you have heard this classes always have virtual this will help eliminate little surprises like

think that you can use exceptions for flow there a flipside of this creating exceptions is a costly because they have to create a stack so if you want to use exceptions more often than for just signalling an exceptional situation you have to make sure that building the stack traces negatively influence your best way to cut down the cost of creating exceptions is to override the method like throwable return an exception will have no stacktraces filled

think the problem you encounter is due to the way you add the commandbutton in the jsf component to be more the way uou do not add it in the component you do not attach the commandbutton to the jsf component when this component is rendered your call to it does not find the form where this component is the html input is not created you can try to add the commandbutton created to the form before asking it to be you can do that with the following search for the component htmlform that is a parent of the current uicomponent uicomponent parent while instanceof parent return void throws ioexception htmlajaxcommandbutton replycommentbutton new add the command button in the form that contains your custom uicomponent form if that tested this so maybe you have to modify it a it still maybe you will need to review you code in order to create the commandbutton outside the render class or outside the i think it is a good idea to modify the jsf components tree during the rendering

think there is anything wrong with using exceptions for exceptions are somewhat similar to continuations and in statically typed exceptions are more powerful than if you need continuations but your language have you can use exceptions to implement if you need continuations and your language have you chose the wrong language and you should rather be using a different but sometimes you have a web programming is prime just no way to get around is a project to allow writing web applications in and let the framework take care of figuring out which bits need to run one consequence of this is that volta needs to be able to compile cil to so that you can run code on the there is a has javascript volta implements continuations in javascript using javascript then implements threads using those that volta applications that use threads can be compiled to run in an unmodified no silverlight

this is an issue between the browser and the flash as sifr inserts the flash movies into the the browser initializes the flash plugin with the path to the flash if the movie is not yet in a local requested from the since the movies are inserted within a few this would mean that a request is made for each inserted tries to prevent this by prefetching the flash it does this ones per browser based on a session this merely fires off a request for the movie and hopefully that file is in the cache by the time replacement therefore its important to load the sifr javascript code as early as and to activate sifr properly by passing the flash movies to the my experience the only way to reliably test this process is clearing browser closing all browser instances get rid of the session then opening the browser and going straight to the page you want to i find the activity monitors within browsers so either check through an http proxy or the server one remaining improvement i could make is to try and detect the progress of the and hold off on replacing elements until the prefetch is

this is not possible in with a bit of wickedness more clarification on unfortunately a bit i assume should read one should note that this approach will strip whitespaces from the dragonfly that reads characters which can be anything except the newline character the second part of the specifier rejects anything why the character is if the line has more than characters upto but including the newline the newline character tells to stop what if we did as dragonfly the only problem is will not know where to stop and will keep suppressing assignment until the next newline is hit is another match for the first hence you will trail by one line of input when if you wanted to read in a a little modification is we need to add a to consume the unmatched the maxline stringify these work only in so keep both char maxline 1 wickedness we read from to the format specifier is the only tricky we bite off more than we can chew hence the specification of maximum number of chars width has to go into a so we stringify it using the careful reader will observe that once we read maxline characters we discard the rest upto including a int n if while n if return

this question is certainly going to open up to some interesting in reply i quote the oft used small companies this might just be simply a matter of being the developers are also likely to be the most technically so it makes sense for them to adminster their own a fan of the which can be used when necessary noticed this approach was very similar in principal to uac later you are developing desktop software not a bad idea for developers to work within the confines that their end will experience limited or restricted if you build the software under limited a good chance that hit the same problems your target users would face given the same set of said if you have a good testing lab a decent qa team this might be a moot point especially if you have a half decent alm finally i develop without mainly because i trust myself and my in a team put it to a in larger organizations you might not have this the enterprise admins often have the final say

took me about 4 months of fulltime work hours a to build a working provider that implements the entire spec of i would say i had a very buggy and unstable version after about three so if just looking for something rough i would say probably looking at anything from a week up to two months depending on how good you are and what types of requiements you must point you to the wayward blog for matt has written a really good walkthrough on how to implement a linq and even if probably not going to be able to copy and it will help you to get to grips with how to think when you can find walkthrough i recommend you go about it the same way matt and extend the expression tree visitor matt includes in the second part of his when i began working with i had so much help from the expression tree it really made parsing a whole lot easier once you could see how linq parsed to a provider is really a lot of even if a bit frustrating at i wish you all the best of

ui is time consuming and because it involves not just visual or sound but more importantly interaction a good api is always interaction model meaning it puts minimal constraints on actual localisation and info the main driver behind this is encapsulation and code a result it is impossible to extract enough information from api alone to construct a good user interface tailored to a specific case of api there are ui generators that normally produce screens based on a given needless to say that such generated are not very for frequent users with demands for higher ui nor are they particularly easy to learn in case of a larger system since they really communicate system image or interaction sequence takes a lot of effort to create a good ui because it needs to be designed according to specific user needs and not because of some mundane conversion task that can be fully speed the process of building ui up and mitigate risks it is possible to suggest either involving ui professionals or learning more about the job there is no shortcut or magic so to speak that will produce a quality ui based entirely and only on an api without lots of additional info and also see an excellent is good ui design so hard for some that has some very insightful and valuable plug for own by karl

variant of option 2 hybrid of 1 and may make after polymorphism is the standard solution to are as but need to behave differently in situation a method would probably tie the model to the ui too but presumably the different renderings you want at the ui level reflect semantic or behavioural differences at the model could those be captured in a for instead of an outright could it be a to which a and b return different values but it is still up to the ui to decide how to translate that into a your more general of can we handle behaviour that we or allow to be accessed polymorphically via the base for example if the base class under our your options are probably option the visitor pattern or a helper in both cases you are effectively farming out the polymorphism to an external entity in option the ui the presenter or which performs an instanceof check and does different things depending on whether a b or in visitor or the helper the new given your visitor is probably overkill if you were not to change the base class to accommodate it be possible to implement it i so suggest a simple class called something like abstract class renderer public static renderer if instanceof return new return new public abstract color implementations of arenderer and brenderer per your ui encapsulates the type checking and bundles the code up into reasonably classes with clear without the conceptual overhead of if your hierarchy or function set is more complex than what shown visitor could well be more but many people find visitor hard to get their heads around and i would tend to avoid it for simple situations but your mileage may

very much doubt c will be faster than perl unless you were to the i mean coding the finite state machine directly rather than using the re engine to compile this approach means you can optimize it for your specific case which can often be faster than relying on the more not something ever suggest to anyone who had to write compilers or parsers before without the benefit of bison or other similar generalized such as are usually powerful and fast enough my needs and those needs have often been using a general re it needs to be able to handle all sorts of cases whether written in c or when you think about which is you only have to compare what the re engines are written in for both cases the perl re engine is written in both written in c so you should find very little difference in terms of the matching find differences in the support code around the res but that will be especially if a simple

well tried to solve that problem i wasted two month on a solution that tried to solve the zero overdraw as already found out you deal with all degenerated cases and have zero overdraw at the same can however use a hybrid yourself a routine that checks if the joins can be constructed from simple geometry without to do so you have to check the the width of the line and the length of the joined that are shorter than their width are a with some heuristics you should be able to sort out all the trivial know how your average looks but in my case more than of the wide lines had no degenerated all other most probably already found out that if you tolerate generating the geometry is a lot do and let a polygon csg algorithm and a tesselation algorithm do the hard evaluated most of the available tesselation and i ended up with the glu it was never crashed most other it was free and the license allowed me to include it in a commercial the quality and speed of the tesselation is you will not get delaunay triangulation but since you just need the triangles for rendering not a i disliked the tesselator api i lifted the tesselation code from the free sgi opengl reference rewrote the entire and added memory pools to get the number of allocations it took two days to do but it was well worth it factor five performance the solution ended up in a commercial openvg implementation btw rendering with opengl on a you may want to move the from the cpu to the gpu and use or tricks to remove the a lot easier and may be even faster than cpu

with firebug that all the post data is being sent from the page via the i agree with you need to increment the on the cloned elements so they are would suggest you look into jquery for dynamically creating html i have only just started learning jquery and its very following code demonstrates a simple file upload form that allows the user can add more input elements each time the jquery adds a new input i append a chr to the id attribute so they are all hopefully this helps script block for the notice the last part is for the ajax the actual copying code is only those 4 lines from var counter var the aspnet string posturl 0 for upload must not exceed more all only boils down to a few lines of html and	
with marc and unkown above 6 indexes in the clustered index is way too especially on a table that has only 14 you have more than 3 or if i would say 1 or maybe you may know that the clustered index is the actual table on the disk so when a record is the database engine must sort it and place it in sorted organized place on the non clustered indexes are they are supporting lookup my vldbs are laid out on the disk according to the 1st point your clustered index to 1 or the best field choices are the identity if you have or a date field in which the fields are being added to the or some other field that is a natural sort of how your data is being added to the the point is you are trying to keep that data at the bottom of the table or have it laid out on the disk in the best way that read the records this makes it so that there is no reorganzing going on or that taking one and only one hit to get the data in the right place for the best be sure to put the removed fields into indexes so you lose the lookup i have never put more than 4 fields on my if you have fields that are being update frequently and they are included in your clustered going to reorganize the record on the disk and cause costly the fillfactor on your the larger the fill factor number the more full the data pages and index pages will in relation to how many records you have and how many records your are inserting you will change the fillfactor or of your indexes to allow for the fill space when a record is if you change your clustered index to a sequential data then this matter as much on a clustered rule of thumb fillfactor for high for medium and for high by dropping your fillfactor to will mean that for every 100 records on a 70 records are which will leave free space of 30 records for new or reorganized eats up more but it sure beats having to defrag every night 4 sure the statistics exist on the if you want to sweep the database to create statistics using the then sql server will create all the statistics on all the indexes that the engine has accumulated as requiring leave off the attribute though or add statistics for every that would then not be the using dbcc showcontig to see which indexes are getting fragmented the i go into the details just know that you need to do then based on that change the fillfactor up or down in relation to the changes the indexes are experiencing change and how fast a job schedule that will do online or offline on individual indexes to defrag do dbcc dbreindex on this large of a table without it being during maintenance time cause it will bring the apps down especially on the clustered been test and test this the execution plans to see what and fat pipes exist and adjust the then defrag and rewrite stored procs to get rid of those hot if you see a red object in your execution because there are not statistics on that this step is more of the than the off peak run the update statistics with fullscan to give the query engine as much information about the data distributions as you otherwise do the standard update statistics standard on tables during the weeknights or more often as you see fit with your observerations to make sure the engine has more information about the data distributions to retrieve the data for this is so but extremely only give you here minimal information but will help a some gut feelings and observations that go in to strategies used by these points that will require your time and need to go to enterprise i did though in order to get the features spoken of earlier with but i did especially to have much better capabilities with searching and online defraging and maintenance in enterprise it is much much better and more friendly with standard edition handle doing dbcc indexdefrag with online databases as

worked on medium and large sized projects and i say ever seen risk reviews done less than once per fortnight two in some cases they were performed once per month twice a month would be my key to risk management is to allow enough time to pass before you project this gives a project manager enough time to evaluate whether contingencies and migitation are valid and to allow the team time to decide whether risks are more or less likely and whether risk mitigation techniques have lessened the impact of any recorded also need to allocate enough time for individuals who have been assigned ownership of one or more to evaluate and report back on mitigation in other strength is through routine review but enough time must pass for it to be obviously this the sort of task which should be constrained to a rigid if it becomes you could schedule risk reviews closer together to suit the needs of the project if move to weekly reviews and then scale back during stabilization important thing is not to let the or to stop new i missed another aspect of the how to handle the risk to the team other stakeholders a basic say that you need the ability to record risk items and to weigh them according to probability and estimated and also to be able to assign them to various team members version control is critical you do this will vary depending on the nature of your there are plenty of ways to track the information for example which can be emailed to external a sharepoint list someone a must take ownership of the process so it get might want to avoid email since it has a habit of not being stored or recorded

would not use selenium for this type of test and suggest that you solve a variety of testing issues with different what we do unit tests to test methods and tests to test how application components hang simple functional test framework like canoo webtest some to assert things like http cache basic page simple redirection and cookie setting tests to ensure validity of pages to w3c to test javascript classes and methods we created to test ui and the integration of those worth spending time breaking out the responsibility of testing different aspects of the system using these different tools since using only selenium can cause bigger the the slower they indeed selenium is inherently slower compared to the other tools handles testing well but nevertheless xpaths can be brittle and may require increasing amounts of time and effort to requires you setup data with your app to step through user scenarios can be messy and take a lot of are also some techniques which you may or may not have come across which you can use to make your selenium tests

would say definately would look ping commands between the two servers and see if there are any the servers are next to each other you should have 1 on the could be network traffic network cards not being configured for or other things some analysis on some queries and see if you can identify indexes or locking which might be a problem if any of the selects on the read database might be blocking the with and see if this makes a difference on one or two queries you have a complicated system which you have a problem you need to determine which component is the problem and fix replication is probably best if the reports selects you need to run need to be up to if they you could look at log although that would add some down time with each make sure on seperate drives so the performance is
