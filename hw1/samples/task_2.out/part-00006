am about to port a windows 32 bit application to 64 but might decide to port the whole thing to linux code contains sections which are dependent on the amount of memory available to the application depends on whether creating a 32 or 64 bit while the ability to compile a 32 bit version of the code should be preserved for backward i am able to simply wrap the respective code sections into preprocessor statements to ensure the right version of the code is i have very few experience on programming on the linux so the question am i able to identify a 64 bit build on the linux there any preprocessor define i might check for in to identify a 64 bit build on linux using the	
am asking from a i can imagine a scenario with two required private keys needed for decryption scenarios that may make this an attractive this is to settle an my vote is that it is not adding any additional security other than having to compromise two different private i think that if it was any more secure than encrypting it one million times would be the best way to secure informaiton and i buy so i guess my question becomes is a two locking mechanism equivalent to another one locking mechanism with a single forgive me if the answer is obvious but my bread goes dead as i read books on the there any benefit to encrypting twice using	
am becoming more and more addicted to the project euler however since one week i am stuck with the is a short version of the is totient for any given integer of for which can iterate to create a for example starting from starting from 18 we get a chain of length 4 problem is to calculate the sum of all primes less than 40e6 which generate a chain of length built a function that calculates the chain length of any number and i tested it for it works well and of all which generate a chain of length 12 of all which generate a chain of length my algorithm scale when i apply it to the it takes several hours to so i stop it because the project euler problems must be solved in less than one thought that my prime detection function might be slow so i fed the program with a list of primes to avoid the primality the code runs now a little bit but there is still no way to get a solution in less than a few hours i want is there any that i am missing here i really understand how to be more efficient on this am not asking for the because fighting with optimization is all the fun of project any small hint that could put me on the right track would be the formatting of the comment is wrong and i delete so here it is calculate the totient i use the a given call p the list of are factors of 18 18 6 in this way i calculate any the function that gives me the factors is built in matlab i forgot to mention that i code in maybe i should rewrite the factorization euler how can i make it more	
am building a annotation where end users can select and annotate a section of text from an html programmatically accessing and working with the selected text and corresponding range is straightforward using and am running into a when i try to put all of this together in a everything works find in but in safari i noticed immediately that when i click on an html button the the current user text selection goes as if clicking on the button repositioned the text my code that attempts to access the executes from a script in this which then reports that no selection dug in and took a look at how google specifically their application handles as essentially the behavior and mechanics of selecting text and clicking or corresponds to my annotation in google they load the text of the document to be edited into an playing around with i learned that firefox supports multiple selection ranges in a web page that contains multiple or in other i can select a section of text in the base and a separate section of text in the iframe without the first selection this google docs solution works for both firefox and safari two browsers that interested but when i built a simple example page to test this it would not work in as soon as i click a button or make text selection in the root page of the the current iframe selected text goes know what missing here to get this to or have a suggestion on another way to get this to to support multiple text selections cross	
am building a teensy tiny little twitter client on the displaying the tweets in a and they are of course of varying dynamically changing the height of the cell based on the text quite cgfloat height buffer return nsstring get tweet text for this return displaying the actual tweet cell using the algorithm in the pragprog static nsstring tweetcell if cell tweet set other return i boot all the tweets visible display just when i scroll the tweets below are quite mussed up it appears that once a cell has scrolled off the the cell height for the one above it gets resized to be larger than it should and obscures part of the cell below when the cell reaches the top of the it resets itself and renders scrolling up presents no is a video that shows this in tried quite a bit resizing the frame on using different identifiers for cells with different heights changing properties in interface there are additional code snippets i can please let me thanks in advance for your with dynamic cell heights what do i need to do to fix scrolling	
am building a web site with and most of the site structure is static enough to create a folder structure and aspx the site administrators want the ability to add new pages to different sections of the site through a web interface and using a wysiwyg i am using nested master pages to give the different sections of the site their own what i would like to do is have a generic page under each section of the site that uses the appropriate master page and has a place holder for content that could be loaded from a i would also like these pages to have a url like any other aspx as if they had corresponding files on the so rather than have my url would be something problem is that does not because the administrator created it through the web and the content is stored in the what thinking is that implement an http handler that handles requests for aspx in that check to see if the url that was requested is an actual file or one of my if it is a request for a fake the request to the generic content page for the appropriate change the query string to request the appropriate data from the and rewrite the url so that it looks to the user as if the fake page really the problem having right now is that i figure out how to route the request to the default handler for aspx i tried to instantiate a but the constuctor is protected is there any way for me to tell my httphandler to call the httphandler that would normal be used to process a my handler code currently looks like public class fakepagehandler public bool get return public void reroute the request to the generic page and rewrite the pagehandlerfactory factory new this compile because the constructor is protected route the request to the default handler for aspx pagehandlerfactory factory new public string public string public string still have some work to do to determine if the request is for a real and i rewritten any urls but is something like this is there another way to create a pagehandlerfactory other than calling its is there any way i can route the request up to the httphandler for an aspx basically be saying this aspx request as you normally i use httphandler to fake the existence of aspx

am going refer to the example in the wikipedia article problem is most examples code property values in to concrete which i really should come from a i the idea was to send my choices to director a data and the builder create a product based on my this case you would have class implementing pizzabuilder that knows how to retrieve data from a you can do it several would be make a when the class initializes it queries the database for a hawaiian pizza and retrieves the then when the various methods are called it would set the properties to the corresponding field of the retrieved database would be just makes a pizzadatabasebuilder and make sure that when you initialize the class you pass it the id of the row you need for that type of for example instead new new problem is i want the builder methods to actually create then assign them to the not pass strings but real typed product not be an what you need is an other type pattern to initialize the fields of the for of public override void would do something public override void new public override void new can go to another table in your database to properly fill out a pizzadough

answer depends on the order you need them you pretty much have a choice of and thus have obvious analogues in breadth first and depth first and in general have trouble beating if you constraint the problem a there are a number of old fashioned algorithms for storing trees of arbitrary data as we used them a lot in the fortran one of them had the key trick being to store the children of say a2 and at the problem is that if your tree is sparse you waste and the size of your tree is limited by the array if i remember this you get the elements in order by simple do a look at knuth volume there is a ton of that stuff in

answer to your question has to do with the type of your if your application is mainly around communicating with the hardware and only a thin layer of business logic and user interface is then would be a better to interact with the scanners you need to talk to a this is better and faster achieved with the sdk will actually be a wrapper of code using a ton of which makes the code performing less on the other side your application requires a significant business layer a user then specifically is a better in that case the productivity gains far out weight the performance gains of important factor is the type of the devices the application is going to be deployed are you targeting windows mobile devices then is a safe for windows ce devices you need to investigate whether the compact framework is or some windows ce devices may not support all i recommend reading architecture pocket which is a recent document about architectural decisions for mobile

been doing all my work in git and pushing to been very happy with both the software and the site and i have no wish to change my working practices at this phd adviser is asking all students to keep their work in an svn repository hosted at the found tons of documentation and tutorials about to pull down an existing svn repo into but nothing about pushing a git repo to a fresh svn i expect there must be some way to do this with a combination of and a fresh branch and rebasing and all those wonderful but a git newbie and feel confident with any of then want to just run a couple of commands to push commits to that svn repo when i i wish to keep using git and just have the svn repo mirror in be the only person ever committing to if this makes any instructions on how to do this would be very much an existing git repository to	
been experimenting with the remotesoft linker and mini deployment tools to create a single native executable need the framework from my managed one of the configurable features it has is if is available for the final the documentation for it says that typically only needed if using xml serialization modified my build process to use sgen to create the serialization and added the result to the references of each project in the solution that uses my xml the serialization classes are making it into the linked executable dlls combined into a single managed so i assume i have that configured my app still attempts to execute csc when it am i doing something wrong with the serialization resulting in it being recreated at or is my app doing something else that requires and how do i determine done some testing with a modified to keep the serialization files visible if generated by undoing the build time and it appears that i did have them properly created unless a different part of the framework that invokes csc at runtime and which has its results unhidden using a different flag i think the remotesoft tool is probably to i be certain though because the output executable leave any temps it creates visible even if the file it injested told it i used was elsewhere i saw examples using a value of but been able to find any difference between their is my application using csc during

been tackling similar problems and found a couple of solutions that emk can link to external sql data sources so you can use odbc to connect to a mysql database and share you can find more information we tried it and found it to be pretty slow to be is a product that claims to allow you to perform data replication and data transmission between mysql and other structured is possible to use web as a web service that your app can then push and pull data we found a couple of wrappers for this in and can put a trigger in the filemaker database so that every time a record is changed part of a record you are interest you can call a web service that updates a mysql or memcached version of that data that your website can found that people like filemaker because it gives them a very visual interface onto their data very easy to make quite large applications without too much development when it comes to collaboration with many users or presenting this data in a format other than the filemaker application we found performance a real

been wondering how to efficiently do this am not sure if this will do the but seems to do what you although you probably want to examine to see how it achieves this as there are some inefficient ways to do thought would be to have the dreaded boolean flag on your models and then creating a custom manager that automatically adds the filter although this work for searches across different yet another solution is to have duplicate models of which seems like but may work for the comments there also discuss different will add that for the most part i consider any of these solutions worth the i usually just suck it up and filter my searches on the boolean it avoids many issues that can come up if you try to get too it is a pain and not very of a reasonable solution would be a mixture of the custom manager while being aware of its limitations if you try searching a related model through

believe that a magic if all the predicates make sense then i will put them this might involve splitting the if statement over two but i usually never introduce extra if statements that are but if it is particularly you should ask yourself if all the statements are really perhaps you could filter out some of the values earlier or something like the biggest concern is if it is hard for someone else to you need to refactor your but splitting up the code into two different if statements rarely makes the code more it just takes up more

believe the java stack is actually very there are a few reasons explaining the low productivity of java enterprise it is often used to create applications in tend not to attract great who love and think and care about what they the quality of software in the enterprise world is not the enterprise stack where the money software vendors try to sell something to they create complex and expensive solutions not because they are but simply because they could sell them to are often very risk averse and everything they do better be standards are created either some technology proved to be successful or in both bad for enterprises enterprises end up using either good technology too late or a downright failed the latter case is also very dangerous because it creates a false perception that a technology a complete must be good if it is standardized and everyone is using java ee platform seemed to have attracted a lot of architecture astronauts and developers in big companies promoted to architects whose only purpose was to create more more more abstractions and more not that there are no good java tools and that there are too many bad too many too many bureaucratic processes and too many useless such a messy world not just the particular selection of tools you choose that affects your mainly about about your about how you can reject the majority of solutions proposed to you by the and about you going against the about common about questioning every mainstream belief and tools alone are not going to change your productivity and the right people can be productive with inferior tools use a technology only because because everyone uses or because officially recommended by use a technology only if you personally think the best tool for your this way you may find yourself rejecting technologies such as web it use your common question do you really need to publish your objects for remote do you really need to create another abstraction layer so that you can switch from hibernate to do you really need to convert your data xml ten times every time you need do you really need xml do you really need everything to be configurable are at by the process be do you really need that do you really need to describe every screen in a huge have it type it in to some tool and then generate do you have competent programmers or you design everything first and programmers only to design of html programming in general this includes as and as programming drawing page flow code generation is a framework prior to using always a frameworks that have only little xml for low loc look at actual in your is every character what can you do to make your code do you need that what does it why do you need to do is not sacred you need 100 test test only what makes if difficult to make it or test it at test visual some concrete java presentation layer try why do i love because with tapestry you can create beautiful designed specifically for so that code can be by beautiful i mean everything that matters easy to easy to easy to create your and still it try to hide the fact that you are developing for the of still who makes your code free to use especially for crud and large bother with not a silver bullet with orm you are always going to trade one set of problems with a little you need much since carefully avoided all the java ee use dependency injection all of you may find the java language too verbose and not very helpful when abstracting away you if you want to try the problem is that the main selling point of scala is that you get all the benefits of modern languages while still keeping type and at the same there is no ide being used to java it make much sense to switch to scala unless an ide support that is stable and stable enough is not	
believe the only person to run up against this been googling for hours and have not had any the java security documentation seem to address pkcs12 certificates am trying to setup java for user specific pkcs12 among other this will be used so in i can access a trac server that is authenticated via i am using the trac mylyn integration plugin for is the home directories are at mount at user has a personal certificate for personal certificates users password is stored in a 0400 file at trust store for the ca is password for the installed at installed at is set to the jdk location because eclipse needs lives at user has a is a trac server running at trac server authenticates using i want to be able to have each user simply modify some file that they own the for and be able to launch the central eclipse application and access the trac seems simple the only way i can get this to work is to edit the file and add that but there are two problems with user has to have their own ecipse can eclipse read that from a user is eclipse ultimately like to have this as a java i remember from some time back that you can edit the file and eclipse seem to pick that could it be because my points to a and not the nested seen the that references the following was another reference i saw that said you could edit the file to that get picked up maybe it actually does work and its not getting read for the same reason the file or maybe it just work at system properties right i guess stuck with having each user to have their own eclipse i know it sounds like a complicated but this really have anything to do with eclipse as far as the certificate its really a java setup for user specific to set up java to use user specific certificates for

best practices start with locking everything then only opening up pieces as necessary to the people that actually need to get to allowing the access to even regardless of the fact that they have rights to do opens the door just a enough to exploit a buffer overflow or another type of login and a user are two different a login is server a user is database every user should have a corresponding but not every login will have a database user say you are using active directory integrated and assigned a particular ad group to have access to the only some of those within the group may actually have access to certain those are the people you want to allow access to whereas the other members of the group have regular database user definition this is a problem as some of the group members can connect and list databases on the server even though they have access to any of those the in the door talking you can stop those people from even being able to connect then gone a long way towards securing your are other server level permissions that the public role grants to if you should turn it off just like you would a guest

best you should use what you put into your distance filter depends on up with which faults willing to going to have to make decisions based on accuracy vs that during periods when a answer is not what will you approach is to let the phone deliver answers using a projection of what was happening the last time you had see if what you have makes suppose jogging at 6mph to the you plot me along then you get a answer look at the spot where it says i am and figure out i have gotten to that spot from if continued along my current making reasonable adjustments for possible changes in if then the new point is within the realm of then toss it then project from at my speed and figure out where you think i probably save that as using the accelerometer to get some sort of inertial sense of which way i you know direction know what way the phone is but you can make a reasonable stab at all this plot the most likely spot where you think i probably when just drive in coverage see how your app performs out in the away from cell a lot of people like to bike jog those

biggest one would be using existing 3rd party controls on your most of the inbuilt controls are pretty easy to but if you have a pet 3rd party you might have to host that on a regular aspx page this is the feature where uses different html for different clients you want to do this by but in reality most clients now work with standard so it is less of an issue in the first things like i18n via resx files need extra work than is in the vanilla mvc but the samples are there on the mvc is licensed only for so one thing you do violating the as i understand is to run it in but consider the things you do with that you are with instead of input resolution html jquery etc for simple of templating options just input actionresult pick and off the or form so you have to spend lots of time picking out request templates the only templating for see or you can write your own if you the view is not tied to controls	
biggest problem going from single development to a group was to not work on the same files at the same i use but when you check in and there is a conflict because someone else also modified the file you checked that was a learning up with rules of who can modified which and when to fix bugs right or discuss them and other you want to have a junior programmer modifying the core alone you could change the knowing it would break a few but you could fix working in a you know if your change will break someone

broadly that when you x in loop body goes the python is doing something like i x loop body goes i you insert for the loop perhaps then be able to see why you get the result you python uses a moving pointer to traverse the the pointer starts by pointing at the first then you remove the first thus making the element the new first then the pointer move to the new second previously third and so might be clearer if you use instead of as your sample	
buffering a request is not really something you can can consider staggering a user request for data over a set of http parsing and processing each http request as it comes if the user wishes to request records 1 to the client could first request records 1 to parse and render then request records 101 to 200 and so the first 100 records would display relatively quickly after a short the next 100 records would so long as the second 100 records displays before the user has managed to deal with the first 100 records it should be the overall time to complete the request will be however the web app will appear more responsive and the perceived task completion time will be should also consider switching from xml to json if not just updating the innerhtml property of an element with display to the user the response to an ajax the response must first be parsed into a data structure and then the parse time for both xml and json is pretty much the the difference lies in the time required to traverse and read the resulting data functions for traversing and accessing the data within the dom of a parsed response are relatively browser dom api methods mask the complexity of what is involved in dom traversing and make a slow process look nice and data in javascript objects resulting from the parsing of a response is much traversing a javascript object is easily 2 to 3 times faster than traversing a dom tree for the same set of recent tests i carried out with firefox beta 2 using 10mb of source traversing the dom of an xml response took about 30 doing the same for a javascript object populated from the same original large data set took about 15

concerns are been taking the approach of it fix and leaving existing web services alone until they need for new development we have been adopting wcf the solution to communication problems big and the most tangible benefit is the ease of integration if you have a nice clean object the most tangible negative is that there are much more configuration especially when you start trying to secure find it interesting you mentioned the spec as that is where we had the most problems integrating wcf with a java the security features are just plain missing right and we ended up using for that one piece of the side of would highly recommend through these even if you do security with wcf right you probably will have to at some	
condone using a language in a manner that suited for being able to write code in a given language the same thing as being able to write code in the style of that your style match the language then a good indicator that you are making things much more difficult than need there is a certain amount of validity to maintaining ways when dealing with a mature application which is built in a backwards consistency provides maintainability and if a team works on a project and everybody injects their own style or approach then the project becomes a maintenance have to carefully balance the cost of adding a new coding style to an existing however if you are starting a new project then you have a clean slate to implement enforcing coding standards is a good but you have to be able to get a mediator to on the requirement before you can demand it of your

couple of people have mentioned syntax as a hindrance to i think a particular issue that drives a large number of developers lack of algebraic precedence language where the expression 2 3 4 has the value 20 going to be a commercial the syntax is very and anybody who knows smalltalk can figure out why expressions are evaluated the way they it runs counter to what had drilled into you during your entire primary education in learning smalltalk and is trying to use it to do basically any kind of calculation at all will run into this problem repeatedly until they learn that they have to parenthesize because only a problem with some and causes incorrect rather than an error take them a long time to figure out the first n times it significant percentage of developers will never get over

create the which can be links or images or now hook a javascript function up to each click on the function fires a request to the server code that more or or code takes this will vary wildly depending on what framework you use and a bunch of other connects to the database and runs a query to or the how this happens will vary wildly depending on your database but be something like posts set where id on what the database the server returns a success code or a failure code as the ajax request gets sent to js response function updates the score if a success displays an error if a store the code in a but this is complicated and depends on how well you know the semantics of your runtime it eventually needs to be pushed to persistent storage so using the database is a good initial when the time for optimizing performance there are enough software in the world to cache database queries to make you feel woozy so not that big a

currently researching methods for storing user roles and permissions for based some of these projects are web some are currently struggling to find the best method to achieve what looking for in a portable way across project looking to leverage active directory as our single point of contact for basic user because of looking to not have to maintain a custom database for each users since they are already stored in active directory and actively maintained we want to write our own security if possible and would like to use something like the security application blocks provided by projects require only basic such as or no other projects require more complex users of those applications might be granted access to some but not and their permissions can change across each an administration section of the app would control and define this the ad using integrated windows authentication to perform authentication on our this works well for finding out basic user and seen that can be extended to provide an active directory roles so i can find out any security groups a user belongs what seems like the downfall of this method to me is that everything is stored in active which could lead to a mess to maintain if things grow too this same also heard of active directory lightweight directory which seems like it could extend our schema and add only application specific attributes and problem i find anything on how this would be done or how this there are msdn articles that describe how to talk to this instance and how to create a new but nothing ever seems to answer my question based on your am i going down the right is what looking to do possible using just active or do other tools have to be methods looked multiple files a custom security model and database to manage users across group and role management in with active

default setting for is so by expanding and collapsing of nodes should be happening client note the remarks for that property though the enableclientscript property to specify whether the treeview control renders script on compatible browsers to handle expanding and collapsing when this property is set to compatible browsers execute the code to expand and collapse nodes on the tree node data must be known in advance for the script to using client script prevents a post back to the server each time a node is expanded or to do have the node data avaiable to the tree view data source without a set enableclientscript to not using a control adaptor overriding this somehow confusing the server into thinking that a page is running on i so might be different to your server it treats my version of ie with an overweight useragent string as because the check cuts off after 128 and you have all the data then you should ensure that you are setting and to no reason why you do what attempting to do with a tree view control it should do most of this for you unless you supplying the whole tree up in which case need to supply the methods that will populate the nodes through populatenodesfromclient and assuming the browser is recognised correctly previous links have examples of both with and without jquery tree view plugins will probably be more flexible not used them so i know i have used the treeview control but was getting the features because i only had a small and was supplying all the data up but will require a bit more work to set need to pull in the jquery if not already using a web service that it can call to get the initial data along with subsequent worry about what happens to browsers with limited or no javascript may or may not be the kicker for you in everything we we try to use javascript to enhance not provide the functionality as the jquery library is all client if the browser support your jquery treeview control and possibly be losing a key navigational whereas a server control like the treeview control will notice that javascript supported and resolve this for you by falling back to a server based version of the should also remember that jquery a microsoft thing they do now and has been around for quite some and as a client side it works independantly of the server technology ms give us a number of controls within the framework that we use if we want and doing so can make our lives easier in the short term but we have to a prime example is the recently released mvc which is a different way of building web applications on iis using the stack but generally without the server

enum is can avoid casting from your type and constrain the values that can be explicitly cast to your type by making a sealed and providing conversion an implicit operator for converting from your type to a generic int so you have to an explicit operator for converting from an int to your which throws an error if the integer fails to meet the such as 0 x using this create a generic immutable base class such as which has a constructor that accepts a t value and delegate for the bool the constructor should run the value through the constraint and throw an exception if it fails to meet the the base class should also take care of the implicit conversion operation to and should handle equality by overloading and defining and operators for the type and implementing and i also recommend defining an copy constructor for the base and all derived cloning can then be implemented cleanly in the base class by retrieving the copy constructor via but this is entirely you can figure out the implementation unless already posted it on stackoverflow can provide named static readonly values in your derived so that you can access them just like an sealed class public static readonly constraint 0 x public static readonly returnvalue success new public static readonly returnvalue failreason1 new public static readonly returnvalue failreason2 new private int value constraint private returnvalue original base be used to support iclonable implementation in base public static explicit operator int value to return an existing instance is more efficient than creating a new one and the constraint when there is a limited number of allowed if the constraint was more such as an even then you would instead return a new instance and make your constructors case return case return case return throw new fails to meet the constraint defined for could use this technique for any for a class called evennumber may have a constraint that returns true if the given number is in that just make your constructors and simplify your static conversion operator to just return a new instead of switching to return one of the limited existing could be used like x y exception fails to meet the constraint defined for a enum would stupidly allow such a creating an invalid breaking the z no cast

equality comparison of a type overload these would correspond to if such an interface do this for each t you want to compare bool operator t bool operator t comparison code should be done in one the interface method comparing to another type implement as and put the field comparison code for that type in overloaded methods and operators should forward the equality comparison task to the main instance such that an clean dependency hierarchy is maintained and stricter guarantees are introduced at each level to eliminate redundancy and unessential if is this for each you may return to return is null or cannot be compared to this therefore it is not if to object for reference equality or use return performance only if object instance is frequently compared to otherwise just an extra useless return type fields to determine static bool operator t t y if to object for reference equality or use return y to equals on instance if return was y is not return static bool operator t t y if return y to equals on instance if return was y is not return preceding implementation centralizes the field comparison to the end of the implementation for the and operators have a parallel but opposite i prefer this over having one reference the such that there is an extra method call for the dependent if the operator is simply going to call the rather than offer an equally performing then you may as well just use and avoid the extra method is left out from the equals operator and the because it can introduce unnecessary overhead in some inconsistent performance depending on how often an instance is compared to itself vs other alternative i but should is to reverse this centralizing the equality code in the equality operator instead and have the equals methods depend on one could then use the shortcut of to check for reference equality and null equality simultaneously as philip mentioned in an earlier but that idea is it seems like killing two birds with one but your actually creating more work after determining the objects are neither both null nor the same you will in still have to on to check whether each instance is in my you check for any single instance being null exactly by the time the equals instance method is already ruled out that the first object being compared is so all left to do is check whether the other is so after at most two we jump directly into the field no matter which method we use as i if you really are comparing and object to itself the majority of the then you could add that check in the equals method just before diving into the field the point in adding it last is that you can still maintain the hierarchy without introducing a check at every

error means that there is a symbol that has been defined in one place and an alternate definition has been made in another can occur if in cases you define two functions with the same there is a mismatch between a function and call a function before it has been and without a this last case there will be a mismatch between the real function and the that the compiler assumes when it have a prototype to situations can be avoided that function prototypes are only declared that all functions have unique names within their scope within a file if they are or unique if they are used between object careful if using statements in source files to declare better to use a prototype from the appropriate header that all functions have prototypes either within the source file in the case of or in a header file if they are to be used by other object that all header files can only be included once for each source by using either of the constructs suggested by mehrdad and brian

expanded on the answer to answer some of the compiler takes the inner classes and turns them into since private methods are only available to the inner class the compiler has to add new methods that have package level access so that the classes have access to like this ones are added by the a private void final b b new call changed by the method generated by the compiler visible by classes in the same void private void final a a new call changed by the method generated by the compiler visible by classes in the same void classes are the but they have the addition of a reference to the outer class so that the methods can be called on reason java does it this way is that they did not want to require vm changes to support inner so all of the changes had to be at the compiler compiler takes the inner class and turns it into a top level class at the vm level there is no such thing as an inner the compiler then also has to generate the new they are made at the package level to ensure that only classes in the same package can access the compiler also updated the method calls to the private methods to the generated can avoid having the compiler generate the method my declaring the methods as absence of and the downside to that is that any class in the package can call the

from the world of and learning been wondering about get and set functions in in usage of these are quite and tools like visual studio promote usage by making them very easy and quick to this seem to be the case in the the class private string public string get return set bar in class foo people will well whats the point in why not just create a public field and then make it a property later if you need actually not i just do it out of good practice because seen it done so many because so used to doing i feel like i should carry over the habit to my but is this really i see it done as often as with the from what i thanks for the tip void return i always wonder if using is good to me that seems like a whole lot of leg considering using visual tools the implementation would take literally seconds to and the took me a lot longer to type i feel its not worth the especially when the alternative is 5 lines what i these are the can change implementation details for the get and set so instead of returning a private field you can return something more can remove a later on and make it only for a public facing this not the ages to is this worth the generally in some the advantages make it worth the but i speaking in terms of is did i choose answer with less i was actually very close to choosing however my personal opinion is apparently is that the answer over egged the answer i on the other seems to argue both i think getters and setters evil if used excessively that i when not necessary and would break the business but why we have a function called this would be far more versatile than what if i wanted to show it to the user in another way than as the class wanted me in some sense may not be relevant enough to argue that and setters are because it have an accompanying and speaking of a function called could be bad my because it would imply to the implementer of the function that the account must be manipulated out side of the which is not a good get and set functions popular with

got a fairly simple windows service running on testbed ec2 nodes right now that a web service on a machine in our local data center when the service starts service is set to automatic so it runs when the instance comes another web service once a minute as a monitoring a third web service when the service using this in our linux ec2 instances perfectly and the windows service works fine on and manual problem is that when terminating the node via the service never seems to be or at it never makes the web service any that this is copied verbatim from my post on the aws developer but that is traffic compared to regarding the point about the network going also not the most in windows if i set netman as a service would the order of service termination be guaranteed to respect the model adopted for a similar system running on plain linux instances treats app servers as so ebs benefit us that we use rightscale on top of which makes hooking into linux instances shutting so we just ship off the logs i got a reply from the aws staff much faster than i terminating through api means through elasticfox is a hard shutdown due to some technical it means it is like turning off your machine with power button instead of services and shutting down ec2

got subversion with tortoisesvn and setup here for our first mvc so far been working out pretty well so i would recommend to mention they are both free which is of significance depending on your i tried any vs integration because we have some stuff that we use vs for so i just keep it relegated to the file we even really fully configured cruise control but my favorite part is that once i know something is working i can commit it and once i get the notification email that it built successfully i instantly know improved the since switched over to using it has more of a graphical interface and allows you to skip the whole xml file configuration a couple of things to note is based on java but in my experience all that difficult to set up if you take your time and follow the it still works fine for will need to add a hook to svn the equivalent for your source control to have it wget the build you can have it poll svn automatically every few it varies between projects for i have a few set up each use robocopy to move the files by running a batch script after the when files are copied over robocopy produces a different exit code than when it copies no which causes hudson to think there was an i worked around this by simply duplicating each robocopy command i

guess the advantage of having your xml reside there in your project solution is that you can maintain it in vs with nice formatting and even but then using something like xml spy or whatever can give you that refer to it in a class need to ensure you have access to and that it resides in a reliable the past used post build events to move the latest copy of the file to where i need as arnshea writes here is another the output you can use the to output property on the xml file itself to achieve then your classes can use the xml knowing it will reside in a reliable need to make sure accessible though especially if writing back to make sure it end up as source control system could do to storing these files in a folder under program files could also be problematic especially on where user privileges are	
guessing you have control over the other two if you this be too could just have them listen to a socket and see if the socket is available when you come next solution may actually be language you could manage the whole system through batch file write a batch file that creates a file when it starts up and deletes it when it unix systems use this technique a call the file a lock file more often than only your app will ever start these other then you could simply track if started it or so guessing this possible or you be so assuming that the user may have launched these programs through some other you have no control over the launching of the other apps and even write a batch file to launch then you just do what you want to do the apps would have to always use the batch even if the user started them by just a ditch effort might be to get a process status and parse but have to know exactly what the other apps were called in the this really all java apps tend to have the same exact signature in most process status printouts which could make this problem is that if one of these programs were started outside your you have virtually no way to identify that fact unless you happen to know exact process status and even then

have not used but the answer probably depends on your best bet might be to establish metrics of guess at the number of threads and then run a binary search as was guessing rather simple game begins something like thinking of an integer between forty and sixty and to your guesses respond or as might be the supposing that n is the number of possible values as was then at most questions are required to determine the since each question halves the search note that one less question is required than for the general since the number is already constrained to be within a particular if the number guessing can be arbitrarily in which case there is no upper bound we can still find the number in at most steps k is the selected by first finding an upper bound by repeated for if the number were we could use the following sequence of guesses to find could also extend the technique to include negative for example the following guesses could be used to find

i have found myself doing often lately is declaring typedefs relevant to a particular class inside that typedef typedef types are then used elsewhere in the new lorem i like reduces the noise introduced by the class becomes serves as a statement of intent in the example the lorem class is intended to be reference counted via and stored in a allows the implementation to change if lorem needed to be changed to be intrusively reference counted at a later stage then this would have minimal impact to the think it looks and is arguably easier to i like are sometimes issues with dependencies if you want to a within another class but only need to forward declare lorem opposed to introducing a dependency on its header then you end up having to use the explicit types rather than which is a little may not be very and hence harder to try to be objective with my coding so it would be good to get some other opinions on it so i can dissect my thinking a little typedefs in good style or bad

i misread the and thought that it was a duplicate of but the 100mbps makes it completely very modest hardware should be able to saturate a 100mbps connection with no problems particularly if using 1440 byte udp suggested by the figures do look suspiciously like a 10mbps rather than i would check all of the links from end to end to make sure that they are at the 100mbps that you believe them to any 10mbps link in that chain is going to be a on the equipment that using you may find that there have been issues with link some equipment is notoriously so you may find better results by turning autonegotiation and forcing the link speeds to as you have a pcap file that i would suggest trying to do some speed there are several options that tcpreplay provides to replay files at the highest possible look at wiki that gives you different results than seeing at the moment it could point to a problem with the pcap for the pcap files do contain timing information that can be used when replaying the if the timing in your pcap file was taken from a 10mbps network then replaying it in real time will give you the result that

i understand you you have 3 tables structured as int not int not not in int not int not not in int not int not null in or you are trying to do is define such that you could cascade updates and deletes between the because of how and are you will guarantee that there is no overlap between the problem is figuring out which table has the reference to you can do with this definition is cascade from or to since the relationship is quite clear in that to cascade from up is more since you know which table to cascade either define two fields in one to reference each of the other and then you can define the relationship between all three knowing that for any given record there will only be one or two tables never all you can use code to figure out which table to relate this particular row to and cascade

if i am asking same question again but want to have two processes p1 and is a writer is a reader is some shared memory or a file that p1 writes to and as soon as p1 p2 should be notified for as per my understanding pseudocode for p1 should shared a named to signal write for p2 some processing on to named on in handle to shared handle to named on named from on it required to have locks in the the reader will just read the file and not change so i guess no locks are required in the can it go wrong in some case without am opening and closing handles to the file every time during reading and i think that is not i can open the file handle in the constructor and close it in the destructor of reader and but can i read from the file when it is being used in everytime writer is writing 10 bytes at the end of file and reader is supposed to read the latest 10 bytes written by writer

in addition to my previous answer i suggest reading about the the pdf would recommend mvp pattern instead of you really need any special frameworks for just how you organize your approach i usually is to split each windows form into three class this is what you actually start with when developing a this is where of your logic should view interface which contains the properties and this interface is that the presenter knows about your the when you finish implementing the presenter and the view unit you can then create the actual form class and make it implement the iview then just a question of adding appropriate controls to the form and wiring them to the code simple just for string username string password event eventhandler void void public new private void we ask some service to verify the bool islogonok if private iview form public presenter new public string get return set public string get return set public void username or public void code for opening another private presenter

in only works for the immediate you access a looks someone else beat me to the punch with the answer about it being possible to do in i think the way i did the code gen has some so post it thing i did differently is to use expression which enable you to use the compiler to do overload resolution and generic argument stuff is and you want to have to replicate it your self if you can help your the code would work like del would probably want to store the delegate in a readonly static so that you only have to compile it need to specify 3 generic owner type this is the class that you would have invoked the code from if you were not using base class this is the class you want to make the non virtual call delegate this should represent the signature of the method being called with an extra parameter for the possible to eliminate but it requires more work in the code gen method takes a single a lambda representing the it has to be a and only a if you want to extend the code gen you can support more complex the lambda body is restricted to only being able to access lambda and can only pass them in directly to the you can remove this restriction if you extend the code gen in the method body to support all expression that would take some work you can do anything you want with the delegate that comes so the restriction too big of a important to note that this code is not it could use a lot more and it work with or parameters because of expression tree did test it in sample cases with void methods returning and generic and it you can find some edge cases that any the il gen static tdelegate where tdelegate if throw new must be a delegate var body as if body throw new a call foreach arg in if support non lambda parameter you need to add support for compiling all expression throw new a constant or parameter if null support a non constant you have to implement support for compiling all expression throw new a constant base var parammap new int index foreach item in parametertypes var m new var builder var calltarget if var paramindex foreach item in var param if var obj return obj as	
in response to it is crucial that the database be optimized in addition to the hibernate when you think about after all the work hibernate in the end it is just querying the if the database perform well or missing poorly set up table it matter how much you tune on the flip side if your database is set up well but hibernate the caching is not set up and you are going back to the database a lot more then you need then performance will suffer as it is always important to tune the system end to but start at the foundation and work curious what you mean about do you mean columns have been added to tables that represented in the hibernate data tables have been i think anything like that would affect performance likely data integrity if you are not all the goal of the object model should not be match the database schema you want to abstract the underlying data complexity joins that is the whole point of using something like for example lets say you have things very and application code should be able to do something having to know that underneath it is a one to many the details in your hibernate code control how the load is done that answer your question then please provide more

inclination is usually to store data in the most flexible form for numbers should be stored using integer or not because you can do math with numeric types but not with strings easy enough to parse a number into a string that this is not a big perhaps a more practical should be stored using the actual data type instead of maybe easier to convert html into plain text than vice in which case want to store your text as or maybe even using a format like markdown which can be easily converted into either html or plain the same reason vector graphics formats an svg file is essentially a sequence of instructions specifying how to draw the easy to convert that into a bitmap image of any whereas if you only had a bitmap image to start have a hard time changing its size to create a without losing

instinct is it would be pretty tough for a programming language library to provide api access to the source to mysqldump is written in with its own designed to operate pretty much as its own it gets built as an and much of the error reporting and output are handled using direct print statements to and not using return values that could be wrapped into a most bindings for a specific programming language are compiled they link against and libmysql contains no reference to the mysqldump i say for sure that no one has written a but it would be a very bizarre wrapper other your best bet is to use a from your programming language of choice to call the mysqldump and absorb the results either from stdin or from a temp

is a stricter relationship than composition means that something is so strongly related to something else that they cannot basically exist or if they they live in different world you define a gui and then a text field where to write the class defining the gui and the class defining the text field they compose a widget which can be seen as an entity on its suppose you delete the and you delete the text field as is in the sense that the link between the two entities is and a real world suppose you have a database of objects containing multiple data now you run some filter to collect the data instances obeying a given and the resulting instances are pushed into a graphical list so that the user can see when the graphical widget receives the it can form an aggregation of these and present if the user closes the window with the graphical and the latter get the data objects should not be maybe they are displayed somewhere or you still need in composition is defined at creation aggregation is instead defined later in the object

is code which includes a variadic function and calls to the variadic i would expect that it would output each sequence of numbers it does when compiled as a but not when compiled as a void argument for i val return is the output when compiled for argument argument argument argument argument note that the reason the variadic function pulls out is because the use of this is for a variadic function that accepts a list of pointers and naturally the length argument should be a and in some cases a caller might pass in a length for for i const ptr const len that the passed into might encounter the problem described and really the caller should be using or the result of or just plain put the number into a but the point is that the compiler is not catching this common danger with variadic right thing to do here is to eliminate the variadic function and replace it with a better mechanism that provides type i would like to document this and collect more detailed information as to exactly why this problem exists on this platform and manifests as it does this variadic function fail on 4th parameter on windows

is how i do using for form in endfor a javascript var newelement var total type var name total var id var newfor total type it accepts as the first and the of formset as the 2nd what the should do is pass it what it should in this i pass it so that jquery looks for the last table with a class of the part of it is important because the is also used to determine what the new form will be inserted more than likely want it at the end of the rest of the the argument is so that we can update the notably as well as the actual form if you have a formset full the management fields will have ids of and while the form fields will be in a format of with being the form starting with so with the argument the function looks at how many forms there currently and goes through every input and label inside the new form replacing all the field from something like to and so after it is it updates the field to reflect the new form and adds it to the end of the function is particularly helpful to me because the way it is setup it allows me to use it throughout the app when i want to provide more forms in a and make me need to have a hidden form to duplicate as long as i pass it the formset name and the format in which the forms are laid hope it

is nothing new or the just talking about native been able to do plugins for the only special thing about is that it allows native code and to talk to each other in a plugin and the little trick where dll can be seen as a singleton object that implements the interface you can use the supports function from the unit to check if the dll and all the methods are you want to do what the talking about in delphi for look at the getprocaddress and freelibrary windows api if you absolutely must have an interface like the article you have to write it either in the dll you wrote the dll by writing an exported function that returns an or in the calling by writing a function that uses getprocaddress to create an interface this requires mucking around with and is usually more trouble than best bet is probably just to do what tim sullivan use tjvpluginmanager from the if you only need native or if you have to talk to

is right that immutability would fix but that would also be you could just lock the whole thing but that could be a performance i can think of two good is to use a requires or since your checkpoint can acquire the read lock it can be assured things are but when no one is reading performance should be pretty this is still a pretty coarse so you may also want to do is to break things each area of the program could keep own map map for gui the map for user the map for hardware each one would have a lock on it and things would go about as when it came time to the checkpointer would grab all the locks things are and then do the catch here is you have define an order for the locks to be grabbed in otherwise with the maps are orthogonal to each other to one require updates to another to be then the easiest thing may be to push the updates to a central map in the not unlike something you biggest question to you would how much of a problem is this are updates very or are they that would help to advise on something since my last idea could be but easy and may not is a fantastic book called concurrency in which is basically the java threading it discusses how to figure out this kind of stuff and strategies to avoid problems or make solving them if you are going to be doing more a very useful if your key values are orthogonal to then things are really the interface are implemetations such as the would solve your problems since they can do changes so readers see inconsistent but if you have any two keys that must be updated at the same time this cover hope this threading access to shared data structures is complex

is slicehost using to serve options are things or called passenger phusion or like are dedicated servers plugins to which run an instance of your rails your host using then probably defaulting to rails comes with a simple cgi script that will serve the but it reloads the app for every i suspect that this is the most likely that your app is running off of the cgi in which would explain the this tends to be a default deployment on many since it require extra configuration on their but it give good your host supports rails supports that fast cgi will open a cgi and keep it open for multiple so you get much better but not nearly as good as mongrel or is it in or the easy way to tell is to go to a page in your app that gives an if it shows you a stack in development which is slower than production mongrel and have startup options to determine whether to run the app in production or development if your database is slow for whatever that will be a big bottleneck as if you do have a good deployment in production try looking into

management systems are specifically designed to store data and retrieve it to preserve the integrity of the data and to leverage concurrent access to the on the other was originally designed for separating the content from the it became a handy way to store simple data because the file structure is so well and then it went out of hand with people trying to store entire databases in an unsuited guarantee fast access or anything like not dataset libraries do help in that but just because you can serialize dataset objects to xml make it a good place to store data for multiple faced with two one which was designed to do exactly what you need to do this case a and one that was designed to do something else but has been kludged to do what you sorta this case you should probably go with the first	
many features do you really in many cases i find converting to one type internally and handling the various encodings only when loading or saving is more than if you are willing to spend a little time and write a class to handle that sure you will reuse it again and have one lying around but iirc the is your project really does need to handle various encodings other than to files then you are probably best off with a library

need to design an application that resembles an internal mailing this is just a course no networking the professor is just making us put the discussed data structures to i have been having trouble deciding how to design the let me explain briefly what i have to do and then i will share my think it would be a good idea if let you know that this is a command line based no gui internal mail system consists of 5 different possible and it is possible to be only at one state at a when the application it enters the general state by the only possible command in this state is to log in to some other account the user has basic commands like reading his sending new ones to some other deleting logging and a couple a user can change to one of two compose or to get to the compose the user must use the command in this state you compose a message to some other once you finish composing the message you go back to the user the only way a user could go back to general is by logging inherits the behavior of and mod are pretty much the they can change states as a summary of how it is possible to change a new to design been reading a lot about them this will be the first time implement if one of my suggestions seem weird please let me state pattern seems like a great i lets me change an object state not all states have the same administrators has more methods than moderator does not have any of the methods from admin or you can only use general to log i think that this will then limit the ability to use state do you have any suggestions for some other idea i had was something like the since i can ascend and descend i could be seen as a for a user that is in compose compose top user general you have any ideas on how i could implement is it even although comfortable with java the or pseudo code is a design

need to poll a web service in some time intervals and just return whatever seems appropriate to your application the messages you and update the progress the process is first step is to actually initiate the operation that must run and second step is to constantly poll the server to see if the operation is you would have to somehow store the current operation status on the i know which technology working so i can only tell you to use something that your framework of choice but make sure the process state is set in a variable that can be persisted is in example in a session synchronizing this value between the running process and the polling method may be such splash screens are rather used in desktop applications or in web applications when the processing is performed on the i think a good idea to try to have an updating progress when the method running asynchronously resides on the a progress indicator like this would be good when loading assets images or other and you can count the currently loaded the total size and so no matter whether the processing operation will be invoked on the server or on the client it must be you want yet another dull indicator in your web you may randomly display some funny quotes or other texts from an solution minimize the time it takes to process the

nice thing about wordpress is that you can go a few different routes trying to accomplish route worked well for me is to list each business as a post and then create categories and to house these once this is you can create custom templates for either category templates if your have a category named and it has the category id of you can create a template named and then wordpress will know to look to that template first and then move on to the regular file and so your category template you can then list out each sub category a function like and call out the children categories from other option is to still go the route of entering in your businesses as a separate filing them under the appropriate but instead of creating a category you can create a page need to do a few things for your template file the necessary template syntax to tell wordpress to look for that as a template file such food a page in wordpress using this new your page template create a new pointing to this such new if while and do other stuff here are other options you can do as and for i would hang out some wordpress user groups to see if you can grab some other

of a base class to a derived class makes sense if you consider assignment or conversion to be a value by value confusing about is the inconsistent way it does is a i this creates an j this creates another int and copies the value of i into is not a simple this does not create a copy of only a reference to b new this actually creates an this sets the reference to an object a to the reference to an object both of them reference the same no values were it were doing a copy of values then copying to base class to a derived class work like other think that might be confusing

of the physical write to disk is the bottle neck by some orders of and it is in most scenarios rather parallelizing writes you have good chances to performance by incurring sequential reads and writes will largely outperform interleaving n most parallelization and mainly work by reducing the seeks that are naturally required when different clients concurrently request data from different sections of the if you can avoid these seeks in the first you are better some scenarios raid jbod or when different streams of data arrive rather slowly the right scheduling can improve your but that requires intimate knowledge of the hardware at and other processes not spoiling your you can leave that as a decision to the end user give an option to turn it and provide performance measures to guide might even prove me wrong

of which engine you there are some key concepts to you are dealing with so many the main one is that of level of detail make sure your objects have realistic lod associated with for you bother to render the model of the screw when viewing the whole when closer to it yet still far enough a version of the screw is good enough for you can do tricks like virtual earth and tile your data is related to culling is going to be very but probably dealt with any of those engines you have already you are dealing with gis check out still in early but backed by a lot of good and designed to handle large quantities of they even have ways to embed video as a you are dealing in as you i really would take a look at it is a 3d gis not a game it is which means you have to worry about rendering as you might have to with other have all the constructs you need fast which entity you classes with easy controls for conditional is integrated into the engine as part of the this means that you can even define what things looked like at a previous point in time and go back and forth on the difference between a 3d engine and a game engine can get pretty from what the key difference is that game engines are more worried about making things look good than for we used the unreal engine to render our but we had to make everything to different scales than it looked but not to this might make a difference when dealing with details down to screws as you are little i do not work for but i have personally met the engineers that are creating this they are integrating the latest gpu and rendering so it is by far one of the best engines it leverages knowledge and technology used by their main application which is used by many people for astronomical

one so i is not really a property of a file format files are binary after but rather of a file format and viewer app called human readable formats are all based on top of additional abstraction layer of one of existing text and viewer programs also serving as an that are capable of rendering these encodings in a form readable by humans are very encoding standards are widespread and fairly which means unlikely to evolve much in the foreseeable on top of the text encoding layer of the format we find a syntax layer that is reasonably intuitive given target user knowledge and cultural the benefits of of suitable viewers and that cultural conventions change read and on the extra abstraction layer makes text encoded to files do not resort to text encoding abstraction layer as a base a common but they might or might not use some sort of an extra abstraction more suitable for their purpose and they can be much better optimised for a specific task at hand the other and editors are specific for a particular binary format and make interoperability for any given format are less wide because they are more might evolve significantly or go out of use over their main benefit in being very well suited for a particular task and as the task or task requirements so does the	
one thing is bugging me about the idea of a as mentioned is that you still have a valid variable containing an but the type is being this seems allowable since we can still work with the address data the type is somewhat superfluous less in this dereferencing it is because to try and a make sense we know what class to refer and thus the memory to jump the vtable pointers to then seem to make sense that on its own would be ok since only refer to the but none of its no class information is needed to do just the i understand absolutely no use for but important in defining when things break allowing this a reference dereferenced but not accessing ref also makes and thus would allow void not saying anyone should take it up with those in but from a point of seem luc touraille pointed out above this is my it could be but the issue is a semantic the reasonable explanation i could come to was that since an object variable is a for a sequence of the type is of important semantic the being thought of as a variable with an address treats the type as somewhat superfluous not key to defining anyone agree with

problem i see with the method is the location where drawing the my understanding is that each sprite in your game is a separate the graphics object being passed in the paintcomponent method different for each you can imagine a graphics object as a painting if you only had 1 graphics object for the entire and this graphics object represented the entire game then your logic would be correct and everything should each sprite here has its own graphics presumably with height and width relevant to the in this your paintcomponent method would probably just look void if always at because with your moving the and graphics around the game the coordinates you pass to are relative to the graphics you always want to start painting in the hand of the getting just a gray square because trying to draw the image way out of bounds of the graphics the long i think this approach is going to work because not that easy to move jpanels around inside of their parent containers using absolute not really scalable either because jpanels are pretty heavyweight and take a lot of resources to create and are probably better of having a single jpanel that represents the entire game each sprite be a subclass of so you have a paintcomponent you could do something like class gamearea extends private final sprites to public void sprite class sprite no need to extend your other code looks ok public void

program is syntactically valid but it will produce undefined behaviour because you pass the address of a stack object to the heap typically this means that your program will crash when stack and the heap are two distinct areas of memory allocated to the process executing your the stack grows as you enter a function to hold its arguments and local and it shrinks automatically as you return from the the on the other is a separate address region where memory may be obtained on and must be released explicitly when it is no longer the address of a local variable is passed to it may attempt to free its memory and allocate it since the address is not from the and operates on the this will most likely will detect the address is not from the heap and abort the from the example program contains a few logical mystring declare a variable to hold a not a a string has type a pointer to the char is assigned the address zero which is conventionally assigned to invalid this compiles because the preprocessor replaces by the literal you store a zero byte in the which also by the terminator of a mentioned this is illegal because you pass the address of a stack object to the heap this problem remains in your second code you discard the return returns the address where the new memory was it may not be the same address as it may even be which is way of telling you it went out of is but the cast is is a more correct version of your allocate space one character terminator mystring some code using mystring omitted get more space mystring write to the string free the memory return it is better to avoid for you could use something like the some code using mystring mystring return

question is more of an architectural less involved with the actual have build an api based on but really decide on how to separate the pl from the i have made my service so that it holds only a minimum of something tagitemresponse return of course the first question in what layer do the requestprocessors i think it would be wrong to call them a but at the same they have nothing to do with as for i decided that they nevertheless belong in the the processor methods take my as validate the request message authenticate and eventually return a single dto like override void tagitemresponse host var profile var item var tags new foreach name in var tag i ask why do i need the facade classes related to my business for example i have a hostfacade that acts as a layer between the hostdao and the holds very little it merely handles the dao static host return i might as well merge the processors and the read many on the but i still settle on the way to go and tend to chose a different approach every time i face the i wonder if a right approach even found the dofactory where they talked to the dao classes right from within the service i really like as most servicecontract methods share some and thus lend themselves well for use with shared base also found other examples where only the facades are called from within the but that seems to work well only for very my messages are and composite in order to reduce the number of calls to the service as much as my extra processing layer seems the be my real there is no single answer as to how to correctly layer a wcf but hopefully there are some of you out there with an opinion that will either conform my instincts or shed some new light on the subject for a wcf service the right way

quick reference on the principle control working is an is an client has a very ackward modify the appointment label on the devexpress schedulercontrol so that the user can click or double click on a name and go to their profile instead of the appointment edit the subject field text is currently set up to hold the name and phone problem is that appointmentlabels equipped for there is no container attached to the appointment label to insert any kind of button or anything like something like this would be no problem in using the item tried negotiating for some things i thought would achieve the same effect while leveraging extensibility the schedulercontrol such as putting the profile link in the edit form many button or a custom editor or prepared menu confusing for this is the only ui design the client will is it even possible to put a hyperlink control inside the appointment label of a a hyperlink or button in the appointment label of a	
quite simply going totally bonkers with the omission of the for the label and textbox controls in compact i have a simple supposed to list a bunch of text data between to a few paragraphs of in a everything else works but my attempts at dynamically resizing the label textbox i use to display the text are failing the way tried doing the text intended for the textbox intended amount of pixels per line to adjust whitespace due to linesarray lines lineheight str in if szz lines lines 0 1 lines the problem is that the range needed for whitespaceadjustment is too when large enough to actually work on the most extreme cases made mostly up of really long most boxes end up being a line or two too probably going to have to implement word wrapping but before i go is there anybody with a nice clean solution ready for be forever for label textbox in compact

real question is why you need this to not be if it should not be cached because it changes all the the server should specify to not cache the if it just changes sometimes one of the resources it depends on can and if the client code has a way of knowing about it can append a dummy parameter to the url that is computed from some hash or last modified date of those resources what we do in microsoft ajax script resources so they can be cached forever but new versions can still be served as they if the client know of the correct way should be for the server to handle head requests properly and tell the client whether to use the cached version or to me like appending a random parameter or telling from the client to never cache is wrong because cacheability is a property of the server and so should be decided question to ask oneself is should this resource really be served through get or should it go through that is a question of but it also has security implications are attacks that work only if the server allows for post will not get	
real question seems to be do i get my main div to and my footer to go to the bottom of the the answer is going to you do it with tables at least not if you use a doctype that specifies html transitional or it works without a but because browsers enter their in that believe you can do it with absolute and probably seen look more at an approach that uses fixed positioning for the with a larger so that it renders on top of the and then use a gradient effect to make the main content disappear behind an example by someone far better than

recommendation is to keep the database schema definition under source using the scm repository and as the rest of the code in the that way easier to keep the database in sync with the application that uses it would be embarrassing for the application to query a table that development typically is going on in different branches of source control version version and version early you need database instance per this allows you to modify the database design for version and as without interfering with the stability of maintenance work on version definitely need a separate database instance for versus i worked on an app that sent notification emails to i want users to be confused by spurious emails sent by my test in my test i changed all the email addresses to mock addresses at my own so i could verify they were being sent as many times as i needed without bothering i do that if i were using the same database for test and on your team should have their own including all components of the system as the that way each developer can work able to make changes and invoke debuggers and without interfering with the work of anyone else on the the other this may not be setting up a complete duplicate system for each developer may be too compare the cost of this setup work to the potential for gains in since developers have to coordinate testing with each other as

secure hash algorithm algorithm takes a message of less than 264 bits in length and produces a message the algorithm is slightly slower than but the larger message digest makes it more secure against collision and inversion the algorithm specified in the secure hash standard fips was developed by is a revision to sha that was published in the revision corrected an unpublished flaw in its design is very similar to the md4 family of hash functions developed by is also described in the ansi is an algorithm for it is the first algorithm known to be suitable for signing as well as and one of the first great advances in public key rsa is widely used in electronic commerce and is believed to be secure given sufficiently long keys and the use of most notable difference is that sha is an encryption algorithm whereas rsa is both an encryption as well as signing it was announced that it is possible to find a collision in in this research result is due to professor xiaoyun wang of tsinghua university in together with professors andrew yao and frances it extends the work of and which demonstrated that a collision could be found in what that means is that it is easier for a collision to occur in sha than in rsa but no two similar keys have ever been found that

so having a similarly hard time reading the entirety of that but see if i can piece it together from what i did figure start gitk simplifies things by condensing a string of commits into an containing a series of commits that each only have one parent and one aside from anything doing this should cut down pretty dramatically on the number of nodes you have to consider for your which will help out any algorithm you as a related commits will end up grouped does introduce some complexity in terms of finding an arc when you read a new there are a few new commit has a single or no it extends a most of the just extend the most recent there are a few interesting may cause an existing arc to be if its parent already has a child its parent turns out to be a branch which i gather you know ahead of could be a that connects two arcs may already know that this commit has multiple new commit has multiple parents merge may want to include the or commits in or it may make more sense to keep them either it be too difficult to build up this set of arcs you have these still left with trying to linearize in your the first algorithm described on the aforementioned sounds as you have a known set of branch points to use as your initial set commits should be first of you only have to care when you connect two either through a new merge a branch or combining two arcs into any given arc can easily maintain its current row number range fine with putting an arc on sequential so traversing up the tree checking that all new ancestors show up later should be pretty know enough to say much about drawing the graph but i imagine it be too different from what you do i hope that it was interesting to think at	
so i have to build a web app in id much much much prefer because its more modern and makes more sense to i know mvc and have come from a rails so this webforms stuff looks kinda gross to me i need an tree one that loads the subtrees via ajax when nodes are asp mvc i would do something like making a partial representing a single and a jquery ajax triggered controller action that renders a collection of these which is inserted into the children in my options a webforms control that represents a single use asp ajax to call a codebehind method that recursivley adds controls representing the children of this fits well within the offical asp pretty webforms are and makes upgrading this site to later much a webservices method that returns the children as a json which are then formatted to html in using jquery for the requesting and speedy due to low overheads with more as easily transition to mvc controller more work to html ends up mixed up in with the clientside theres no templating which is a third party web least best have to evalutate which one to may have to with control other what do you guys think is the best way to ajax

stop custom formatter might only be slightly more efficient than the but you can add more features to your own implementation that would make it more did a similar thing in and here are some of the features i added just format the method accepts either a varargs array or a map be a so my format strings can look like f quick brown jumped over the if i already have my objects in a map is pretty i can call the format method like s i have a special syntax for performing regular expression replacements on strings during the formatting after calling all space characters in the object string are converted to f blah blah blah blah i have a special syntax that allows the formatted to check the argument for applying a different formatter depending on whether the object is null or f blah blah blah blah are a zillion other things you can one of the tasks on my todo list is to add a new syntax where you can automatically format and other collections by specifying a formatter to apply to each element as well as a string to insert between all something like wraps each elements in adjacent elements with a f blah blah blah blah the syntax is a little awkward and not in love with it the point is that your existing class might not be much more efficient than the framework but if you extend it to satisfy all of your personal you might end up with a very convenient library in the i use my own version of this library for dynamically constructing all sql error and localization enormously

take this as a criticism of your the choice to require javascript is certainly yours to make though as others have mentioned you may need to be concerned about accessibility you might find it to develop a web site that is friendly using mvc rather than new ajaxhelper extensions make it almost trivial to include code that relies on ajax for most but work in the absence of javascript in the obviously the experience is degraded for people who have it more if you use jquery plugins for etc but it is still the framework provides a pretty easy mechanism on the server side to determine whether the request is an ajax request or not so you can respond appropriately by rendering a new view or sending back as know that found it much easier to write accessible web sites using mvc than i did with

the challenge here is because your application is meant to do a kind of task in a smart the very goal you hope to achieve is that the application becomes better than human beings at finding these and cool but if you pull it then it becomes very hard for any human beings to this the answer should be ideally the computer would i see why you think but consider these terabytes of information over have you read them based on i would argue that the answer should be if you really succeeded in your original the end user might sometimes that is a better you found a pattern that is going to make us save us or such a thing could never then why are you asking the computer to detect these kinds of patterns in the first the best thing i can think of is to let real life help you build up a list of test if there ever was a pattern discovered in the past that did turn out to be then make a that sees if your system discovers it when given similar i say in quotes because it may be more like an integration but you may still choose to use nunit or or rspec or whatever unit test tools some of these you might somehow try to the terabytes of data really mock the but at some higher level mock some of the conclusions reached from that for maybe you have a with some data in from which you expect a set of patterns to be if you can do it would be great if the system could its behind the patterns it this would let the business user deliberate over the question of whether the application was right or

the data in the text file looks like this separated by x2 x3 can read the strings into a cell array using like now stores the strings in a cell to make a variable out of one of these strings and assign it a i would use 1 will create a variable in the base workspace and assign it the value 1 the first argument can be either or to create a variable in either the matlab base workspace or the workspace of the caller you would repeat this for each string name in giving it whatever value you is an alternate answer to the one i gave you the above answer addresses the specific problem you raised in your answer gives you a whole other option to potentially avoid doing things the way you were describing them in your and it will hopefully make things easier for i understand your you basically have 256 and you want to randomly pick 30 of each of these matrices sounds like it is stored in its own variable to i would suggest storing all 256 matrices in just one variable as either a initialize all matrices as 0 2 this enters a value for the first a cell initializes an empty array of 2 enters a value for the first would have to initialize all the values then if you want to randomly pick 30 you can next randomize the order of either the third dimension of the array or the order of the cell array by using the default order of the randomly order the numbers 1 to for a for a cell just use the first 30 entries in for your calculations of the individual variables like you were puts the first matrix from the array in puts the first matrix from the cell array in can keep repeating the use of randperm to keep generating new randomized arrays of if you have to keep track of which original matrices you are you have to add this line after you randomize the entries of will tell you the original position a matrix was for if the first array entry in is then the matrix in the first position of was originally the 40th matrix you entered when you initialized this

there any a timeout executes a certain amount of time after is an interval executes a certain amount of time after the previous interval will notice the difference if your function takes a while to for if we represent a call to with a firing of the with and javascript code execution with the timelines look next complication is if an interval fires whilst javascript is already busy doing something as handling a previous in this the interval is and happens as soon as the previous handler finishes and returns control to the so for example for a process that is sometimes short and sometimes long represents an interval firing that execute its code straight and was made pending intervals try to to get back on they queue one on top of each there can only ever be one execution pending per they all queued the browser would be left with an list of outstanding x represents an interval firing that execute or be made so instead was your function habitually takes longer to execute than the interval that is set for the browser will eat cpu trying to service and may become less do you use and gives a guaranteed slot of free time to the interval tries to ensure the function it is running executes as close as possible to its scheduled at the expense of browser ui would consider an interval for animations i wanted to be as smooth as whilst chained timeouts are more polite for ongoing animations that would take place all the time whilst the page is for less demanding uses as a trivial updater firing every 30 seconds or you can safely use terms of browser settimeout predates but all browsers you will meet today support the last straggler for many years was ie mobile in winmo but hopefully that too is now behind

there any way in which you can test whether an instance of a generic parameter in a generic method has been assigned to when it can be either a value or reference i would like to be able to do this in a generic method i have to persist where t is the instance and k is the type of the identifier field for that type all objects i am persisting have because they inherit from a base i do not want to limit k to being a value the code is something like static bool variable to hold object k instanceid properties loop through properties of the if property is decorated with a specific attribute then assign to end check that we have a value assigned to instanceid other than if not return false otherwise continue to persist k can be a value type checking if it is equal to results in an error as it relies on it being is there a way around that i have got around the need for this in the current case by placing a condition on the generic type t that it must inherit from the base type baseobject so my question is about the general issue around generics and testing assignment for a generic

there but it is not easy and may not be worth your way of doing it is to create your own buildprovider and replace the default with it in the config would also create your own most likely inherited from the the buildprovider is responsible for supplying the in most primitive situation you could overwrite the parsefile read the aspx process create a copy and pass it to the base all aspx parsing code is sealed and internal to ms so you rewriting it would mean building entire compilation alternative method is to create your own page builder and put it in the the drawback is that you get an easy access to literals your spaces of the first level to get to inner controls and their you have to either hack the parser using reflection or manipulate the code this way you would get properly built files and temporary is a simplified public partial class is builder of the public class mypagebuilder is where strip white but only of top as between the head and or form and the end of public override void replace some white spaces with you can manipulate the entire generated code using public override void you can the pageparser here using the field at this point is so it be public override void controlbuilder type string string fieldinfo fi string s my it is not worth the

think it makes more sense to say a refactor can be better than a after all if you are rewriting it means you are throwing at that point you are basically flipping a coin as to the bugs you will enter in all the new if you are porting you can often just wrap some chunk of code in a library wrapper and make it available to the software if you reuse then you are just wasting time doing the same thing refactoring your system in treating each interface as a library or service that can be swapped out can often have vast leaps and bounds in terms of performance and

think this depends on whether the framework genuinely solves a for and solves it people always find this a terribly controversial thing to say for some but most of the frameworks considered using ending up ditching halfway through because just easier to write some code to do exactly what i when i have a problem in my i can just go to where the problem is and add a line of code to fix rather than wading through pages of documentation to find the magic configuration if i have a problem with favourite i generally find around for ages when the underlying problem that the framework is supposed to be solving was never that complicated in the first favourite useless frameworks are ones that require lots of configuration and clumsy boilerplate code to do basic tasks such as sending some bytes down a socket or stuffing some parameters into a prepared statement and firing it off to a another of my favourites are the whole raft of especially ones that are or do i want a parser rather than just one parser that always call me victor but amazing how people can turn a regular expression problem into a that there are people who absolutely thrive on things with in them etc so clearly for some people in some a and just missing out in it depends on whether you or your organisation primarily have and things expertese or i suppose i have more of the	
think this is a common case of pattern you check your two they do exactly the same the only thing that changes is the keep things dry and overuse this pattern any here you gain a little bit of but then you also have 2 classes that pull their and probably gonna that is common when you learn a new technology or you want to apply it everywhere happens to every one of even if doing it harms the code readability and keep it response to the author comment on my did not try to make fun of or this is a common i did it many and learned it the hard not only with patterns but also with fancy new buzzword you name authors of the book themselves warn the readers not to overuse and the upvotes in this answer clearly indicate something if for some reason you still want to implement the my humble a superclass for both this superclass would be abstract and should contain the shared rate value of their child strategies and implement the abstract method in each subclass see that both methods are the but to make each concrete strategy always favor immutability as joshua bloch for remove the setter of provincialtaxrate and specify the value on constructor or directly in its create some static factory methods in the strategysuperclass so that you decouple your clients from the implementations or concrete strategies can very well be protected classes a pastie with some code to make the solution a bit more it

this code is keep it this problem with storing the return value of a function in a reference is that you are not allocating the space to actually store the return so you often end up with a reference pointing to a temporary either the temporary return value of the function created by the or a local variable allocated during the function freed at its is true that you must not return a reference on a local variable because this variable will be freed when the function the standard states that the compiler must not free the temporary return value of a function if it is so if your function is returning a float by you can store this value in float the compiler ensures that the actual temporary value returned by the function will not be freed until you are done with your that this behaviour is only valid for references a look at this for more

title was definitely the tip of the hope not way off base here on my testing of wcf services can be done many different using test tools such as microsoft team borland silk mercury or something like loadgen or a custom test my preference is to try to take the approach that done in creating some sort of functional unit test and then feeding data into that while using the test tool to spin up multiple concurrent instances of that test the tooling of most commercial test tools really facilitate this type of testing so its difficult to go wrong the biggest challenge usually grows out of maintaining the test cases and test data to support testing the have any built in counters related to thats actually a blind you can see how many connections are being made to the but this is coarse information and you probably want to know which services are servicing those rumor is that as part of providing a rich hosting environment for will include surfacing performance counters for the hosted we will have to wait and see what actually shakes i needed to instrument a wcf service without impacting the existing codebase look into how much mileage i could get out of a wcf behavior that i could apply to the this custom behavior could likely surface the performance counters you might i would care about results of a functional the caveat is that there is likely some startup which can be probably look to profile the execution of a functional test to get execution metrics but not turn on code profiling during a performance again custom behaviors might be the you could log operational metrics to a database and then report off commercial products like amberpoint and soa software will provide support for this as well performance requests to a wcf i immediately think of especially if your looking to make the request

to going ahead with cryptography is from experience after having seen vulnerabilities in encryption most of the vulnerabilities are due to the same reason the data transfer was protected by encryption with a secret but the key itself was exchanged in an insecure solves the problem of not just secure key but also of secure data protects your sensitive information by using assymmetric key cryptography to exchange the symmetric key used to encrypt information back and once the session has been the symmetric key is generated at and is a shared secret between the client and the it is this key that is used to encrypt all other traffic once the session is ready for transfer of public and private keys are used only to exchange this shared the only known way to compromise the shared key is to compromise the private key that the secret key can then be in it requires negligence or malice on the part of the server you roll your own encryption you must exchange the symmetric in a secure the easiest way to do so is to use the harder way is to implement your own assymmetric key exchange cryptography

typically implement the first it seems to be what the design guidelines the reason immediately but i consider it a good one any implementer of the class should have the same sort of protection against the case where the object is disposed as general in other best not to that whoever is implementing a derived class knows precisely when they can call a certain whose successful execution may or may not depend on whether the object has already been disposed or not ideally this should be documented via xml comments your second i would again stick with the recommended practice of passing especially since used in the core even if you think alternative methods are more i think best to stick to the method used in the framework for the sake of as with all clearly up to you how you want to implement a certain design though unless you have a particularly good reason highly advisable just to stick with in both these it probably do a great deal of harm to utilise some of the alternatives you suggested in your so long as they are used consistently and preferably documented to the

used git to stitch together my own github hosted project and an external ui library that i wanted to the library is hosted in a subversion repository on used and and it worked reasonably the downsides order to keep up to date with the library i had to perform a new commit to update the submodule git hash this is because git unlike are pinned to a particular commit this may not be an actual downside if you actually want to pin a stable i was working with code that was initial pull of a git repo with submodules requires an additional step with submodule this is not an issue for but for others using your code they will have to remember or be told to perform this step before your you use the command line it is easy to screw up your repository with this is because you type add to complete to add but it to add note the trailing if you execute the command with the trailing then it blitzes the submodule and adds all its contained files this is mitigated by using add or just training yourself to delete the slash happened to me enough times that i trained myself to remove commits can mess up git rebase i forget the exact but it is especially bad if you have a submodule and you run a normally with a dirty tree you but submodules are not having several submodule commits in a rebase group also causes the last submodule hash gets committed to the first pick on your and this is pretty tricky to fix this can be worked around with a more careful workflow carefully deciding when to do your submodule but can be a steps to set this up were something along the lines svn clone that as a git project to in your own git run submodule submodule add that out to your own repo this is more or you will have a new directory which in your case would be the geomapping time you need to update the geomapping you would run something svn svn push this updates the git mirror of the add subproject careful with the trailing commit push this pushes the commit that updates the not seen to many tutorials on a git submodule work so i hope this helps you

what a comment from another newcomer to iphone background i was a c programmer about 15 years ago and since then moved around technologies quite a bit now an adobe flex developer in my day by trying to transform myself into an iphone developer i bought a book on iphone sdk development in i also bought in i thought be set with these two but after a couple of days reading and working through exercises it was clear i was hopelessly i bought another book this sdk from the pragmatic bookstore this is a work in progress book but looked for turns out this book took me further a great piece of work the early chapters were paced nicely and i was able to follow along and then all of a sudden they began to assume i could recall perfectly the lessons learnt and the procedures followed in earlier chapters and i began yet again to flounder a little the worst thing i find when trying to learn something from a book is to have to jump around from place to place constantly to make any sense of what meant to be i but bear with i bought another iphone from now this book assumes for a beginner to iphone this book hits the no jumping around necessary and finally i found i was what finding is that all three books in conjunction with one another really seem to provide me with a more complete picture collectively i have a great set of tutorial and reference the book not touched on so much yet but i expect that to be what i need it to be a reference manual for the not need that until much deeper in to the slowly emerging from that horrible at the deep end and i swim very feeling to one where i can at least tread hopefully with a bit more paddling be able to touch the bottom certainly my confidence is returning to address the original question personally if i did this all over i think i would have gained anything by starting out building for the mac first and then to the i would definitely have lost less hair had i bought the apress book first that for me was the book that made complete sense of everything for i think then the sdk pragmatic book was the best this is the path suggested to a colleague and confident a good this

work for a software development company and we have around 100 people working on a of these people are lately management wants to have a better way to rate individual programmers performance so the suggestion was to use bug reports as a the more bug reports on a developer the worse he this seems for more reasons than i can tell it is a subjective way of developers work on different projects of differing in addition if qa is measured for the number of bug reports they generate there will be a lot of discussions about the validity of bug would be a better way to measure developers performance in such a suggestion would be to not use bug reports from qa as a measure and instead use bug reports from like beta testers then when such public bug reports are issued also let qa be measured by after reading some of your excellent responses i was thinking that the general problem with the above described metric is that it is negative reporting bugs it encourage producing good quality i think the problem is that it is two there are the on one side who treat programmers as workers they want metrics then we have the who want to see themselves as artists or disturb me i am i think measuring quality can be done by metrics not without being instead things how a person reacts to willingness to creativity and above all quality of work are important and but mostly not necessarily

would say that the standard approach here is to wrap the class you want to as a protected instance variable and then emulate all the members of the wrapped class in your container you can then mark this class and its appropiate members as virtual so that you can use standard polymorphism features with an example of what i is the class contained in the assembly whose code to which you have no virtual class wrapperclass protected closedclass public object new public void public void whatever assembly you are referencing were designed then all the that you might ever want to access would be marked appropiately but indeed this is unfortunately not the case you can even experienced this issue with the base class in my the wrapper class is the way to go it does have its benefits when the class from which you want to derive namely the modifier of methods you want the user of your class to have access the in the bcl is a pretty good example of

would suggest using the associative array to pass named but keep them in the array without extracting echo a couple of reasons for looking at that you can quite clearly see that referring to one of the arguments passed into the if you extract and notice the you the next will be there scratching your head wondering where this variable came even if you know extracting the arguments to local still a guessing game to a certain it ensures that other code overwrite the you may have written your function expecting only to have arguments named and so in your other you define for later you might want to expand your function to take a new parameter called but forget to change your other so no matter what gets passed in the will always be set to are some benefits to using the array too apply equally to the methods of extracting or leaving in the you can set up a variable at the top of each function called myfunc overwrite all the defaults with the you here if you echo john could even remove all items from which have a corresponding this way you know exactly which variables you

you are using mvc is somewhat you basically have three options for this type of ui mechanic on a web the data in your lists is relatively small and infrequently it can be easiest just to all possible data on the page in the initial request either in something like a javascript array or hidden elements in the page when the value of box a javascript just replaces the contents of box b with the appropriate this all happens without any requests back to the server which makes it very but this method breaks down when the size of your data impacts the response time of the initial page the data in your lists is large or frequently changing the time frame a user would be on the page making a the legacy method is to just have the page get reloaded with the new query arguments when the value of box a code on the adjusts the output based on the new depending on how complex the rest of the rendering code in your page this can be is a variation on option 2 and is basically the answer gave regarding still loading the contents of box b on demand when box a the difference is that only reloading the piece of the page that has changed rather than the entire if your data is small enough to use option probably what i would go with due to its otherwise go with option particularly if already got other ajax related things implemented option 2 is seems to be considered a legacy mechanic by many people these

you can never something from an compiler can forget what you know in detail about the particular instance you what subclass it the debugger knows much more than the so it will tell you what actual type the current instance which is probably what sounds like writing logic that needs to know what type of object using which is not recommended in oop but often required for practical i said in a comment to the you should be clear on what is the base class intuitively restricteduser should be a subclass of user since the name suggests a more specialized having an additional active adjective on in your case this is special since this is a limiting adjective which would let you put user as a subclass of restricteduser totally i would recommend renaming the two to something and nonrestricteduser to avoid the limiting adjective which is the confusing part

you set up a tcp the has to be unique this is to ensure packets are delivered to the right is a further restriction on the side that only one server program can bind to an incoming port number one ip servers have other powers but we need to discuss them at the server a that socket to a on that connections on that there can be multiple connections coming in per the client usually a little a the a client opens the it specifies the ip address and port of the it specify its source port but usually uses zero which results in the system assigning it a free port is requirement that the destination be unique since that would result in only one person at a time being able to use and that would pretty well destroy their business means you can even do such wondrous things as ftp since you set up multiple sessions where the only difference is your source allowing you to download chunks in torrents are a little different in that the destination of each session is usually after all that waffling the answer to your specific question is that you need to specify a free if connecting to a server with a call that specify your source almost certainly be using zero under the covers and the system will give you an unused

you want one set of tables with poolid poolname as thetxi use separate databases rather than multiple tables that all do the same you restrict the variation between the accessing of different pools to the initial you have to recode your selects each or have dynamic other advantages of this approach of a database little bit more admin but not know what your application but really really think carefully before creating all of the tables in one that way madness if performance is the only thing that concerns you need to measure take a representative set of queries and measure their the difference in performance for a single query between the many databases model will be if you have one you can tune the hell out of if you have many you can tune the hell out of all of speak for anyone point is for well tuned there will be practically no difference in performance between the three options in multiple multiple so you can pick the option which is easiest for in the short and long the best option is still one database with as thetxi then multiple depending upon your if you need to know exactly what the difference in performance is between two we give you that you need to set it up and test multiple it becomes easy to throw hardware at it to improve

you want to see code for an existing the game programming gems 5 article referenced in the cowboy programming page comes with a somewhat stripped down version of the code we used for our component system did a fair chunk of the design and implementation of the system described in that need to go back and recheck the which i do right we represent things in a hierarchy in the way you although components lived in a class hierarchy in the runtime representation was a flat components just declared a list of interfaces that they the user could query for interfaces or concrete in your sprite and particle would declare that they implemented the renderable and if we wanted to do something to all just loop through the list of active components and check each not terribly efficient on the face of but it was fine in the main reason it an issue was that it actually turns out to not be a very common things like for added themselves to the render scene at so the global scene manager maintained its own list of renderable objects and never needed to query the component system for similarly with phyics and collision components and that sort of

your strings are very either get your compiler to do it or manually unroll your loop and drop in a memory prefetch instruction or two every way while the cpu is the memory controller can be pulling in the next lines of you save the length of the string when you create it you can skip all the checks for the nul which means you can unroll your loop to operate in bigger chunks and reduce the number of compare and branch although with current branch it honestly make much with great cpu branch the loop will slow down if it has to check the loop counter every time through the loop to decide when to do a memory prefetch so unrolling is still helpful in that best performance the cpu does need to get the branches hinted and where profiling feedback comes in very otherwise the compiler is just making a somewhat educated
