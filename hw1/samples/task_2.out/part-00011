am currently tasked with creating a consistent architecture guide for software we have a lot of smart people doing the right but just not consistently and are using application architecture guide as a starting hence coming up with an application architecture is fairly say straight possibly because i have a couple of years experience as a developer so i have a pretty good understanding of this realm and there are also loads of examples and our organisation has a couple of applications that form 1 or more systems which we then install we thought it would make sense to create a system architecture and an enterprise architecture as and this is where the problems is no consistent guidance out if you search for architecture the stuff that you get back is so different that i am wondering if there is a way to do my understanding of it the system architecture is an abstraction of 1 or more application architectures depicting how they work together to form a an enterprise architecture is a further abstraction showing how your fit into a organisations enterprise and how it interacts with the business it strategy and how it integrats into other systems in the i have it completely there any standards out there where can i find there be or would a system architecture simply be any document in any format which is clearly and easily understandable and useful to its would the seasoned architects think of that approach want to simply list a set of soa related patterns that may be like to make it a little more focused to what we which is the build financial solutions on a service orientated what about does anyone have experience with it at all and is it worth the effort of trying to understand it in systems and application architecture

am dealing with a content editable div and i need to deal with capturing key strokes both before and after the character has been added to the understanding of capturing bubbling is that the event gets captured at the highest level in the dom tree first then passes it while for bubbling it starts at the lowest level and bubbles up the on that i thought that if i added an event listener at the capturing the content of the editable div would reflect the text from the keystroke had been if i add an event listener at the bubbling the text content will contain the character i just seem to be the case whether the event listener is added at the capturing or bubbling the content never includes the most recently typed is a simple test case to try it var div would expect the output of the second function to include the new text after typing a but this seem to be the question is there a way to capture a keystroke event from a content editable div and get the content as it will be the key is i need this for implementing typeahead know that i can stop the event and then use but this breaks down when handling pastes and other types of so that is not a am testing this in firefox i know that ie have an addeventlistener for any capturing bubbling with a contenteditable	
am developing a log parsing service that captures specific security events in the windows event my initial thought was to use but i am not looking for any functionality beyond selecting specific ids already known in some i found that iterating over the entire collection was over 3 times faster at pulling data than querying the data to be pulled will be saved in a sql server since the service will perform this duty i wish to avoid duplicate and i will need a way to find the next entry in the collection that is not already in the i can begin inserting to the database once found that initial was just about to write a binary search to find this entry using the most recent timestamp field from the database and comparing it to the property from an item in the this i can but i am wondering if there is already a method to perform this there a method to binary search through the entries in the

am trying to understand how to implement a code coverage tool using the win32 debugging thinking has been to utilize the debugging to launch a process in debug mode and track what cpu instructions has been after having tracked all cpu instructions i would then use the map file to map it to what source code lines were far as i there would be two ways of knowing what cpu instructions have been be to launch the process in debug mode set all threads in single step mode and let the debugging app note all instructions that has been executed be make a more intelligent approach where you would know a lot more about x86 instructions and basically replace the next branch instruction with a then keeping track of the delta instructions between the two new suggested approaches inspired by with the map file and insert breakpoints for the beginning of each line and let the debug framework be notified every time a breakpoint with the map file binary instrumentation to insert a that get called at entry of each source line avoiding the callback through the debugger a vm technology such as vmware to find out what instructions in a particular process was executed i fully understand this someone validate one of the approaches above or maybe suggest an alternative please note that the use case is code coverage and not performance profiling thus we need to know if each single source line is primary goal no particular plan is in would be to create a simple code coverage tool for delphi to implement a code coverage tool using win32 debugging

am using programming on a current project and have run into a problem when overloading operators the equality and inequality using and visual studio the following assumption was all comparisons to use equals rather than is not a viable especially when passing your types to libraries as reason i was concerned about requiring equals to be used rather than is that i could not find anywhere in the guidelines that it stated it would use equals rather than or even suggest after for overriding equals and i have found the operator tests for reference equality by determining whether two references indicate the same reference types do not have to implement operator in order to gain this when a type is that the data that is contained in the instance cannot be overloading operator to compare value equality instead of reference equality can be useful as immutable they can be considered the same as long as they have the same it is not a good idea to override operator in this iequatable interface is used by generic collection objects such as and linkedlist when testing for equality in such methods as and it should be implemented for any object that might be stored in a generic solution must not require casting the objects from their interfaces to their concrete ever both sides of the are an no overload method signature from the underlying concrete types will match and thus the default object method will be overloading an operator on a at least one of the parameters of the binary operator must be the containing otherwise a compiler error is generated bc33021 not possible to specify implementation on an code and output below demonstrating the do you provide proper operator overloads for your classes when using operator predefined value the equality operator returns true if the values of its operands are false for reference types other than returns true if its two operands refer to the same for the string compares the values of the public interface iaddress string streetname string city string state public class address private string private string private string public string string city state streetname iaddress public virtual string get return set public virtual string get return set public virtual string get return set public static bool operator address overload if both sides of the argument are the same instance or they are if return return public static bool operator address return public override bool use rather than a cast to get a null rather an if the object address address obj as return public override int string composite streetname city return public virtual bool per msdn should return if return return public class static void iaddress address1 new iaddress address2 new public static void iaddress if with the if with side if with side if with both sides overload with both sides overloading with programming in

am working on a group senior project for my university and i have run into a major hurdle in trying to get my code to compiler that we have for our 8 bit atmel microcontroller does not support the new or delete and it does not support the i could program it in but i have to implement an algorithm which i have never done while i have tried c initially i soon realized that i never did pure c trying to model objects with structs and functions is slowing me down since i am so used to the much cleaner the exact wording for my compilers shortcomings can be found overcome them and still use i have considered the following allocate just use templates to generate fixed arrays on the allocate and find some hack to call the constructor for objects once i have allocated the space for placement new an option since new an just use c and suck it its a microcontroller why am i getting find a better compiler which will probably cost second option is the hardest but it would have the biggest pay off in terms of how i can write this i imagine that debugging it could be a huge pain if i get it thinking of creating objects on the copying their bits into the allocated and then zeroing the bits in the object so it call its to do that i would access the bits directly with an unsigned char pointer and the sizeof operator to get the byte sounds terrible and i know if it could work but i am considering i know vtables can be a problem but i intend on having any vtables since it is just an 8 bit can you do when your embedded compiler have operator new or stl

and my company have just spent the last month or so evaluating umbraco to see wehther it would fit our were looking for an open source replacement to a basic in house cms we had was important that the cms was in and was easy for end users and developers to also needed to be customisable and ticked all these boxes and has an active and helpful community surrounding the documentation is not terribly complete or up to date which can make getting started rather particularly for more complex weak is workflow and page but this is being worked on in the commercial version and is really only a concern for larger scale getting to grips with simple sites creative website starter is excellent and gives you a good grounding in how umbraco works and how to implement a simple cms based most important thing to do before starting an umbraco implementation is to plan your document types and content this is because once implemented it can be hard to change document types on pages you have already created and cms projects invariably live and die in the planning phase anyway so this is no different to any other used many many different cms platforms over the reddot etc etc and found umbraco to be fast and has quirks and in some places lacks polish but overall it is an excellent cms for small to medium sites with a bit of for large as have settled on umbraco and are now in the process of migrating our on our legacy to umbraco as well as a brand new

approach would be if there is actually a problem with performance it alreade acceptable to my the performance at each teir long does it take the database to come up with how long does it take the service to respond with how much time does it take from the service to the on the measurements i would then determine where to do my remember the closer to your data storage you do the easier it but the closer to the client you do the better the performance gain remember that caching should not be the first thing to do to improve you should also look into other performance gains as are the stored procedures is there a lot of overhead in the wcf is there some inefficient processing in the do i realy need all that data in one

are a of issues at play terms of pure performance and things like indexes are set up databases are very good at one query in sorting at the the database is probably in practice the database often becomes the bottleneck for an anything you can do to move work away from the database will improve your overall application that includes moving sort operations to a or presentation the presentation tier may not be able to sort one query as but it might be better positioned to handle that overall this is especially true when you can reliably push that work all the way to individual though that can be the other more to consider here than pure you also want to think about future more maintainable than a simple only one line of compared to who knows how much extra programmer work to get a sort working this might be a case where better off throwing some money at the problem to make sure your database is simply able to maintain an level of sorts and here the issue cut and a school of thought that believes sorting really should be considered a function of the presentation tier and that ultimately the presentation tier is also the more maintainable place to do this i subscribe to that but it is out

are considering migration as one reason is but another reason is that vault does not use valid xml for its commit comments so special characters fail our automated ccnet build system a bullet character is one of and specifically causes us a a way around this has been to ask our developers to not use these characters outside the range of ascii 32 and to manually go in and code with a this may not seem like a big but not allowing these characters prevents easy of bug and other comments into the commit this slows people down and anything that hinders flow and productivity and creates frustration needs to be reduced or my it seems that there is no way to directly migrate from vault to perhaps it is possible to use another version control system as a migration middle vault othersourcecontrolproduct i think that we would either script the commits joshua suggested at the beginning of this or which more likely just commit the last few revisions and leave the vault repos around a while for this actually gives us a a good opportunity to clean out and refactor our current code and

are missing the point when thinking about the password to the firebird database the server is open so no way to do what you the user can simply recompile the server with password checking commented only two things you could your own modifications to the firebird so that it writes a database file that is incompatible with all other it matter then that people can transfer the database to another as the standard server executables be able to access the data in the only encrypted data to the so that it matter that access to the database is are of course not as a determined cracker can simply use your own application to get at the having permission to attach a debugger to the running process can be enough to halt execution of your application at any point in time and to examine the data in see also the so question can i increase memory security in especially for more information on this this is something that can be done whatever database engine you to answer the last part of your

are the core principles and motivating forces behind the the extent that used mostly about code reuse and used it before in the guest user admin model and it certainly proves its value when you need to move a user from one group to extend this to having organizations and companies represented with users under and really providing a form of abstraction that particularly inherent in does it prescribe you do to your data bit above pretty high level and quite incorrect in some been on project that used but i working with a separate team on other pretty correct in your bit though it needs some more you can imagine a situation where an entity in the database it a contracts out to another which may in turn subcontract work a party might be an a or a all subclasses of from my you would have a party table and then more specific tables for each which could then be further subclassed person has your experience led you to feel about did you use and would you do so what the pros and has its benefits if you need flexibly to add new types to your system and create relationships between types that you expect at the beginning and architect in moving to a new companies hiring other it also gives you the benefit of running a single query and retrieving data for multiple types of parties on the flip adding additional layers of abstraction to get to the data you actually need and are increasing load at least the number of on the database when querying for a specific if your abstraction goes too likely need to run multiple queries to retrieve the data as the complexity would start to become detrimental to readability and database the party model limit your choice of for did have to eliminate certain orms they allow for enough of between domain objects and your physical is an area that admittedly a bit weak but found that using views and mirrored abstraction in the application layer made this too much of a the real problem for me has always been a is piece of data x when i want to read the data source directly not always intuitive for new developers on the system

auth messages look pretty handy for notifying a cms user of some configuration the thing is that the messages are deleted on every page load if you include the context and you have to include that processor if you want to use the admin tried hacking around it by adding that processor to just after matching the admin url before calling but it appears that already imported the list of processors by that is there any way to do this without changing any of the django core files and without omitting the django auth app from your config entirely until the last possible to show django auth messages only in admin

best bet is to create a property if you in the base class and provides a sort of base something virtual string get return property could stay the or change to something like and you could combine and to form a complete the this probably the best way to go about what is the purpose of naming these it looks to me like using a command pattern in image manipulation and either setting up a chain of actions to or want to keep a chain of actions to such a system would be better suited to a linked list which you could display in some sort of showing the action the name of the or the as defined and the series in which they would be far as your need to use the name to instantiate the not quite sure if this is truly your only two options would be a factory pattern or using reflection on either the name of the class or a custom attribute value could also be used for providing the if if going to be instantiating them the away from guess this is a roundabout way of saying it all depends on how this needs to have to provide more concrete and comprehensive information for a correspondingly concrete and comprehensive

broken a wall that most software developers the one that was blocking your view on usability a lot of developers really think about it and try to make it easier for them by stuffing functionality in one web page or thing is once you start designing software from the point of making it several things start to become one is the issue of code that code is easily more managable to work on if you stuff everything in one giant class or whatever travesty been the other is usability that you start to think how the user is actually using your application through the graphical third is avoiding requirements or scope creep where you stop developing functionality that the user as users want simplicity partly because we want to spend most of our time muddling through a bad ui when we can get our work done faster with a simple and slick that makes it for us software developers the right thing to to think through your design on all that and always

can actually reproduce the behaviour of const in you just have to do it the only way the caller can modify its state is by calling methods on it or setting is of type public void public string get set in your happy for them to get the but not set and definitely not happy about them calling that define an interface describing what allowed to public string get left out the mutating method and only left in the getter on the add that interface to the base list of in your class with the you have a fooclass a property ifooconst get return basically reproduces by hand precisely what the keyword would do in a reference of type foo is like an automatically generated type that only includes those members of that were marked as translating this into some theoretical future version of declare like public void public string get const set all done is merged the information in back into by tagging the one safe member with a new so in a adding a const keyword add much to the language besides a formal approach to this if you had a reference to a fooclass f would only be able to call the const members on that if the definition is the caller could cast an into a but they can do that in too called away and involves a special operator called t also the issue of interfaces not being very easy to evolve between versions of your if a third party may implement an interface you define they are free to do if they can see then you add new methods to it in future versions without requiring others to recompile their but only a problem if you are writing an extensible library for others to build maybe a feature would solve this

can be found through all the obvious methods networking via trade shows and events significant amount of work can also be found via the tendering many and almost all government will outsource their contracts through the tendering if you go to the website of medium to large sized companies and many government you can find a contracts and tenders page with all the work that is currently available for of these companies in turn will also list with either a national or industry specific contracts and tendering which you can subscribe they will also advertise their contracts in newspapers and trade as an if you have never seen it i think you may be surprised just how much work the government needs also note that my use of government does not refer only to central but councils and state governance as of this has a cost of it can quite expensive to tender for a you just send a business card and do a 10 minute many of the contracts have to be seen to be transparent so there can be several rounds to the process all requiring specific forms of supporting documentation basically if you ever end up outsourcing a contract end up paying a proportion of the cost of all the failed tenders that your selected supplier has incurred before meeting but better get yourself a

common called has been built for the runtime like garbage collection and was previously the barrier to phobos and tango interoperating in the same higher level functionality depended on the phobos runtime and likewise for major update to phobos has been released yesterday as a matter of this update tries to make use of some of the new features of d2 and introduces the concept of which are like iterators but easier to work with and more d2 phobos is very different from its underpowered d1 is by far the better standard library for a d2 port is in and will likely progress much more rapidly when d2 is a big question is whether the tango devs will update it to take full advantage of the d2 or whether they will simply focus on making it work with d2 the same way it does with the two phobos tends to focus more on making simple things syntactic convenience and pushing the envelope of what can be done in a standard something of a cross between stl and standard as weird as that tango tends to have more of a feel to more focused on breadth of features and handling unusual use cases it stays more within the sane subset of d as much template though arguably a major feature of d is to promote template metaprogramming to sane subset and takes a more pragmatic approach to api own guess but it makes a lot of is that phobos will become analogous to a truly standard library of core and tango will become a utility kind of like as more of its core functionality is absorbed into phobos as others d1 is supposed to be so nothing is changing

compiler has no way of knowing if a global variable is used it could be used from a compilation unit written in a completely different for	
compiler is optimizing away a variable that is never it cannot optimize a function on the grounds that it will not be as it could be used from a different compilation you could try to force the compiler into considering the variable as used with something akin mark the variable as if it is new return the compiler cannot know if p will be it must better solution would be to explicitly instantiate the template if you want t const value void t const whatever t template implementation another not included from t const value t const v explicit class class 7 linker error not code will only see the header and know what methods but not the real the implementation will be compiled in one compilation where the explicit template instantiation that if you forget to explicitly instantiate one it will be a linker not a compilation one definition one definition rule in states that there can be only one definition for each symbol or having multiple definitions can be detected easily for regular symbols you define two the linker will detect the duplicated but is a little trickier with with templates it is trickier as they are usually declared and defined in header the compiler generates the used symbols in each compilation unit and the linker usually finds more than one equivalent symbol is compiled into each compilation unit that has a and calls compiler flags the templated code as a signifying that while the symbol is defined it can also be defined in another compilation unit and the linker is free to discard the symbol without yielding a link that is a requirement if you want to link different compilation units that make use of the same stl for with the same to gcc gcc linux linker discards all but one of the weak symbols without further some linkers linker in linux will in the near not as know nor it could be alredy do check that the different symbols are in fact the same and provide an to the code is the odr in that you are redeclaring the template in a different you should declare the template once and the implement the methods externally as posted anyway if both definitions are compatible they are in the snippet you all member methods and attributes are exactly the same and with the same qualifiers it should be accepted by the compiler as there is only one definition of the only those methods that are actually called in the code will be void void compiler generates but not

correct and i was stuck with the bloated vhd to but somehow managed to screw that up and lost the is what else i is a great article explaining why differentials are so apparently each byte is written into its own 512 byte sector waisting tons of presentation explains how to use disk compression when storing differencing disks and that undo disks utilize less in placing you differencing vhd or vud into a ntfs compressed folder will save you tons of created a differencing disk for the wssv3 image from microsoft booted it up and installed just the boot processed added 300mb to the installing tortoisesvn added and installing wspbuilderextensions added 1gb to the end result was differential from installing i merged it with the base and resulted in only adding 29mb back to the then created another differential vhd inside a ntfs compressed started it up and created a new wss web application through central the file size jumped up to but only resulted in 90mb on the file system do to the ntfs i then created a renamed to vhd and completed the same the file size increased to 300mb which resulted in 12mb on the file the differential vhd is highly ineffective and has no intelligence it in what so but the bloating allows for some nice development you should also create a new attach it as a secondary drive and move your file here since any and every file io is captured in the differencing or undo

depends on numerous factors the amount of memory your db the size of the rows in the use of a parameterised query and so but generally 10k is not a lot of rows and particularly if the table is well indexed then not going to cause any modern rdbms any sweat at a rule of thumb i would generally only start paying close attention to performance issues on a table when it passes the 100k rows and 500k usually cause much of a problem if indexed correctly and accessed by performance usually tends to fall off catastrophically on large tables you may be fine on 500k rows but crawling on 600k but you have a long way to go before you are at all likely to hit such	
depends on the and on the union char int i remember it depends on the alignment that the compiler puts into the allocated unless you use some special the compiler will put padding into your union with gcc you need to use a pragma union char int can also see it from the disassemble some for 0x00001fd2 push 0x00001fd2 push 0x00001fd3 mov 0x00001fd3 mov 0x00001fd5 push 0x00001fd5 push 0x00001fd6 sub 0x00001fd6 sub 0x00001fd9 call 0x1fde 0x00001fd9 call 0x1fde 0x00001fde pop 0x00001fde pop 0x00001fdf movl 0x00001fdf movl 0x00001fe7 lea 0x00001fe7 lea 0x00001fed mov 0x00001fed mov 0x00001ff0 call 0x3005 0x00001ff0 call 0x3005 0x00001ff5 add 0x00001ff5 add 0x00001ff8 pop 0x00001ff8 pop 0x00001ff9 leave 0x00001ff9 0x00001ffa ret 0x00001ffa the only difference is in where the compiler allocates on the stack 0xd instead of

easiest way to implement a synchronous method asynchronously is to put it into a and use the and methods on the resulting this will run the synchronous method on a threadpool and will return an so you have to implement the guts of you do need to smuggle a little extra data into the returned by you could do that easily by creating an implementation of that delegates everything to an inner but has an extra field to contain the so that when the instance is passed to you can access the delegate to call on after closer reading of your i see that you need to use an explicit thread with com settings you need to do is properly implement almost everything follows from since the will contain all the bits needed for a very but not terribly implementation of it encapsulates all the essential passing a synchronization callback propagating exceptions from async task and returning myasyncresult object object new manualresetevent new asynccallback exception bool int int public asynccallback object arbitrary public int x get return public void lock never invoke any delegate while holding a if public void lock if public object get return public waithandle get return public bool get return public int lock complex to for memory model lock if throw return public bool get lock return static void myasyncresult ar int x simulate lengthy demo work double catch static iasyncresult asynccallback object thread th new myasyncresult ar new return static int myasyncresult mar return will throw exception if one occurred in background static void demo calling we need state or callback for iasyncresult ar int result important for correctness that client code see the otherwise they might access methods like inappropriately or read the class can be made more efficient by not constructing the implementation in the if not but this is tricky to get the and can and should be disposed of in the as should be done with all objects that implement and should check to make sure that it has gotten an implementation of the right class to get a nicer exception than a cast left these and other details out as they obscure the essential mechanics of the async

easy way to map this is turn it into a many to one and store the current id on the vehicle i understand this might be a schema way to trick this would be to create a view that would essentially be the vehicle table plus it would pull the current this way you have to change the you would then map to the view instead of the not sure if defining your own loader would work in this case but its one more option to understand your the easiest way would to be modify the schema and the application to add this additional column one way to fake it would be with a so for join owner on is assume here the current owner has a null end now you change your mapping to map to the view instead of the yes this is a hack but it will am assuming you still need owner to be mapped within another option would be to add a where filter on the class mapping to filter where end date is option you have is to load all the owners and push the business rule that defines the current owner to the application your object might look owner get return null if your using a nullable set

excuse my i only started coding in silverlight tried implementing the command pattern in silverlight and hit a say commands are because you can write them into so you can keep your also you have loose coupling between your view and your viewmodel because there is no direct reference to the viewmodel in the can not keep your because you can bind only one command to a and you have to decide which event will fire your command when you bind if a control has 30 you have to choose one for the other 29 will execute the other commands from event handlers from the code coupling can be achieved more simply by dependency commands add a useless layer of indirection that gives nothing they only make it a bit harder to maintain your it is easier to maintain your when you are programming against an interface and see exactly what method gets then when you have to keep jumping between your command definitions and your i miss or commands are really not meant to be used for view and viewmodel see the following this is why i get all the hype with wpf and silverlight command implementations useless for the

first guess would be differences between in vista and if you are using a cframewnd there is a gripper control in what would be your last pane in the far right of the status it looks as though changes in the may account for giving you a smaller i assume you are just seeing a smaller than you did you are not talking about smaller x and y at the same time are you have you may want to look for the correct version and deploy it with your or make your manifest reflect which version to i have a clear cut but themes are the only thing that come to since if i recall in the gripper was added on top of the status or the status bar was shrunk just enough to display suggestion you could use would be to detect your running version of and made the assumption of the gripper for the the gripper will be the same size as the vscroll so you can naturally remove that many from the last cell at and render text based on have to go home and fire up and see how it acts based on what you are saying have a vista vm handy to see what version of it has installed by but my guess they put some code in it to deal with the you have complete sample that would really make things easier on me i have to start digging for all my old vc6 generated code and go from interesting test would be to call getsystemmetrics on the pieces that we think could have an effect on and see how they differ from system to if you put vista into do you still see the same which machine is your dev vista or

fix is only applicable to rails as giles mentions they fixed this in internally using much the same but beware the json earlier attempt at rails if required explicitly will break everything all over you mean the statement itself raises that or do you mean when you call you get the the latter is what i would if you have a problem requiring the json gem then not sure going just ran into this problem with the oauth in my there is not a true because the oauth gem depend on therefore the problem is that json is clobbering the activesupport i solved this by simply requiring json before activesupport is the did the trick putting it after the block did allows activesupport to clobber the default json implementation if you are using a gem that actually depends on the json implementation of then you are up a this is definitely the worst of and i would advocate for the rails and json gem developers to resolve the though it will be painful because one or the other will have to break backwards the short gem authors may be able to bridge the gap by supporting both this is more or less feasible depending on how the gem uses the a worst case scenario is an official fork and

found this question very interesting since i had recently done some work on modeling projectile motion with you are essentially updating the position and velocity using an euler where each new value for the states should be a function of the old in such a you should be updating the position then updating the there are more realistic physics models for effect of drag one model by involves a drag force that is proportional to the velocity as which generally applies to low velocity the one i previously suggested involves a drag force that is proportional to the of the velocity as quadratic which generally applies to high velocity address each one with regard to how you would deduce formulas for the maximum velocity and the time required to effectively reach the maximum forego the complete derivations since they are rather equation for updating the velocity would acceleration represents the following differential a the first entry in integral we can find the solution v 0 at t maximum velocity occurs when t so that the second term in the equation is very close to zero the time needed to reach the maximum note that the equation never truly reaches but instead asymptotes towards when the argument of the exponential equals the velocity is around of the maximum probably close enough to consider it you can then approximate the time to maximum velocity can then use these two equations to solve for and given a desired and equation for updating the velocity would acceleration represents the following differential a the first entry in integral we can find the solution v 0 at t maximum velocity occurs when t so that the exponential terms are much greater than 1 and the equation the time needed to reach the maximum note that the equation never truly reaches but instead asymptotes towards when the argument of the exponential equals the velocity is around of the maximum probably close enough to consider it you can then approximate the time to maximum velocity is also equivalent a desired and the second equation for will tell you what should and then you can plug that in to the equation for to get the value for seems like a bit of but these are actually some of the simplest ways to model anyone who wants to see the integration steps can shoot me an email and send them to they are a bit too involved to type i immediately realize but the updating of the velocity is not necessary anymore if you instead use the formulas i derived for if you are simply modeling acceleration from and you are keeping track of the time since the acceleration the code would look something is one of the two formulas for and you would no longer need a velocity in there is a calculating may be more computationally expensive than simply updating velocity with an iterative scheme to the exponential but it is guaranteed to remain stable and under certain conditions trying to get a very short the iteration can become unstable and a common problem with the forward euler maintaining limits on the variables 0 should prevent these if feeling somewhat you may be able to integrate the formula for to get a closed form solution for thus foregoing the need for a newton iteration leave this for others to

george said working effectively with legacy code is the bible for this kind of the only way others in your team will buy in is if they see the benefit to them personally of keeping the tests achieve this you require a test framework with which is as easy as possible to plan for other developers you take your tests as examples to write their if they do not have unit testing expect them to spend time learning a they will probably see writing unit testings as slowing their development so not knowing the framework is an excuse to skip the some time on continuous integration using cruise cdash if your code is automatically compiled every night and tests run then developers will start to see the benefits if unit tests catch bugs before thing to encourage is shared code if a developer changes their code and breaks someone test they should not expect that person to fix their they should investigate why the test is not working and fix it in my experience this is one of the hardest things to developers write some form of unit some times a small piece of code they check in or integrate the make integrating these into the build easy and developers will start to buy approach is to add tests for new and as code is sometimes you cannot add as many or as detailed tests as you would like without decoupling too much existing err on the side of the only place i insist on unit tests is on platform specific where are replaces with platform specific higher level these must be tested on all platforms with the same this saves loads of time adding new use to structure our the simple self registering functions make writing tests are wrapped in ctest of this runs a group of unit tests executables at once and generates a simple nightly build is automated with ant and luntbuild glues and java i hope to add automated deployment and functional tests to the

get comfortable with lots of different and know how to get your hands dirty and write it develop some favorite ways to but get a good understanding for what the tools can and what they and also develop an eye for when is the right time to use a and when is the right time not found that jsf and facelets are definitely worth the if you can survive the learning pretty but when you figure it very easy to work they make managing session and application scope objects much easier to deal with than just raw jsp and and found that i can write cleaner java when i have to think about the web in the business in i find that the frameworks help me to organize my thoughts by my in a easy to understand in is my favorite web template i love the fact that my pages are and that i have scriptlets all over the it makes the code much cleaner and easier to follow you know the that learning curve the adding ajax to facelets is easy if you use something like richfaces or they have ajax components that you can easily add to your not the best for all and so at the end of the using any framework is a judgment if not helping you solve your then not worth fight with your use them if the tool is in your use a different jsf and facelets are really not very good choices on a very small they really come into their own until you have a fairly complex domain model and complex business you need the project to be complicated enough to overcome the amount of boilerplate code you need to write to get

graphs model intuitively model computer networks and the often nodes will represent or while edges represent connections between these any data structure that makes use of pointers to link data together is making use of a graph of some this includes tree structures and linked lists which are used all the and trying to find shortest or longest paths from some location to a destination makes use of this can include pathing like you see in an application like google or calculating paths for ai characters to take in a video and many other similar a common problem in ai is to find some goal that satisfies a list of for for a university to set course it needs to make sure that certain courses that a professor teaching two courses at the same that the lectures occur during certain and so constraint satisfaction problems like this are often modeled and solved using graphs can be used to model atoms and molecules for studying their interaction and structure among other

guy that did aforge did a fairly good job but not commercial great to learn from but you can tell he was learning too so he has some pretty serious mistakes like assuming the size of an image instead of using the correct bits per not knocking the i respect the heck out of him for learning all that and show us how to do i think a now or at least about to be so really smart just not a commercially usable library has its own weirdness when working with fourier transforms and complex if not it outputs the fourier transform in human viewable format which is nice for humans if you want to look at a picture of the transform but not so good when you are expecting the data to be in a certain format normal i could be mistaken about that but i just remember there was some weirdness so i actually went to the original code they used for the fourier stuff and it worked much also had some other funkyness i like when dealing with the data from the i remember what it was i just know it was much easier to get what i wanted out of the exocortex dsp not a mathematician or engineer to those guys it might make perfect i use the fft code yanked from which is based without anything else and it works i know not but started looking at using fftw and this guy already made a wrapper so i was going to check it out but actually used it i know if you are doing this for school or work but either way there is a great free lecture series given by a stanford professor on itunes

have two boxes on a selecting an item in the first box will determine what should appear in the second ajax some cases there can be a large 500 items in the second select and it takes time seconds to update in firefox seems to work wonder if there is a faster way to achieve currently the server creates a string passes it to the client which is then broken up and add each item to the select by creating an option element and then adding it to the did try to create the whole select item as a string on the server and add that to the form but for some reason it work in firefox way to populate with

have two tables in my sql problem is that i would like to have a employee id that is relative to the they belong i got this dilema since really been searching what would be the cleanest way to implement option would be to just make a kind of select from employees where but the problem would be that if i happen to delete the last employee the next one would be created with the id of the ideas or the reason of why i want to do this is that i dont want a user from company x create an employee that is for example while the last employee created in his company this would normally happen in a system in wich company y and z also create employees on the same i want this id not to use as a but to have it for internal documents or in this case the employees will never have to change vs employee id

i have a legacy php4 system that i continuously need to add features it look like there will be resources to do a port to php5 for several months if not several over the course of the past few one of the major things that has bothered me is not having the ability to throw exceptions because of all kinds of error checking code has to constantly interrupt the flow of going on to the what is the best strategy that you have seen to emulate the cleanliness of exception handling in languages that have no exception has this to say regarding exceptions as noted in an create too many possible exit points for a to write correct you really have to think about every possible code path through your every time you call a function that can raise an exception and catch it on the you create opportunities for surprise bugs caused by functions that terminated leaving data in an inconsistent or other code paths that you think better alternative is to have your functions return error values when things go and to deal with these no matter how verbose it might it is true that what should be a simple 3 line program often blossoms to 48 lines when you put in good error but and papering it over with exceptions does not make your program more i think the reason programmers in style languages have been attracted to exceptions is simply because the syntax does not have a concise way to call a function that returns multiple so hard to write a function that either produces a return value or returns an a good exception model in a language makes the called function specify that it will in fact throw an this implies that there are exaactly zero additional places for the function to exit from code would just return false instead of throwing an but there is exactly 1 additional place for the function to exit the catch block of the calling anyone write sloppy code that passes all exceptions upward to be dealt with by others but that mean you take away a tool that can be used cleanly and any function can return a value that is out of range of the expected return values from the calling a good programmer is going to deal with all possible return including error codes and the exception model just gives him a way to do it alternative exception handling

i the bounds rectangle actually is always the same size as the frame and has the origin relative to the frame rectangle coordinate for some reason the bounds rectangle appears to be smaller than the frame the content will be clipped while the frame rectangle uses larger space than what would if the bounds rectangle is bigger than the frame it valid to think about frame rectangle and bounds rectangle in the way of an html div container absolute positioned and has an and in css see any reason why it would make sense to have a bigger bound another problem raises up from the positioning of the bound relative to the frame rectangle coordinate so even if both have the same if the bounds rectangle is not positioned in the origin at do we have a big problem what it make sense that the bounds rectangle of an uiview can be bigger than the frame

i try to replicate the without being able to replicate the error it is basically impossible in a program to guess the if break out the code in a separate standalone there are several reasons for if the original project is big it quite difficult to debug second it eliminates or highlights any assumptions about the normally always have another copy of vs open which i use for the debugging parts in mini projects and to test routines which i later add to the main having reproduced the error in the separate module the battle is almost it is not easy to break out a piece of code so in those cases i use different methods depending on how complex the issue in most cases assumptions about data seem to come and bite me so i try to add lots of asserts in the code in order make sure my assumptions are i also disabling code by using until the error eliminating dependencies to other modules sort of slowly circling in the bug like a vulture think i have really a conscious way of doing it varies quite a lot but the general principle is to eliminate the noise around the issue until it is quite obvious what it hope i sound too confusing

is more likely an issue of not initializing variables to some initial so in debug they have some sort of but in most things are initialized zero some may be taking that you do not without your source code for really hard to spot has bit me more than is assuming you are not expecting to see anything using stuff like as make sure your packets are under 1024 bytes in or you will not get took me a while to figure this one out back when xp came and i figure out why my code worked on but not even though send would return it never actually sent the dealt with udp a lot on so if you give me some example code i should be able to help check that all your variables are initialized to some sort of default value on both the sender and the is just good and then it and try check your packet size with a before it and if greater than 1024 also a good idea to check size of the received and if not exactly the size you then drop the this holds more true for but still me know if any of this i posted a lot of udp code on here a little while and that code you might want to refer to

is nothing especially about function they allow you to call a function which is specified at but you have exactly the same overhead as get from any other function call the additional pointer since the function to call is determined at the compiler can typically not inline the function call as it could anywhere as function pointers may in some cases add up to be significantly slower than a regular function pointers have nothing to do with and should never be used to gain they are a very slight nod to the functional programming in that they allow you to pass a function around as parameter or return value in another simple example is a generic sorting it has to have some way to compare two elements in order to determine how they should be this could be a function pointer passed to the sort and in fact can be used exactly like if you ask it to sort sequences of a type that does not define the less than you have to pass in a function pointer it can call to perform the this leads us nicely to a superior in not limited to function you often use functors instead that classes that overload the so that they can be as if they were functors have a couple of big advantages over function offer more with destructor and member they can maintain and they may expose other member functions that the surrounding code can are unlike function whose type only encode the signature of the function variable of type may be function which takes an int and returns we know which a type encodes the precise function that should be called a functor is a call it we know that the function to call and will always and this means the compiler can inline the function the magic that makes the generic just as fast as your sorting function designed specifically for your the compiler can eliminate all the overhead of calling a are very little type safety in a function you have no guarantee that it points to a valid it could be and most of the problems with pointers apply to function pointers as dangerous and pointers or functors or delegates all solve the same with different levels of elegance and they allow you to treat functions as passing them around as you would any other you can pass a function to another and it will call your function at specified times a timer when the window needs or when it needs to compare two elements in your far as i know i could be because i worked with java for java have a direct you have to create a which implements an and defines a function it for and then instead of calling the function the shape of a function functor or you call similar to the implementation in but without the generality of and without the function syntax that allows you to treat function pointers and functors the same that is where you use function when more sophisticated alternatives are not available you are stuck in and you need to pass one function to the most common scenario is a you define a function f that you want the system to call when x so you create a function pointer pointing to and pass that to the system in forget about john carmack and assume that anything you sees in his code will magically make your code better if you copy he used function pointers because the games you mention were written in where superior alternatives are not and not because they are some magical ingredient whose mere existence makes code run

is some real abuse of terminology going on in the question and the there is no cast in this and especially this is a major concession to java sacrificing some type has no basis in scala cast looks like you see above is an assignment is legal because there is an implicit conversion from to i emphasize is not a a cast is an arbitrary assertion which can fail at there is no way for the implicit conversion to problem with depending on implicit conversions between and the answer to the original is that implicit conversions only take place if the original value type since perfectly legal to match on a no conversion takes the match just

is to do with how overloaded methods are the compiler first looks at the declared type of the expression in this case and looks for candidate methods are first declared in that if there are any methods which are appropriate where all the arguments can be converted to the parameter then it look at any parent this means that overridden where the initial declaration is in a parent get a if there are any appropriate methods in the derived a slightly simpler public virtual void derived public override void public void static void derived d new prints even though the compiler knows there is a matching method with a parameter of type and the argument is type and the conversion from to is than the conversion from to the fact that only the method is originally in means the compiler ignores is highly surprising i can see why it would be the case if override otherwise introducing a more method in the base class could change the behaviour unexpectedly but clearly here about as overriding this is one of the points where i believe the designers made the wrong

is where comes in very the idea i understand it at very new to is that the window itself is bound to a the viewmodel class is just a class that represents all the data in a way that your entire page has access to everything it simply brings together all the different objects need to bind to in one you set the datacontext of the window to an instance of this your userinfo and userinfoextended instances are public properties of the viewmodel and you just use the path of your binding element to get you through the appropriate properties of the appropriate objects you wish to bind each control a great quite video explaining this and it goes through a full example that illustrates many ways to accomplish this and many different reasons why this is a convenient and scalable model to use in a wpf it also covers many features of wpf as well as an introduction to dependency which are very relevant topics as given the a link to the blog post which contains a link to the video speaking

learned x86 assembler from a book about the 8086 i remember the name of at it was obviously quite and if really interested i can dig it up when i get that will only teach you 16 bit for the more advanced 32 bit stuff i read some tutorials never done 64 at least at the os targeting probably as too the bios is all you really care if you have access to a test an emulator is probably a good as others have but you can also build yourself an 8088 or 8086 without too much trouble from discrete you can find tutorials and circuit diagrams online it should cost less than and a great learning experience essentially building a motherboard from not too attached to x86 assembly and want to learn i recommend the pic you can pick up a starter kit for less than pickit which i even works under they have extensive documentation and plenty of tutorials aimed at

linq on a pipes and filters is a api meaning that data is lazily returns as you ask for it iterator rather than loading everything at and returning a big buffer of means that your qry from row in source where select new qry new you enumerate over it will consume the data you can see this graphically with jon the only things that break the pipe are things that force for high volume jon and myself worked on for doing aggregates without buffering in such by most orm tools entity is a slightly different because the database engine is going to do most of the heavy the chances are that most of the steps are already done all that is left is to consume an and project this to but that is still typically a pipe implements unless you call regard to use in is that it is fine to use to write composable queries inside the but they the repository as that would make the internal operation of the repository subject to the so you would be unable to properly unit test profile optimize taken to doing clever things in the but return this also means my repository stays unaware of the is a shame as the temptation to from a repository method is quite for this would allow the caller to add but remember that they actually consumed the data this makes resource management a in mvc etc need to ensure that the calls or so that it the view that is controlling data access you unit test the controller use of filters in the dal would be things string ctx new qry qry qry return added filters but nothing happens until we call at this the data is obtained and returned the in the this can be fully unit if we did something similar but just returned the caller might do something var custs all of a sudden our dal starts failing translate to you can still do a of interesting things in the only pain point here is that it might push you to have a few overloads to support different calling patterns until i find the best answer here is to use extension methods on the that i only need one concrete repository customerrepository public string string icustomerrepository string string class customerrepositoryextensions public static this icustomerrepository string string return we have virtual overloads extension on so our caller can use without having to specify the without using pipes and filters becomes a lot more be writing some kind of text based query you can obviously append but it very the is a bit better but not as elegant as

members must be declared virtual if you use lazy loading because nhibernate will create proxy objects for your entities at so do not use lazy loading or just declare the event as virtual that is not so but it is creates proxy classes for all lazy loaded entities and uses them where an entity is referenced but not yet accessing this proxy triggers loading the real entity from the this approach requires to inherit from your entity class at runtime and override the public members hence this members to be there is another you can add to the class then you do not need virtual members while proxys just implement the given

merging and the thing i find amazing about most uses of version control is that of the people using it know how to use it to support two different branches at the same time they use it as a linear versioning system when they check in the real power of version control is that it allows you to effectively maintain two separate versions of a system at the same time which is something that comes in handy when you have to simultaneously support a production version and develop a new version of a piece of learning how to use a tool like subclipse eclipse plugin for or a tool like git to merge changes between branches is something i wish more people using version control knew how to

most common reasons and use cases for generics are described in the msdn documentation mentioned one benefit of generics like to add is that they can enhance the tool support in the development refactoring tools like those integrated in visual studio or resharper rely on static type analysis for providing assistance while as generics usually add more type information to your object there is more information for such tools to analyse and to help you a conceptual generics help you solving concerns independently from your application regardless whether you are developing a financial application or a book you will sooner or later need to maintain collections of be it books or the implementation of such collections usually needs to know little to nothing about the things to be maintained in those the generic collections shipped with the framework are a primary example for a generics use

my and depending on your a one on one translation is not really the right approach to go consider why you want to move to and evaluate whether you really want to commit to a powerful but quite a steep learning curve and to be really worth it you need to take the time to look at the user experience and see how wpf can if you want to have the winforms look and and just move to wpf because the next new in for an unpleasant what done while migrating our winforms stuff is to make new screens in and keep hosting the old winforms screen using and these work really well by the way we had any problems with them so we then migrated screen by screen to looked like a frankenstein in the mean but at least we had regular feedback and everything was

new to but my impression good jvm integration will be the driving jruby can call java and java can call jruby but explicitly calling into another not the clean integration of so you can use java and even mix and match in the same started looking at scala when i had a realization that the thing which will drive the next great language is easy the jvm has good concurrency from a performance sure someone will say that erlang is but scala is actually usable by normal java falls down is that just so painfully it takes way too many characters to create and pass a scala allows passing functions as possible in java to create a union or to apply an interface to an existing these are both easy in typing usually has a big penalty of scala eliminates this downside while still giving the upside of static which is compile time type and it makes code assist in editors ability to extend the this has been the thing that has kept lisp going for and that allowed ruby on

object in session from a past context be set as another parent since other object is in a new i have a user in session that i had retrieved from a now the page that context has been and a new context is new not in same i would like to do check context not from user in session to new idea is that if the object in session does not belong to the current reload it from the database so that it is now by the same context as every other object in the current am using a context per i did this temporarily until i can get a better idea of how to fix sessionuser sessionuser usercheck sessionuser idea is to see if the object in session is the same as the one the now the if works just first time the context is that should hit the database and grab the once obvious they are not the same and the sesionuser is now the user in the next time that if is the sessionuser and the usertocheck are the still is the usercheck hits the this is not a good this may be the answer after i had forgotten this is an property of type when you execute an will always hit the backing what they if you to execute a database use an is there a way to check if the context has an	
objects do not have so if you come across a shape object in your recursion then it have any dynamic texfields inside it flash objects inside it as children for that might be confusing you is thinking that grouping objects on stage makes a it does the of objects on stage only exists in the flash editing interface for easy editing and once you publish they are not actually grouped in the may even be more confusing is that when you have multiple vector items on or even in some situations bitmap items on flash will just simplify flattened to a single shape this furthers the illusion that grouping objects creates a shape object with each one as a and therefore that a shape object could have but in reality all it did was flatten it all into one single shape with those graphics drawn flat onto it hold any of them as individual and that situation never happens with a dynamic so quite if you hit a shape object then there a dynamic textfield move on

of a general answer you can apply a few examples of where a tool is if you then find yourself lacking a reason to use that because similar examples never arise for then forget about it may just not be applicable to your all the data you are manipulating is in the then maybe you need linq to objects at the other it may be that thinking of it as a way of doing some extra manipulation on data from the and so missing opportunities to tighten up the expressiveness of your code that has nothing to do with the reading a file consisting of lines of plain lines it now contains an array of but arrays support so we can use linq methods on suppose you want to remove the lines with nothing in nonblanklines suppose you wanted those strings in quotes implementation need to escape existing quoted line like to line up successive operations with the aligned under each unless going to do something else with the do quoted line then suppose i want this all turned into a single string separated by a method in string called that can do if i turn it all into an array quoted line we can use a linqy way of doing quoted line a no big deal to fill in a few blanks where you find no existing operator for what you need sometimes there turns out to already be one big one that is missing is an opposite to which taken to calling for item item yield return comes in very handy when got a linked of the kind that crop up occasionally in object an example is which allows exceptions to form a linked with the innermost one at the suppose we want to display the message from the innermost exception of i helper method converts the linked list into an allowing other linq methods to work on it just needs to be given a lambda to tell it how to get to the next item from the current this will get you or maybe you need more or maybe you literally never manipulate any data that sourced from the

of support for but i have to every language has plusses and minuses achieve a better balance than of being for a first convinced most people will learn to more effectively with a language that have an cycle is inherently slower for you as the programmer has garbage collection has good runtime best of if there is an interactive evaluator as to mess about not is almost invariably faster in such there are fewer things to trip you and there are better tools to help figure what went wrong when it to say learning the vagaries of memory management in a language like something worth it just the place you really want to issue with is that for all its practicality the sheer size of it added to the fact it has incompatible parts that can lead to subtle issues best avoided as a john d brings up the point in a comment that some people who learn first on a language is by no means limited to never learn pointers this is a red some people fail to learn all sorts of for all sorts of i maintain that worrying about pointers is a distraction when learning the at some point you may well need to learn about manual memory but not fundamentally important to do this at or more the gains made by avoiding this are more important than the me be clear not saying that is an inferior choice for a first language because it lacks garbage just one of many issues that get in the way of learning the fundamentals of programming the real problem is that it is a large complicated with quirks all over the place and even internal inconsistencies pointers and exceptions play well of course all of this can be managed properly and you can learn good practice to keep from getting in none of this will make much sense to a real neophyte at so some of learning it will end up being it this not that i said so you understand the details hardly an auspicious bigges gains for learning a first language though are probably in avoiding a cycle any and having good

only issue with code coverage and unit tests is that unit tests only test what they were originally designed to and by are code and prone to the same functional that plagues regular are only good for what they are written and after a not high quality unit tests will obviously provide some these are my important factors for software of external data interface points of unit tests on underlying implementations such as of external implementation interface point such as of volume of code a system lives in it is exposed to a greater variety of data inputs as the dataset it has collected this by definition exposes the codebase to a greater number of edge cases and can be mitigated by the quality of the data error and unit also the moving targets of the underlying environment that the system operates one way to moderate this is to put the application in a the system implements i could see the codebase facing a greater chance of failure as more plugins are code elegant if probably going with the simple point here that the more code there the less likely it is that it is well but i suppose it could be turned my codequality would probably involve the metric of what the code coverage in the unit tests you could run a static analysis program against it to determine potential bugs and that would probably be some help as i at some really hard to score because code should be weighted a lot heavier than a and refactoring ought to be figured but only where there are evidences of software the a my contribution to

others have suggested various changes like adding a view let me concentrate on the various criteria for a good the more abstract and loosely coupled the architecture the more extensible it this is exactly why others have recommended you use a view layer which would abstract out the presentation layer templates for each pair into its own this goes with the more extensible the architecture the more maintainable it is that with a grain of salt because it is not always the consider adding a model layer below your model logic this would help you swap out your data access logic from the model business the downside to the architecture you have posed is that you really need to invest in security since all your code is in that file has a lot of responsibility and any changes to it may result in a potential security this necessarily you just need to be aware of the your architecture is balanced and seems very since you have it broken down by you can add caching at any layer to improve adding an addition data access model layer will also help you cache at the layer closest to the experiment with each architecture and be afraid to make it already seems like you have a good understanding of the only way to get better at architecting is to implement and test it in the

portmanteau of and is a strategy which attempts to meet criteria for rather than to identify an optimal a satisficing strategy may often be optimal if the costs of the process such as the cost of obtaining complete are considered in the outcome decisions in software engineering are easy enough to take without pondering for hours on the the first solution that comes to mind is usually good so we can quickly use that and proceed to the next there are also those rarer cases in software engineering when you have to solve a more difficult and or critical those problems can cost you a lot of money or time when solved in a suboptimal those cases i am usually trying to come up with several completely different solutions approaches of solving the then pick one and refine it until i am fully satisfied with my this but sometimes i can only come up with one but not really i am aware that my solution is not very good and the problem is critical enough to warrant some more knowledge of the solution i already found blocks my so i just find a second one least not right i am stuck with my mediocre idea unless i can ask someone i have to implement it to move there also techniques to overcome the two things i can think of is holding a brainstorming session with someone else or going for a do you do in those there any strategies to avoid

practice found very helpful is the idea of making your test suite to the code being that means that the tests are arranged in the same order as the lines of code they are this makes it very easy to take a piece of code and the test suite for that look at them and step through each line of code to verify there is an appropriate i have also found that the mere act of enforcing isomorphism like this forces me to think carefully about the code being such as ensuring that all the possible branches in the code are exercised by or that all the loop conditions are given code like cacheinfo if mcacheinfo test suite for this function would have the following in

problem i have is have a table an with the following have a method called which does the int value value value i want to avoid is the following a calls method and gets the value b calls method and gets the value a increases value by 5 b increases value by 5 a saves value b saves value the record has a value of 10 when it should have been i want to force is the a calls method and gets the value b calls method but has to wait because a already called a increases the value b is still a saves the value has value of b can now read the value b increases the value b saves the the record has a value of which is the outcome looking solved this problem in the past using a static class and putting a lock on a static object created within the constructor of that thus funneling all the work through one static which forces other calls to wait in afraid however that this also think that the the highest isolation level for a transaction do the trick either because it will allow the read in step 2 of the unwanted example suppose another solution would be to create my own lock table and record the locks but that seems like it be developing this project with and sql server does the hive mind dibs on a table

problem is likely to be that your code is running on assuming that doing this using the standard jquery method of running code on and not using the onload in any even using jquerys will be too slow if you have a lot of other javascript files to as the event fired on the document until all javascript includes have should be able to work around the issue by including your code that modifies the table just after the html for the table in your page and not running it on load make sure you wrap it in this approach to you will need to have all javascript required by the code which is modifying the table included earlier in the you have other javascript files you should try to include them later in the not sure how being inside an update panel will affect it you will need to make sure that your code is being when the updatepanel but i believe this should all happen

proper way is to look at the http header sent to the this contains the weighted list of languages the user has configured their browser to this header is not available for reading inside all you get is which tells you what localised version of the web browser was this is not necessarily the same thing as the preferred on ie you instead get systemlanguage installed browserlanguage as and userlanguage configured os which are all similarly i had to choose between those sniff for falling back to and only after that those match any available looking at and finally you can put a script somewhere else on the net that simply reads the header and spits it back out as a javascript file with the header value in the you could include a pointing at that external service in the and use javascript to parse the language i know of any existing library code to do since parsing is almost always done on the server you end up you certainly need a user override because it will always guess wrong for some often easiest to put the language setting in the url vs and let the user click links between the sometimes you do want a single url for both language in which case you have to store the setting in but this may confuse user agents with no support for cookies and search

quick the stl and boost headers do indeed belong in the precompiled header even though these header files define template generating a precompiled header a compiler parses the header text significant and converts it into a binary format that is optimised for the though the template classes will be instantiated when other files are they will be instantiated from information in the precompiled which is significantly faster for the compiler to thing that you should include in a precompiled header are files that are part of your project and are changed even if every single file includes these reason is this the generation of the precompiled header can take a long because the stl and windows libraries are very might have a simple file that everything if is included in and one developer touches then every developer has to wait until the precompiled it would be much faster if was left out of the precompiled and parsed along with each

recommendation is sending simple key name value pairs if you need to stick completely to an ascii text type the key name is used to describe the name of the field that each value conveys similar to original you can send data in a binary tagged format such as tagcodenum is perhaps a byte or word and length is a byte or word depending on your the idea of this format is that the receiver can recognize fields that it understands by the code number and then can also skip tags it know how to in this the encoding becomes if you need multiple tags grouped into logical i would wrap a group of these binary coded tags in an overall message the tag above is a replication of the previous tag construction described above and length describes the byte length of all the tags combined if you think about this not a whole lot different than an xml type structure but it is a lot more concise and constrained so that it is nearly trivial to

respect to your needing to reference the business layer from the i would agree that this is probably not optimal lower tiers should not know about the ones above it reduces reusability and adds circular you considered having your business entities themselves and do their own persistence operations using the dal rather than the dal acting like a factory for them in your current that your dal would be a more direct representation of the and the business entities would contain the logic needed to fill and persist themselves the layer you spec out really appear to me to contain business it looks to me to be more of a persistence services layer for the a variation of what you propose could referencing business contains interfaces and classes with business references dataservices contains classes that find and persist can serve up structures containing the data transfer that can be consumed and processed by business references which simply provides classes that map to on your i would consider merging your businessentities and dataservices in your original into a single the only reason i can think of to split them apart is if you are doing something like silverlight where you need asynchronous data operations on business course all of this is with an incomplete knowledge of your specific system requirements you will need to design what is best for your specific good	
response to error where pages are delivered considering a switch from apache tomcat to this is inspired not by but by frustration with a fault that just go questions we use glassfish in cooperation with or replace apache the interface between apache and tomcat is clearly somehow connected to the error and the last thing we need is to have the same problem turning up on the flip we will have need of which apache is already set up to we use glassfish 2 or version 3 seems to be a complete and comments here and elsewhere suggests that a lot of people are sticking with well can apache and glassfish cooperate on the same for apache could simplely all requests to selected domains over to glassfish opposed to the much more specific proxying to tomcat that doing at the there an easier hate to do all this work for this question belong on from tomcat to

run into similar things in my two things found with that helped me the be afraid necessarily of memory allocations are very so allocating an array on the fly can often be faster than making an whether this will help depends a lot on how using the the only pitfall i see is if you return a fixed size array going to have to check for edge cases in the routine using your on how large your matrix of squares is in your you may be better off doing 1 check up front to see if on the and if precomputing the full array and returning if on an you can handle those special cases separately a 1 or 2 element array as this would put one larger statement in but that is often faster in my if the model is i would avoid precomputing all of the the overhead in the squares may outweigh the my as preallocating and returning using yield makes the jit more likely to inline your which can make a big difference in if you can take advantage of the ienumerable results and you are not always using every returned that is but precomputing may be other thing to consider i know what information is saved in square in your but if hte object is relatively and being used in a large matrix and iterated over many consider making it a i had a routine similar to this hundreds of thousands or millions of times in a and changing the class to a in my sped up the routine by over this is assuming using as the jit does many more optimizations on structs in the latest are other potential pitfalls to switching to struct of but it can have huge performance

schemas are often identified with a uri and while they may be formatted similarly there is no guarantee that there is anything there because it is not a ability to identify the correct xml schema is necessary if you must validate an xml a means of identification must be shared between the content and the schema authors before successful validation can mean anything uris fill this need as good as anything keep in mind that the schema is not necessarily needed in order to make use of the xml therefore it does not need to be universal locatable or it simply needs to be the semantics of a uri avoid the implication that the resource must be located as would be the case with a and with good such a detail is irrelevant to the task of publishers will often base the uri off of a url which they i can imagine there are many reason for doing but for it helps avoid naming conflicts without an when using such a convention it is hard to resist hosting the definition at the location the uri would point to if it where a while by know means i believe doing so marks an appreciated and is an example of good information but this fact remains unrelated to needs filled by a

second approach is more and it is clear when reading the code that the function has no preconditions on the argument does not have an and that it will actually create an object the first approach is not so clear for the casual the call implies that the object will be changed by but it is not so clear if there are any preconditions on the passed the the code you posted is not using the assignment but rather copy the defines the value that is implemented in all major if you are not sure you can run the following snippet in your x const x const x const const x return x x you will get a single line the compiler reserves the space in the stack for the then calls the function that constructs the over fact the operations inside are applied directly on being equivalent to your first code snippet by you were not using the copy constructor you x then it would create both and and apply the assignment yielding a three line so it could be a little less efficient in

showing a modal dialog via which happens in a vbscript function page shown is like to do some resizing of the window based on the number of rows in a datatable coming so naturally i go to register a startup script that resizes the window based on the number of that so i tried to register a script that just showed a code looks like the onload event if sub msgbox end if throw new to load me it looks like this should work and show a message box that says when the page loads got the onload event set to but what happens is no no tried every type i could think of in the typeof nothing seems to the only thing i can think of is that since the dialog is a modal run but that make any sense to put the msgbox call into my script block directly and the alert so but i need to modify some arguments in the code behind so i have to use registerstartupscript as far as i can showmodaldialog interfere with	
simple approach would be to use a instead of a the dictionary is essentially an associative array of item pairs and support retrieval of its keys as an to use the dictionary you will need to add a reference to the microsoft scripting the drawback to using the dictionary is that it is not enumerable in the same way as the a more elaborate solution would be to wrap the collection and dictionary to create an enumerable dictionary as outlined to get newenum to work properly in vba the class module has to be exported and manually edited as follows and then property get as set newenum somekeys as somecols as function as key as as property get as count property get as as set item sub as property get as set newenum property get as keys sub set somekeys new set somecols new	
simple likely there is little or no but yes indeed the way you write a query can have a huge impact on sql server issues are very database a correlated subquery will usually have poor performance compared to doing the same thing in a join to a derived things in a query that can affect performance include using where clauses instead of selecting only the fields you need and never using select not when doing a join as at least one field is using a query instead of a avoiding using a wildcard as the first character in a a like clause and on and there are very large books that devote chapters to more efficient ways to write for those that are stage 1 predicates in db2 parlance possibly other stage 1 predicates are more efficient since parts of indexes and db2 uses those

situation is a result of msbuild not supporting setup so we are forced to use devenv to build the solution with cruise real problem was that projects in the same solution were referenced by the main application and while this was not reproducible in full setup projects it did happened repeatedly in cf setup this issue by changing the architecture of our cf solutions to have all related projects in 1 project as folders so there is only 1 exe produced and packaged with the setup notable that we had missing assemblies when referencing other dll files but only when we were referencing library projects which existed in the same googling about this subject i found out some disturbing details about this which point me to the fact that this bug and the incapability of msbuild to support setup project exist since in msdn forum reports and not

standard know this thingy used by but it says the type should have the natural size for a execution but even for 64 bit int is usually only 32 so in standard terms has pretty much no common meaning for the common english of size is the size of a depends on what character you talk character types are unsigned char and signed also is used to store characters that can have any size by the implementation but must use one of the integer types as its underlying much like while char or unsigned char has to have one that means that one byte has as much bits as one char if an implementation says one object of type char has 16 then a byte has 16 bits a byte is the size that one char a not some specific there is not much more about just that it is the unit that you can access you do not have pointer access to but you have access to units starting at one now is pretty what do you all of long and their unsinged counterparts are their range is what i would call and it is documented in the c standard taken over by the for signed char the range is from for short and int it is the same and is and for long it is their unsigned counterparts range from 0 up to and those are however minimal that an int may not have maximal size on any because that is less than of it follows for those values that a minimum of bits is for char that is for that is 16 and for long that is representation for negative numbers is not which is why the negative value is not instead of for example for signed

suggest an experiment write a small program which keeps allocating memory without freeing it and then prints a small message when allocation what effects do you notice on your system when you run this does the message ever get the system behaves normally and remains responsive up to the point when the error is then i would say it is worth checking if the becomes unresponsive and eventaually unusable before the message is displayed it ever then i i would say it is not worth checking before running this save all important do not run it on a production the linux oom behaviur this is actually desirable and is the way that most oss important to realise that when you some memory you are not getting it directly from the you are getting it from the c runtime this will typically have asked the os for a big chunk of memory up front at the first which it then manages via the as many programs never use dynamiic memory at it would be undesirable for the os to hand memory to the c runtime instead it hands som euncomitted vm which will actually be comitted as you make your malloc

suggest two methods of doing overlapped and ignore the third misunderstanding your you issue an overlapped a for you can specify an overlapped structure which contains an event and you can wait for that event to be signalled to indicate the overlapped has i is your approach as previously this scale well as limited to the number of handles that you can pass to you can pass a completion routine which is called when completion this is known as and requires that the thread that issued the call is in an state for the completion routine to be threads can put themselves in an alertable state in several ways or the various ex versions of the wait the that i have open in front of me says have worked with alertable quite a and be the first to tell you that alertable is horrible and should be enough said a third before issuing the call you should associate the handle that you want to do overlapped on with a completion you then create a pool of threads which service this completion port by calling and you issue your with an overlapped structure without an event in it and when the completes the completion pops out of on one of your pool threads and can be handled previously 2008 have cleaned up how iocps work a little and removed the problem whereby you had to make sure that the thread that issued the overlapped request continued to run until the request link to a reference to that can be found but this problem is easy to work around you simply marshal the wsarecv over to one of your pool threads using the same iocp that you use for imho using iocps is the best way to do overlapped getting your head around the nature of the calls can take a little time at the start but well worth it as the system scales very well and offers a simple and method of dealing with overlapped you need some sample code to get you going then i have several articles on writing io completion port systems and a heap of free code that provides a framework for high performance see an you really should read via by jeffrey richter and christophe nasarre as it deals will all you need to know about overlapped and most other advanced windows platform techniques and

tag in the software context typically means a meaningful name or attribute being assigned to that in version control scenarios a tag is a meaningful name given to a particular state of the files represented by that for example the tag 20090401 might be assigned to the source code as it looked on april tagging something can also mean describing it or categorizing for example software such as or firefox might all be tagged to categorize them on a download allowing users to create tags and use existing tags is a powerful method to categorize content and help people zero in on items of a tag is simply an extra tidbit of information a person can gain insight into data tagging is useful for many reasons in software for example in my git repository i have a habit of creating tags based on date which can easily be ordered and parsed by a i can also give changes a more human consumable name such as the tag or or this allows for an understanding while also allowing for machine

tells an application to the other signals tell the application other things which are unrelated to shutdown but may sometimes have the same use if you want an application to shut tell it give it misleading so many seem to think more than one signal is necessary to convey that message is beyond if sigterm terminate it because the application has chosen to handle the which means it has a very good reason to not terminate got cleanup to if you allow it to finish no telling how it will behave the next time you start it or how much of its persistent data just more information on what the real meaning of the signals see and confuse with they are not the same only typical for authors of bad scripts to send and bad scripts are send if the application handles the it can take it a second to it can take a can take an depending on what the application has to get done before ready to any logic that an cleanup sequence has taken long enough and needs to be shortcut or sigkilled after x seconds is plain only reason why an application would a sigkill to is if something was so horribly wrong that something bugged out during its cleanup sequence or in which case you can open a terminal and sigkill it aside from which you really should never ever encounter unless the one developing the the only one other reason why sigkill something is because you want to prevent it from cleaning itself in which case you also want the sigterm first and after a timeout not because half the world uses sigkill after 5 seconds that not horribly

the method syntax is like this for a couple of one of these is so that it is clear what the parameters you are specifying for if you are adding an object to an at a certain you would do it using the method is called and it is clear that an object is being inserted at a specified adding a string at index 5 of an called would be called as index also reduces ambiguity between the order of the method ensuring that you pass the object parameter the index this becomes more useful when using functions that take a large number of and reduces error in passing the the method naming convention is such because support if you want to write a method that does the same but takes different this can be for the this has several object creation a language such as you would simply overload the number method to allow different data types to be passed as the in this syntax allows several different variants of the same function to be by changing the name of the method for each variant of the

theory xml would be quick good because of validation and what in practice you client side validate against a dtd or schema reasonable in most cases at try it also suffers from its verbosity and consumption unless you plan on using xslt or something and directly consuming the received packet you have to chop the data up with the dom like xml cannot reasonable looked at until it is complete at so you cannot do partial though to be fair json will have challenges there as well depending on how it is the environment of consumption json has the obvious leg there is a massive discussion of this choice plus other things like base64 encoded html in chapter 4 of the complete reference which is just on data examples prove disprove ease of handling particularly in the lesser known if i had to pick one json would be it but frankly for some uses of ajax small html fragments it is slap and is the way to do

there then simply include the referrer as one of the that you capture and send back with the redirection the referrer probably available on the client so it will work like sends initial presumably including a dynamically generates the including the referrer in a javascript collects client including the referrer value stored in step sends collected attributes to server with new redirection records referrer parameter although not in the http logs since the referer header have the same value as what the javascript request you realize none of this is reliable anyway because it all depends on the client including the referer header in step and no guarantee that will or if it does that the value you get is i also question the wisdom of doing checks of something as arbitrary as window to determine the validity of a navigation	
there to be overloaded if you feel the for all predefined types essentially a practical uses of a unary arithmetic operator are pretty and tend to relate to the consequences of using a value in an arithmetic rather than the operator for it can be used to force widening from smaller integral types to or ensure that an result is treated as an rvalue and therefore not compatible with a reference i that these uses are better suited to code golf than

think you are going to have to do quite a bit of work for you would have to create an implementation of icustomtypedescriptor which would base its implementation on whatever typedescriptor you would normally get for that in the implementations of the methods which expose the descriptors of the members you want to lock you would provide subclasses which derive from those descriptors and override the appropriate methods to wrap a lock for a you would implement getproperties to return your specific subclasses of these subclasses would override the getvalue and setvalue methods and use a lock when accessing those should be mentioned that locking like this in the ui thread is probably a bad since you want to arbitrarily block operations on that it might be better to just create a clone of the object and then have a method which updates the store of objects when you are	
think you are looking directly at module when you jit it show up under your dll it shows up in memory the runtime the module pages you are looking at are mostly metadata and which is why they are still an i wrote a small program that generates 30k static methods and calls on my the jit version of this program has mb of private comitted while the ngen version has within your module ngen does help with memory when the runtime is able to load an ngen it have to read the metadata of your module in order to jit the the jit version of my test application is using of working the ngen version is using 32 should also help your startup impact to warm startup time can be but the impact to cold startup time reading all those pages off the can be	
think you can say that an appropriate number is no or good rule of thumb for constructors is to pass an object its not its those parameters you pass in are ones that are essential for the existence of the and without which most operations of the object may not be you genuinely have a class with a very complicated natural hence requiring many parameters then consider the design of your example of a bad constructor int int the nightwatchman is being constructed with some default values that will almost certainly change in a short it seems funny that the object is told about their values one and then has them in a different way their in example of a better constructor boolean gate the watchman is watching is required information for one to in the class i would mark it chosen to pass the variable into the because here it was important that at all times the object knew whether to shoot identity is being used as could have a class called and the parameter is interpreted as part of the objects

this is a pointer and not a thus you need the operator that is roughly not exactly the same differ in that you can overload operator or operator in a class and can have different as a matter of if a class overrides and the returned value is not a raw the compiler will keep on applying to the returned object until it reaches a native operator cannot be the constructor you the use of this is completely optional as there is no name collision the code could just have named the attributes without further string string string secret server a better solution would be using an initialization if you are interested in learning google for

this originally started as a question about 404 but now a question why the patch that i applied would make a do you get a cached action to return a 404 on all requests that raise an not just the first if you start an empty rails add a product model and setup your setup your cache backend in rake then start in production and hit the site for a productcontroller def render first time the page is it returns the 404 page as every subsequent hit to that url returns a blank page with 200 how do you get it to return 404 every are the curl followed by the curl 404 not 20 apr 2009 curl 200 20 apr 2009 second response is clearly is a copy of the log for the 2 at find product with at chain halted as chain halted as in 12ms 200 ok if you pull the cached action out of the it has some sort of empty garbage in am i doing wrong confirmed that rails and exhibit this but the older versions store an empty response into the cache and they indeed throw a 404 for the subsequent having trouble testing against edge because loading it causes the following error when starting the uninitialized constant tested against the current head of the and it too exhibits this attempted to track down when the change occurred in the rails codebase to determine if it was it seems that seemingly innocuous is where the bug are the details of the where 404 denotes the desired 200 being 375e8976e3 b1c989f28d beca1f2e15 f1fff0a48 f1e20ce9a7 a5004573d8 2e1132fad8 200 the difference seems to start at this c69d8c043f d961592886 276ec16007 0efec6452 13c6c3cfc5 fb2325e35 3cb89257b4 is a patch that reverses the which when applied to tag fixes the am not smart enough to fathom why this seemingly small change would actually make a someone smarter than me could shed some light on the module actioncontroller do include include include include include patch seems to also fix the related showcased where the in xyms 404 not found did not show up in the above patch broke other things in so i delved in and generated a fix for the issue that cause collateral the patch and any subsequent updates will be at rails is the difference between include and include

to question it seems that this is not because they cannot be declared uninitialized to question my bar1 is instantiated with the constructor what i causes a compiler error you use uninitialized initialize references of your class in your initializer bar bar bar to question the particular scenario on right i want to normal variables the term for them by the is no correct name for typically you can just say pointers for most discussions this and everything you need to discuss will also apply to you initialize non non reference members in the same way via the initailizer int to question can be declared the is it best practice set this to can be declared uninitialized it is better to initialize them to null because then you can check if they are in something with to question looks like i have to use in this is this the best way of using can use either pointers or but references cannot be and references cannot be a pointer is just like any other like an but it holds a memory an array is an aliased name for another pointer has its own memory whereas an array should be seen as sharing the address of the variable it a after it is initialized and you use it just like you would have used the variable it there is no special a to access the value at the address it you have to the you do this by putting a before holds the address of is a reference to this point r x to x to until now holds the address of y to question about smart this pointers are used so that when you allocate on the you do not need to manually free your none of the examples i gave above allocated on the here is an example where the use of smart pointers would have foo new memory for p is never freed but if you would have used a smart pointer then it would have been freed to question attempting to implement reference variable field in my and initializing it in why might i receive following problem is that you specify an initializer see my answer to question 2 everything after the colon

to the choice is obviously tfs integration into visual studio is incomplete to say the least lot of features available from the and a bit buggy certainly while tfs one is perfect makes had my whole workspace corrupted several times using svn one never using tfs 2 related features of both systems are probably quite they are accessible directly from the ide with while you have to rely on or other external tools if you use all tfs tasks are accessible in a few clicks on the solution explorer is a lot easier with even for complex merges will add and to your so need to manually edit them to open them again from i think those reasons are more than enough to prefer tfs over i mus add that is more than just a tool work project used it on a project 3 3 business in the and been able to successfully centralize all the tasks in tfs project build not saying not possible to do the same using svn and other but definitely nice to have all things nicely integrated in one stay here are the two obvious drawbacks of tfs tfs is quite a while svn installation is a matter of tfs 2008 over sqlserver 2008 is quite you cannot install tfs on a to definetely the worst installation experience ever had with a microsoft being once tfs is very easy to use for coders not familiar with source control my current i started with and quickly switched to happy i main reason why decided to switch is clearly the overall buggy behaviour of svn was using as a server and as a at least once a i found myself spending hours on cryptical ankhsvn error i found a single reason to regret the switch to

we look at enterprise application design then the methods for fetching users getuserbyid and getallusers would be in separate class you can name it userdata or userdao data access you should design an interface for userdao with appropriate methods for handling user objects such as getuserxxx and so should be an implementation of userdao as per the data for example if your users are stored in database then you can implement the logic of accessing database in the implementation of are the advantages of keeping the access methods in separate user object should be plain object with just getter setter this would facilitate passing object across tiers from data access to business tier to web this would also help keep user object the data access logic is loosely coupled from the user object that means if the datasource then you need not change the user object this also assists in test driven development where you might need to have mock objects during testing if user object is complex object with relations with other objects such as address or department or role then the complexity of relationships will be encapsulated in userdao rather than leaking in the user porting to frameworks like nhibernate or or linq would become easier if the patterns are	
web application is not suited at all to be running something at a fixed if there are no requests coming there is no code running in the and if the application is inactive for a while the iis can decide to shut it down completely until the next request comes some applications it at all important that something is run at a specific only that it has been run if that is the case for your application then you could just keep track of when the table was last and for every request check if enough time has passed for the table to be polled you have access to administer the there is a scheduler in sql it can run stored and even start processes if you have permission is very unlikely on a shared you need the code on a specific and you access the server to schedule it or run it as a or use the sql server simply not

what doing is really high volume then what looking for is something like it is a distributed work queue you just put a job on the queue and then forget about course then you need something at the other end reading the queue and processing the there are multiple ways of doing easiest is probably to have a cron job that runs sufficiently often to read the work queue and process the alternatively you can use some kind of persistent daemon process that is woken up by work becoming advantage of this kind of approach is you can tailor the number of workers to how much work needs to get done and beanstalkd handles distributed prorcessing the sense that the listners can be on different

working on near the exact same partitioning is definitely the way to go i would segment by more than year it would give you a greater degree of just set up your partitions and then constrain them by months some other in your need to turn to really get the the additional benefit here is that you can only index the exact tables you really want to pull information if batch importing large amounts of data into this you may get slightly better results a rule vs a trigger and for i find rules easier to but for smaller triggers are much the postgresql manual has a great section on partitioning via

would agree that individual tables is it is more scalable and better for query if in future the users want more columns on a particular lookup then you can add the application will have to create tables and constraints i normally do but then this application is already altering existing tables and adding columns to which i normally do	
would agree with but as you commented on my answer if you have no grouping column and several entries in your table it will be difficult to find a matching you have only one ip entry 4 then you the lineid in to the 4 lines the first solution can be used to parse several ip but it needs sequential inserts in the	
would agree with your initial idea on this one however it does depend on the create the base rule and add to the stylesheet with exceptions to that example if you are sure that a table within a table will definately never need the same style applied to it then use the selector to set the if however that may only occur once then set a class on the parent table and amend your selector to be something along the lines of should be changed to a descriptive name for the like calendar as that is what it you should not name a class after a particular style because if the style changes it makes no sense any

would thank my lucky stars that sql server have oracle packages we need a way to take all these procedures and put them in one i make developers create and maintain two files for each they will love us long as ms never implements packages like oracle be a win in my for packages are simply a way to organize your stored procedures packages so that you have 100 stored procedures sitting but maybe 5 not stackable like packages in java or all packages are at the same package requires two the headers file and the body this creates frustration when adding new procedures to an existing because you cannot add the body without adding the even though it contains the exact same information as is in the here is a snippet from the header file of one of my procedure in out the corresponding procedure in the procedure in out the header file is useless and is simply another hurdle for the developer to step over when developing with on my we have a convention that all the commented documentation for each procedure goes in the along with the details of when it was added and by but that could just as easily be included in the

would you handle i have taken ownership of an existing app and database that was written in the database design is fairly meaning the main tables are fairly wide and developers have continued to tack on additional columns to the end of the this has resulted in columns that have a lot of nulls since they directly relate to the primary am considering splitting the main table out as a way to abstract myself from the years and years of i am certain that new fields will continue to be added as new requirements come the question as new fields are do you continue to grow the width of the existing or do you stop extending an existing table and split it out into a separate supporting table that will house new thereby creating a if you were to split the main what would your assume for this example i have a table called with 150 is a good name for the new the there are views and stored procs that will need to be modified to support any new but that is inevitable anyway when columns are in advance for any to handle column growth of flat

you have a very straight forward method signatures methods that takes and returns primitive types such as it is reasonably easy to do so in and still possible but a bit harder in java with if your class methods uses modern programming techniques such as boost shared pointers and stl containers then it is a very different you will need to be really careful with memory management in this is gonna be even more interesting if the method has template arguments because template system is very different from or java generics in that it is only a compile time basically this means the signature of the method or class is different every time you pass a different data type to the template this made the method impossible to wrap in or	
you have any recommendations of books or websites that would teach me mathematical as a developer i work on a wide range of projects from server stuff through to flash games and i often find myself referring to articles on the internet for many of the articles contain mathematical and unless they are accompanied by explanations i usually struggle to convert the formula into have a degree in interactive and so i have had no formal higher math i find math to be too taxing to figure by learning this notation i will be able to further my knowledge by actually being able to get stuck into more of suggest i go back to school and do a higher math course while i know this would be the best it simply an other than any and all suggesstions are are a few types of thing that i program most not sure what areas of math these and 3d collision utilities for data collection applications and 3d vector mainly based around manipulation fading from one colour to the adding and subtracting making colours lighter darker on the this helps add a bit of to learn mathematical

you override you basically become responsible for making sure that your nested controls get created approach seems pretty for your simple i do not think you need to be calling if you picked this up from the msdn docs on the take another look the property example that they give is retrieving the text value from one of its child which means that the property accessor needs to make sure the child controls cannot guarantee when someone might access your which is why you would put in calls before any access to a control in your controls in a normal page will get called when gets around to adding your composite control to the this may not happen until prerender on the first page load if nobody touches your control and it databind or subsequent createchildcontrols will be called during viewstate or any code might touch off a composite control to start creating child will do it for example and this could happen in that i think on the right

you should be using webdeployment projects as this will do a lot more compilation and checking of your code and see for more have 4 environments setup dv py pp pd all matching branches in each of these has also has an entry in the sln configuration manager where you can setup what projects are required to be build and the build that is setup correctly you can then start setting up deployment i prefer use msbuild to deploy as it will give you a lot more approach to msbuild is a bit strange to start with however once you get the hang of it quite deployment script which is added to the teambuild config is basically as you can see i do a bit of cleanup before i copy to the live i also use 2 msbuild frameworks at the tasks release tasks suite release to files in to to files that were removed were you will need to modify to your system also it clears down the target folder before it starts to copy the new build this is to make sure they system is clean but obviously you will need to add anything that you need to keep to the excludedfiles also have a folder for each environment in the main application this holds the replacements feature of webdeployment and any other environement specifc will be a long process to get it working correctly but hopefully this will get you if you choose this

you that the threads stuck in read calls are the same threads that were sending the data is it possible that the threads actually involved are instead blocked on some other and your stackdump shows other innocent threads that just happen to be doing socket been a while since i worked with but i vaguely remember the jvm using sockets for would examine all the receiving side to see if one of them is the intended receiver and is instead doing something else for 15 fact that it works in one location vs another usually points to an application timing not a datacenter

you touch a member in your class from the you need to provide a that the compiler creates the function in the dll itself and makes it the compiler know which methods are used by the clients of a class it must enforce that all methods are must enforce that all members which can be accessed by clients must their functions this happens when the compiler is warning you of methods not exported and the linker of the client sending every member must be marked with with private members not touchable by here you can the warnings of compiler generated the members must export their declaring them with does not export the methods of these you have to mark the according classes in their as it boils down to not you have members which be used by switch off the you have members which must be used by create a wrapper or create indirection cut down the count of externally visible members use methods like class does create an instantiation of the template specialization in the current compilation so this creates the methods of in the dll and exports the corresponding this does not work for concrete classes as this is only an instantiation of template

you were pretty try t foobar2 public return foobar1 foobar2 fb2 issue you were having is that you were specifying the return type of as you should have it as just you want to do specific things for you can specialize the on return sounds like you are having issues with the compiler not finding the definition for your templated templates in are rather and the usual practice is to put the entire template implementation in a header you might try imagematrix public various functions t create a new instance of imagematrix and return find the gcc but on explicit template instantiation and it gives a bit of an idea of likely want to either include the implementation in the header as i suggested or call getrotatedcopy in the or else instantiate it explicitly in the see below for the reason this works differently from is that templates in unlike actually create a whole new for each different combination of template is a completely different class a different set of compiled than see for a better to the error going away when you use the that actually tell you since until you actually instantiate a not going to update going to you can only use it if the pointer is actually pointing to an instance of the class you are casting works similar to the operator in suspect that what you are wanting is the you start out with an instance of and want to use a base class method on and get back a new copy of try something along these t return imagefilter public imagefilter imagefilter otherfilter if you really do want to start out with an imagematrix and transform it into an have to add a constructor on imagefilter that takes an
