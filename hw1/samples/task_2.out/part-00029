101 info on casting is is you can use the keyword which tries to cast the object and if it instead of throwing return note that the target type must be a reference type in the prod setting as should always use the above code instead of the equivalent exception an by type jon skeet pointed you should use extension method to filter a sequence easily you got filteredsequence an to type you want to try casting each element to the target type opposed to filtering by you can use the extension castedsequence

absolutely this can be accomplished and the reason and purpose of the print media in mind that stylesheets are cumulative so if you want to incorporate all your styling from your normal screen stylesheet then you need to include to your link means that css rules in the screen stylesheet will compete with your print stylesheet rules in terms of if your screen stylesheet declares a your print stylesheet must exceed that specificity in its rules or match them and appear a lesser specific rule override that screen if you specify the table width in the html eg then lost the battle because virtually no way for a stylesheet rule to override what amounts to an inline css you must declare the width in your screen then override it in your print

agree with jeremy what describing need the complexity of callback the worker nodes could simply expose a wcf service even a wsdl or rest web service for that and then the controller would simply need to know the urls of each of the child nodes and send messages to the worker you want the controller to be able to broadcast a single message and have all of the worker really dislike the i long ago switched to calling it nodes do something in response and post their progress back to the then you might want to use the often underrated p2p channel available within this allows a group of services written in wcf to talk to each other all at once as peers with urls being used almost like for you might issue commands on the only the controller sends commands on that channel but all of the worker nodes when done doing their thing they can report progress back on the an added benefit of this approach is that you need this the individual workers would gain the ability to know what all the other workers are in however that if you use p2p then have to deal with contention you may end up with 2 nodes accepting the same if this is then p2p is your if you need commands to be issued and only picked up serially by individual nodes as they become free more likely scenario when telling remote nodes to run individual test then you can use a msmq binding instead of then all of the workers become clients which receive messages from the queue and you can more easily counteract the situation of multiple workers accepting the same additional blog post i wrote a while back on the peer channel scenarios on this is good because you can go from here to peer channel concepts to the reference channel team

all likelihood going to have to take the eav approach described in another and create a data you would then not only be storing the specific data for an but you would also have a table structure for storing data that defines the data in an exam relationships between basically using the relational aspect of your rdbms to create your own relationship sounds it to an though not as much as it might worth it in the long run if you intend for this medical system to be scalable and not store multiple values in one for any a quick exam patient miscellaneous scalar data thats with an exam value exam value is your basic structure for storing exam then you value group group value group value sort very basic and but it hopefully gives you a glimpse into what talking you may want to take it a step further and define specific exam types that have particular then assign an exam type to an but leave that up to

am attempting to write expand on an graph search algorithm that will let me find the path to get closest to destination node considering there is no guarantee that the nodes will be provide a realistic application of say i need to get from ontario to i know my possible options at my start point are local go bus or i know that walking is the least desired way to get to my destination so i look at go bus i know i can take go to a point close to but at that point the go bus turns and goes another direction at that closest point is at a place where i have no options than but the algorithm would only consider walking for short distances otherwise it will consider the route not this same if the algorithm were to find that i can get there a way that is longer but gets me closer to the destination node possible at the destination that would be a higher weighted path weightings matter so much while its only when the results are it would list by which path was closest to the destination in ascending for one go bus may get me 3km from the destination while 3 public transit buses would get me 500m my question is two what algorithm should i start with that does something how would i programmaticly explain that ok if nodes connect so that it just jump from node a to node would starting from the end and working backward accomplish i forgot to ask how to aim for the best approximate solution because especially with a large graph there will be possibly millions of solutions for this to design an approximate path

am not well acquainted to the compiler the act of transforming code the not readable assembly into machine code for rocket science combined with will narrow down the subject of this question to win32 executables when i open these files up in a specialised i can find strings 16b per scattered at various but the rest is just i suppose the unreadable part is the machine code maybe such as images there any straightforward way of reading the machine opening the exe as a file stream and reading it byte by how could one turn these individual bytes into is there a straightforward mapping between these and the assembly is the four bytes per i have noticed some applications can create executable files just like for in acd see you can export a series of images into a but this does not necessarily have to be a swf acd see is also capable of producing executable how is that can i understand what goes on inside an exe machine

animation would be a great technology for a but if you want to stick with nsview for the time being you could create a class similar to nscell that the gameboard view uses to implement positioning and this would work in a similar way as many cocoa control which use a single cell different to draw multiple items inside a in mind that using individual nsview objects may very well be more than fast but regardless of any speed differences this strategy allows you to separate the logic in a way that makes

answer is but let me offer the perspective of someone who is using have sort of been the whipping boy of the rails community for a everyone understands the drawbacks of but no one is really championing their in my factories by themselves can easily become just as difficult to maintain as fixtures really depends on the but i the real strength of factories is in selective replacement of talk about a couple first issue is if you can test most of your app without hitting the database then you will see a significant speed but for most applications i think wise to test without hitting the database at some point you want to test the whole every time you mock or stub you are making an assumption about an interface that may contain subtle assuming that you need to hit the database on some significant percentage of transactional fixtures using transactional fixtures could well be much much faster than instantiating a whole environment for every with the size of your test suite that you really need to look towards to scale your development to the next no matter how much you speed them still a long time for developers to maybe look at as well to help at the individual but ultimately ci is going to allow you to maintain testing discipline without sacrificing developer place where fixtures really shine is in the way i look at it is that the fixtures should set up a healthy base state for the app to be most unit tests really need you can get very good unit coverage using however when it comes to functional any given page may be hitting dozens of i want to set up all that stuff in each as i construct ever more complex getting closer and closer to recreating a global data state which is what fixtures were designed to do in the first controversial belief i hold is that all else being i prefer one functional test to 20 unit tests rails because the functional test proves that the end result that is sent to the user is the unit tests are great for getting at nuances of but at the end of the you could still have a bug along an interface that breaks your entire functional tests are what give me the confidence hitting deploy without actually loading up the page in my i know that i could stub everything out and test both interfaces and get the same but if i can test the whole stack in one simple test at the expense of a little much rather do what are my best practices for up a handful for every model to cover the broadest categories of adding a major new feature that cuts across many models and add some new fixtures to represent the major editing old fixtures except for factories for more localized factories for testing pagination or other mass creation that is only needed for a few let me recommend for really good pragmatic testing the thing i like most about blog is that he always acknowledges that testing is very and what works for one project does not necessarily work for

answer is it depends on what your application whether it accesses memory a lot or kevin is the processor does have to do address translation a but this probably hurt the performance of your application too the underlying hardware instructions are mostly the same between x86 and amd64 and there is not too much inefficiency there assuming the clr authors knew what they were doing sure they you might see a big performance difference if doing graphics but since this is just a i think you for some number crunching tasks you might notice a difference as mehrdad though be surprised if you i would say not to worry about the performance issues unless you have a then only worry about performance issues once you understand the nature of your

answers are missing something read someone please tell me how print out a variable in my seems like an easy thing to do but i just seem do xslt there are two main ways of producing the contents of an depending on whether it contains a scalar value number or or has a structured value a or more nodes from xml use this to produce a scalar actually produces a text containing this scalar use this to produce a copy of all nodes contained in the is very important to that if an contains a list of nodes and the instruction is only the string value of the first node will be this is a frequently committed error and a is a third if the should be used in producing an xpath expression in the curly braces is evaluated and the result is put into the attribute xslt the instruction when run not in compatibility produces a list of text nodes one for each node contained in the when run in compatibility mode the attribute the instruction behaves in the same way as it does in xslt xslt behaves in the same way as in xslt however it is recommended to use the new because the former produces a new copy of every while does not produce new copies of

apps or tools do you use for data entry into your trying to improve our existing system that uses a php web based system for entering data one item at a current solution to this is to use a it works well with text and numbers that are human but not with foreign keys that are used to join with the other that i want a row of data to include what city someone lives the column holding this is which is keyed to the table which has two id and name envision being able to extend the spreadsheet capabilities to include dropdown for every row of the column that would allow the user to select which city the text of the city but actually storing the city id this the spreadsheet show a great deal of data on each screen and could be exported as a csv file and thrown to our existing scripts that manually insert rows into the have been playing around with ms excel and as well as but have not found something that gives me the functionality i mention items on my dynamically fetch the name of cities that can be selected by the allow the user to push the data directly into the backend via external if any of the columns of the rows of data gets changed in the the user could refresh the data on the screen to reflect any recent you know how i could improve the process of data what tools do you i use postgresql for the backend and have access to ms as well as web based i would love a solution that is and require much time to develop or deploy dream know that pgadmin3 has similar but from what i have it is more of an administrative tool rather than something for users to applications do you use for data entry and retrieval via

are working on a similar implementation to what you are describing as a proof of what we see as an for us consists of three separate servers to accomplish is a that is responsible for generating the indices that will be there is a service implementation that handles the workflows used to build these as well as being able to signal completion custom management api exposed via wcf web are two access to the api is provided via wcf services to the they sit behind a physical load balancer and will periodically the publication server to see if there is a more current set of indicies than what is currently if it it requests a lock from the publication server and updates the local indices by initiating a transfer to a local once it is just a matter of suspending the searcher while the index is it then releases its lock and the other server is available to do the i we are only approaching the proof of concept stage with as a replacement for our current which is a load balanced endeca the size of the indices and the amount of time it will take to actually complete the tasks required are the larger questions that have yet to be proved some random things that we are downtime of a given server could be reduced if two local folders are used on each machine receiving data to achieve a are looking to see if the load balancer allows programmatic access to have a node remove and add itself from the this would lessen the chance that a user experiences a hang if accesses during an are looking at in the event that cluster manipulation is not looked at while a lot of it just works out of the we have some bench time to explore this path as a learning exercise learning things like improving our wf and wcf and implementing mvc for a management worst case we go with something like but have gained experience in some skills we are looking to improve

assigning a default to a field false to a fxcop initializes field of type to remove this initialization because it will be done automatically by the i know that code as a or ok is introducing some but to me it seems a very good one that my teachers insisted on righteously in my only is the performance penalty very more relying on the default is relying on the knowledge of each programmer ever to use a piece of on every datatype that comes with a i think this is very the very program that should protect you from making all too obvious is suggesting here to make only for some increased talking about only executed programmers who care that can of course omit the initialization should probably use c or assembler fxcop making an obvious mistake or is there more to updates is not just my but what i have been taught at not that i like to use ad just to show that it just and concerning i just found this i initialize object fields to default does fxcop think initializing fields to the default value is	
assume you want to scroll it horizontally otherwise it could be confusing with static could put the auto onto a containing element of the inner table cells not sure how browsers would handle but you may be able to put the elements you want fixed inside thead and tfoot and put the scrolling portion inside a tbody and set overflow to you may need to drop semantics and code the left column and right column outside the try code it as semantic as and then use javascript to position the left and right without you should make it fail gracefully to just a wide table sure how difficult this would as you say you have a fixed could try this jquery example to put the first values nametable start making a table for name column tbody iterate through existing var namecol get column of index var cellheight get the height of this equalise the height across the row so removing this element will not collapse the height if it is taller than the scores and total nametable cellheight append the next row with new height and remove this cell from the table now been placed finish table insert just before the score css to position them to align this is but it should give you some

best i can think of with is the this tells to run as many jobs as possible in you want to limit the number of concurrent jobs to you can sure the dependencies are correct so run jobs it have thing to take into account is optimizations that does with the you can specify various levels of the higher the the longer the compile and link a project i work with runs takes 2 minutes to link with and half a minute with you should make sure not optimizing more than you need you could build without optimization for development builds and with optimization for deployment with debug info will probably increase the size of your executable and may impact your build if you need try removing it to see if it affects type of linking should make a as far as i understand static linking takes longer i may be wrong you should see if this affects your

better or the answer is when the framework came out and tableadapters were included in the it became ridiculously easy to get your basic crud type or even a front page showing simply connect to your drag your and the structure was in including key need to perform updates on this use the specify your existing or let the wizard generate the procedures for hook that up to a gridview and you can quickly do lots of edit multiple records while and update in single or this kind of convenience is hard to pass up when working on projects that want to get done plus having things in this native format become convenient for xml shenanigans if that is what you need since the dataset model uses xml under the hood for a lot of will admit that i have not checked out the latest versions of the orms out and not sure if there is a wizard for linq that will do this much within a few and most people are a little slow to adapt newer technology as so it easy to see how it is still being used that new dynamic data service is built off of linq to sql or linq to i think the tide might finally change to the newer

both because a second thread will also get the lock in that but that case happen if all threads follow the spinlock the lock is available has the value when taken by some it has the value no other values are one thread that wants the whether or not it is signaled at the moment that thread called is it is allowed to take the lock if is and it takes by changing it to the first iteration where that happens causes the loop to exit and the thread to have the consider two threads that want the same both are calling waiting to see the value 1 become because the function is only one of the waiting threads ever gets to see the value all the other threads only ever see as and must continue to condition where is 1 after setting it to 0 in this thread implies that some other thread signaled between the atomic operation and the since only one thread at a time is supposed to have the seems like it that guessing that this is an attempt to satisfy the invariant promise of the no longer so more if it is the value of must be if it is if setting it to zero then something weird is and it is best not to assume it is now held by this thread when the invariant is not jon skeet points out that this case might be a flaw in the original i suspect race condition that is being guarded is against a thread that have the right to signal the signaling the spinlock if you trust callers to follow the spinlocks probably the synchronization method of after the proposed revision looks much it would clearly avoid the cache coherency interaction that the original had due to always writing the sentinel reading about the can learn something new every if you pay and the multicore cache coherency issue it is it is clear to me that the original code was trying to do something but without understanding the subtlety behind it would indeed have been safe all callers follow the to drop the redundant check on as it was but the code would have been writing to on every loop and that would have played havoc in a real multicore chip with caching per new spinlock is still vulnerable to a second thread releasing it without holding there is no way to repair my earlier claim about trusting the callers to follow protocol still

bytes since a method is not included in the unless you are also talking about the type of in which case probably 160 on the 160 the 160 would be if each object allocated its own vtable is one possible alternatively as is pointed out in the a better way would be one vtable per which would mean 80 the size of the pointer to the vtable 4 or 8 bytes depending on the so 84 or 88 whole thing totally depends on the way the vm allocates memory and deals with without knowing how the particular vm is implemented neither question can be answered

can only tell if a tcp socket is by attempting to send this is because the design of the protocol is such that supposed to allow for temporary outages between if you connect from a via r1 via r2 via r3 to b and send data for a while and then stop sending you could unplug and neither a nor b would notice if you then plugged and and then tried to send data between a and b then things would and never you tried to send data when was disconnected then after all the tcp level get an error some operating systems may be able to alert you to the fact that your local network adapter currently connected and you could use that to say no longer connected to my but i advise having your peers know when connections are is important then either use an application level message to occasionally send data between the peers or use tcp personally go for the ping of course all that is assuming that you want to know if you can still send data on a after told when the client is no longer sending because your reads will return 0 bytes and you know when it disconnects its send side because your writes will you also know when you shutdown either the send or recv side of your own end of the guess i should have stuck with initial gut reaction response of

choose whether to use an sql database based on how much data i wanted to store i would choose based on of data i wanted to store and how it is to be defines a database database is a structured collection of records or data that is stored in a computer and i think your answer lies if you want to store records such as customer access rights and so on then a db such as mysql or sqlite or whatever is not they give you a tried and trusted mechanism for managing those on the other your website stores and delivers unchanging content such as mp3s and so on then simply storing them in a directory layout on a disk is more than i would also include xml documents if you had for example a production department that created articles for a website in xml format there is no need to put them in a db store them on disk and use xslt to deliver choice of sql or not will also depend on how the content you wish to store is to be sql is obviously good for retrieving many records based on search criteria whereas a directory xml rdf etc are more likely to be used to retrieve single of storage mechanism is very important when trying to scale site and stuffing everything into a sql db will quickly become a

control will not rebind to the viewstate data if you set the to or an empty the article i linked below has an excellent explanation as to what is going on is once you have set the to or an empty string the control takes this as an indication from the consumer of the control that they do not wish to bind any data at all viewstate the control checks the prior to binding and if it is an empty string then it does not in its datasource datasourceid

conversion using the operator is a it will convert both to a common type and compare the way strings are converted to integers is that the you linked contradict check the second where it says that comparing the integer to a string using shall be happens is that the string is converted to and strings that do not contain or begin with a convert to vs string that consists of a or begins with a is considered a if the string has other characters after that these are a string starts with a character that cannot be interpreted as part of a then it is a and will convert to this mean that a numeric string has to start with a digit for example is a numeric string because the minus sign is part of a number in that for your string does not start with a so it would convert to but your second string would be converted to integer so why your second test does not work the same you should probably the use of triple equals instead of a double this ensures that what you are comparing is a string that contains the digit zero and prevents any type

decided that there is no guaranteed way to do the solution that i present below works for english version but fails when compiling with japanese version vc2003 perhaps it is japanese in any it cannot be depended on to note that even declaring everything as strings work is painful in gcc as described i believe that you just need to bite the bullet and move all text into a data file and load it from i am now storing and accessing the text in ini files via at least there is a guarantee that it works as all text is out of the answering this myself since only evan appeared to understand the the answers regarding what unicode is and how to use are not relevant for this problem as this is not about nor a misunderstanding of character i appreciate your attempt to help apologies if i clear problem is that i have source files that need to be under a variety of platforms and the program does it care about any other i want to have string literals in like currently works with gcc and how do i do it with backward compatible is what i have literals are used as is encoded source files must not have a literals are used as is encoded source files may or may not have a bom literals are massaged by the compiler raw string literals are to a specified is not supported as a target files must have a the simple answer is that for this particular is broken and does not supply a backward compatible compile the only way to get unicode strings into the compiled program is via bom wchar which means that i need to convert all strings back to at time of any simple method of converting wchar to for what size and encoding is the wchar on on other it see the for some the end i decided that i will avoid the conversion cost on all compilers other than with source like the visual 2005 and later require the source files in and all strings to be encoded as otherwise the strings will be converted into the local multibyte encoding and cause to use a as these strings then need to be convert back to this function is just a rough example of how to do define char static char return visual 2003 and gcc will use the string literals as so the files should be saved as gcc requires the files to not have a define that this code is just a simplified production use would need to clean it up in a variety of ways error buffer size is used like the following it compiles cleanly and works correctly in my tests on and

developing a php mysql application that handles multiple simultaneous thinking of the best approach to take when it comes to locking warning against records that are currently being viewed scenario to avoid is two users viewing the one making a then the other doing likewise with the potential that one change might overwrite the the latest versions of wordpress they use some method to detect but it does not seem wholly reliable often returning false at least in my assume some form of ajax must be in place to the application and let it know the record is still being viewed edited a user might simply close their browser and then how would the application know solution i could see is to check the last updated time when a record is submitted for to see if in the interim it has been updated elsewhere and then offer the user a choice to proceed or discard their own barking up the wrong tree in terms of a solution what are peoples experiences of implementing this must be a fairly application record locking best

example suppose i have a class vehicle and i wish for a subclass convertiblevehicle which has extra methods such as i wish to instantiate as convertible new i still have access to common method such as how do i designed such a clarify my two initial neither of which i am happy with dummy methods which i override in convertiblevehicle leaving them to do nothing in other abstract methods and force each subclass to provide an implementation even if it will be blank in all instances other than above seem slightly convoluted since they both pollute the base class as i add an increasing number of subclasses each with their own unique reading some of the responses perhaps there is some type of fundamental flaw in my suppose i have a class vehiclefleet which takes vehicles and instructs them to drive as for i this works for dozens of subclasses of vehicle but for convertiblevehicle i also want to fold the roof before to do so i subclass vehiclefleet as for i leaves me with a messy function stuck in the base class where it really belong which is overridden only in the case of convertiblevehicle and does nothing in all the other the solution works but seems very does this problem lend itself to a better using java although i would hope that a general solution could be found that will work in any object oriented language and that i will not need to rely upon language specific do i design a sub class with features not available in the base

experienced to work with the code which was but still of low actually reviewer looked through the code and could think that this is more formal procedure and pay enough attention to the process of review and have reviewed the some small fixes can be made but significant flaws are problem is to explain that it is important to make the thorough because in future this code is easier to easy to reassign to other person all these reasons are not essential for responsible for code is another author of code can leave reviewer think about company spend more time to fix bugs when they reproduced by it mater for some things are not author explain this to the and reviewer even can support effectively such to make reviewer interested in high quality code

explanation may not be too academical but this is how i understand it go to university first step involves algebra that proved in the century that any mathematical operation can be expressed using a series of symbols and some associated thus the base 10 arithmetic with the common operators can be expressed in using just two symbols and logic operators or leading to the boolean logic that is the mathematical foundation of digital second step is work that constructed a mathematical model of an imaginary machine that could process the naive description of a turing machine would be any automaton that has memory store operates on a series of symbols that represent state and interprets another series of symbols that define the transition from one state to modern digital processor is an implementation of a turing machine that uses logical algebra as the symbol and operator base a look at a how stuff works explanation of logic at the reason for this is that the logical states can be easily mapped to electrical signals and their associated operators can be implemented in transistor circuits that given a binary input can output the result according to the boolean so any modern computer is a machine that has store state in binary and an array of circuits that accept electrical impulses and operators processor and output results accordingly at a very fast every program written in any computer language is eventually translated by the compiler or runtime into a series of boolean operations for the processor to

find that that allow the first syntax separated tend to have significant time taken up debugging cases where more rows are returned than unintentional cross joins are the bane of a and can bring even the most database to it has brought our system to a screeching halt on at least two occasions in the last second syntax forces the writer to think about how the tables are joined together and then only return the interesting it is impossible to accidentally do a cross join using this and thus the danger of accidental poorly performing queries is that issue i have never noticed any speed difference between the two syntaxes in any systems i have

guessing you know you can bind a variable to to remove that piece of dynamic unfortunately for your clause and you bind a variable for a list in oracle least up to as far as i do have a few your current solution is the another solution is to change the procedure to accept multiple variables and create a list of and from c where and and and have a fixed list of in values from c where and not in have to be careful in the case where you only want 2 the third will have to be set to some value not in be careful and test null values solution is presented in this looks quite though i tested it works by creating a function which allows you to pass a series of numbers separated by commas and creating a via dual to do a or replace type mytabletype as table of or replace function in varchar2 return long default mytabletype exit when end return example would look something from c where and not in select from inlist select as mytabletype from dual would only work if was a list of have to change str2tbl to handle quotes if they are included in the variable you cant change plus change the type of to or something more if the original sql not effecting performance then for simplicity sake leave it as dynamic much less of a head ache to otherwise test out the it should work in oracle 8 and just for i came across nice article on binding that covers the simple problems like though not using variables for in

have a nsis installer that we previously built using nant scripts that copy some files around and run via a exec task to build the installer after the nant script i have the compelte structure for our cd and also our was just doing a get from sourcesafe onto an unused desktop and using it as a build compiling sometimes we would have a couple of files checked in that fix something in those cases i would go to the build and very selectively get only those to avoid getting other changed files that we ready to release basically i am able to allow development to continue and selectively include certain changed files into the installer for we no longer have a free and need to build from our so i am setting up ci factory so that the developer can kick the build off without remoting into the the one issue i am struggling is the best way to continue to allow this selective change control to the default concept of ci that ci factory implements is fine for internal development i also want to setup a ccnet project that is run only on demand via a force build for this type of is what brain stormed so without being sure how well this will if at figuring out what ccnet and ci factory are all the ccnet project would be setup such that it would get modifications would trigger a since the other ccnet project that is using the default ci call it the of getting latest when changes are then these two projects share the same working so the would need a different working so that its files get updated when the ci build is the developer would need to remote into the one selectively do a get into the working and then force a build through ci i see with this having to remote in to selectively do i have no idea how to allow a single ci factory project to have two different working copies of the product so that each project configuration block has afraid of what kind of strangeness this might not quite sure yet how to specify a source control block in ccnet project config but prevent it from doing a get latest when it still gradually figuring out what things are in scripts and can be easily taken out without breaking other versus what is not meant to be mucked around with is not would really like to hear about how others deal with this issue of selectively releasing if you have a similar i am constrained to so my immediate need is to solve this with that in but at the same time be interested in hearing how you manage this with other source control i guess you would probably have a branch that is your latest developments and then merge changes into the trunk whenever you want to release i really trust vss for and i think the branching concepts might be a little too much overhead and learning curve for this like i said stories with other source control systems would be useful future knowledge for in integration of changes with continuous

have a set of students to as items in the title for amongst these some have a reputation for being we are told about a set of hate relationships of the form hates hates does imply hates we are supposed to arrange the students in rows most row numbered in a way such that if hates then i should be put in a row that is lesser numbered than that of j other in some row that is in front of so that i throw anything at j back is not what would be an efficient algorithm to find the minimum number of rows needed row need not have the same number of will make the following if we model this as a directed there are no cycles in the the most basic cycle would if hates is hates is because i think the ordering would become every student in the group is at least hated by one other student or at least hates one other of there would be students who are both hated by some and who in turn hate other this means that there are no stray students who form part of the i have already thought of constructing a directed graph with i j if hates j and doing topological since the general topological sort would suit better if i had to line all the students in a single since there is a variation of the rows i am trying to figure out how to factor in the change into topological sort so it gives me what i you please state the complexity of your if anybody is giving code and you mind the then prefer java but of course any other language is just as this is not for any kind of homework am not a student btw to establish ordering amongst a set of

have a similar situation to you and our solution is to use a our cms app stores the actual files in a database and notifies a publishing service when a file has been created or this publisher then notifies all the subscribing web applications and they then go and get the file from the database and place it on their file have the subscribers set in a config file on the publisher but you could go the whole hog and have the web app do the subscription itself on app startup to make it even easier to could use a unc for the we chose a db for convenience and portability between or production and test environments simply copy the db back and we have all the live site files as well as the

have an application that runs multiple threads which are sometimes these threads may call into another object that internally accesses a resources to prevent the resource to be accessed there is a critical section to get some order in the when cancelling the it happens that the thread is just within that code that is blocked by the critical the critical section is locked using an object and i was hoping that upon cancellation of the thread this object would be destructed and consequently release the however this does not seem to be the so that at thread destruction this resource object is permanently the resource object is probably not an option party plus it makes sense to prevent simultaneous access to a resource that can not be used in have experimented with preventing the thread to be cancelled using when the section is however this does feel a bit dirty and would not be a final solution for other situations aquired know that a prefered solution would be to not use but instead set a flag in the thread and it would cancel itself when it is ready a clean however as i want to cancel the thread i was wondering out of academic if there would be other options to do a in a critical	
have an application that we wish to install just a basic shell as the users use it will download and install the necessary dlls for actions that need to take place a wizard application scenario with several possible everything is installed for all possible paths through the shell about 3 months out of the the dlls used for the possible paths go through a high churn rate with so we wish to start ensuring the users have the most recent version of these the idea is that after all their selections are make a web check to see what dlls are required for their selection and check to make sure they have the most recent version of those of this we have a plan for on how to do the problem fighting is what is the most appropriate way to these clickonce is not an much legacy stuff our app is installed in which obviously has restrictions for writing random files into the install folder under vista and now i see the options as the install mark the install directory as writable for the i actually tested to see if this would work or if vista does something different in this the download portion out into a second app that we can have prompt for elevated privileges so that it can download and install these leaning towards the second option since that maintains the security aspect of the program files others in the group lean towards the first option because they just want to have to worry about or is there some other option app is a though it has some requirements of third party dlls that are not managed is the best way for on demand download and install of dlls in

have no idea why someone downvoted this it seems a perfectly valid question to maybe they just had their coffee yet this seem to be asking what iunknown and idispatch have to do with i will try to give a brief com component exposes a common iunknown has the methods and and are used to support reference so that when every reference to an object has been released the object will be is kind of like version of the operator in it is used by client code to see if the iunknow pointer they have actually points to an object of another like or every com component must implement but most com libraries will implement this for you automatically so when you are writing com code you typically have to write any code to get you get it for are kind of like just like in real life two people can have exactly the same in com two com components can also have the same for you can have 2 libraries that both implement the idog but they may do totally different you should still be able to have both libraries installed on your machine and distinguishing between the two is what guids are used a guid is a globally unique meaning that when you generate in theory no other person on earth at any othher point in time will ever be able to create the same so in addition to a every com object and has a is another base interface much like but unlike iunknown which is required for every com idispatch is and provides special functionality that many but not all com objects things like supporting certian language features and making your object easier to use by most com object expose this com they must be registered in

have one web application running at the web server root which provides multiple web sites by using url to give a real world works very the only problem is all of these different shops share the same session object the inproc session manager stores the session object in the i would like the shops of company1 and company2 to have different session so for if a user opens the shops of company1 and company2 in different tabs of the same browser the items put in the shopping cart of company1 show up in the cart of are a few obvious approaches to solve this problem that i my own session object which encapsulates everything into a and then stores it in the that breaks all existing code that uses the session urls like and a wildcard dns because the session id cookie is tied to the ugly the equivalent of is already long my own custom session that would be kind of like reinventing the a separate iis application for every because creating new companies should be possible through something like without any human intervention thinking more of a solution along the lines the path of the session cookie to to use different appdomains depending on the any information on how to achieve one of these points maybe a different solution would be multiple session objects in a single

have read in an image using so it is probably coming in as the help for imread says the result will be integer of some order for a tiff what class was i when it was then filtered the it appears that imfilter will return an integer image for an integer input you add using from the online help for it internally converts the image to a adds the gaussian then converts back to integer so your blurred image should still be probably uint8 help for fspecial says it will return a double precision output for called deconvolucy with only two so it is using the default value for argue that this should not fail the author of deconvolucy appears not to have supplied a default value that was consistent in type with the knowing enough about the ipt or i might first suggest this using two different one of these calls did not fix the it suggests that deconvolucy expects a double input for the the online help for deconvolucy was not specific it says only that i may be an n dimensional array or a cell further on in the it calls the result a numeric so i believe that the image for deconvolucy is expected to be a floating point my this is a flaw in the would then probably try scaling your image to as a it is just a guess so something assumes your image was uint8 in class

header handling in php is actually not very flexible and go as far as saying that especially the use two namespaces within the header will make it impossible to inject the header simply by using a of some think the best way to handle this one is to shape the xml request yourself by overriding in a custom class that extends extends public function new do your processing using dom insert security header and so return see for further information and some	
headers have to be this as bad as it could since modern compilers provide some sort of option for not processing them repeatedly with something like or an every header has to be processed once for each translation and that can add up usual practice is for header files to only those header files they and to use forward declarations as much as that you get the you want to everything and its you can provide your own header file that you have to explicitly write everything out in every header and source that option is something you can but if everything in std came as one monolithic you have an

i completely agree with the answer that pick the cleanest and optimize if it becomes a another way to look at it is that the fastest solution is the one that describes your intent most in this foreach says that like to apply some action for each element in the plain for loop say that like a counter you want to repeatedly add one to this value and as long as it is less than the number of elements in the you would like to perform some other the plain for loop overspecifies the it adds a lot of requirements that actually part of what trying to you about the loop but as soon as you write a for it has to be the other the qt people have made no additional promises that may affect they simply guarantee to iterate through the container and apply an action to other often the cleanest and most elegant solution is also the

i trying to drive a screw with possibly reading this you have a situation where actions within a controller have different access so you want to remove the duplication by creating a single check looking to do something like the parameter in parens thing is not and i still see a fair bit of duplication with an area of functionality as as controller if you do probably because looking at something the wrong that rails is proud to describe itself as would it be if you were able to know the action name in your filter is pretty could define permissions in a which seem to encapsulate the distinct elements of the if it got complex then the whole thing could move off into a although then probably duplicating functionality already available in a for in return if to that area requires additional something works on my current rails version although the rails book mentions an method that seems to return blank for

i worked with struts2 in a pretty certain it supports multiple ajax i presume you looked at various ajax the options in struts 2 on what you want to ajax tags although i used i believe would be similar to the ajax also the dojo which again provided server side tags to bind to dojo but just noticed that its been you are doing more had good success with the json which lets you send json to the server have it deserialised bound directly to your actions then serialise your results back to json for the this allows you to use jquery your javascript library of and talk to the server in both directions using json makes for a very clean simple solution as the end result allows you to effectively use your business directly in your javascript

if only interested in the highest n occurring one way to do it is in two with the first pass based on a modified instead of using a bit map to track hash use an integer array instead either 16 32 bit or even 64 bit depending on your input where a bloom filter simply sets the bit corresponding to each of the hash values of a increment the count at the hash index in the problem with this approach is that two words will probably give the same hash so you need to do a second pass where you ignore words unless their hash totals are above a certain thus reducing the amount of memory you need to allocate to do accurate just create a bit map with bits set for the highest occurring hash then in the second pass of the if a word has in the bitmap for its look it up or add it to a hash table and increment its this minimises memory usage by creating a hash table of only the highest occurring	
if overriding you want to override the reason for this is because both are used to compare equality of your is used when checking we know the pointer likely to we can compare the internal if return mytype foo o as if return if return return is generally used by hash the hashcode generated by your class should always be the same for a classes give typically int hashcode hashcode return will say that the hashcode should only be calculated once per object but i agree with that probably the default implementation provided by unless you have the same reference to one of your they will not be equal to each by overriding equals and you can report equality based on internal values rather than the objects

internationalizing a python with two goals in application loads classes from multiple each with its own i18n so modules in package a are using domain modules in package b are using domain locale can be changed while the application is module makes internationalizing a application very you just set the then call which finds the right and installs its method in the global namespace as but obviously a global value only works for a single and since it loads a single it only works for that could instead load the at the top of each and bind its ugettext method as then each module would be using the for its own but this still breaks when the locale is because is for the wrong i guess i could load the correct at the top of every but that seems awfully an alternative would be to still do it but instead of binding i would substitute my own which would check the current get its and forward the string to does anyone have a cleaner is the best way to internationalize a python app with multiple i18n

is arguably more art than you have to remember is that like many things in programming and your website will be as slow as the slowest link in the meaning you will have some bottleneck such as the web disk your your etc that will limit the speed of your and growing your web site will involve identifying those issues as you grow and addressing at one point you may need to add more at another you may need another cpu and so at other times adding more memory might be useless because memory your lack of a certain resource can be like lack of memory can be masked by intensive disk as your system swaps constantly but disk the what do you first thing is you need to identify make a reasonable as to what a typical user will do and how much they will do ideally you will be able to model 100 or 1000 or however many users you need with software like jmeter to then get an idea of how your website how much bandwidth is going to be required and so by modelling 2000 users you will hopefully be able to see how linearly you web site may find that supporting 1000 users requires 1 gig of ram but 2000 requires 4 an example of scalability that expoes a problem you will have scaling your web site and the kind of thing to be revealed by performance hardware is so cheap these days that rarely a problem except for the biggest and most popular of sites can buy you 1 or even 2 servers with 16g of ram and cores shared and vps hosting are a different story because typically only want to pay for however much bandwidth and disk space you luckily those kinds of solutions tend to alow you to upgrade pretty easily least to a point where eventually have to go dedicating can make some dirty estimates at the beginning of a project by doing what they call of the run key queries say 100 times and work out hwo much cpu time they hit a mocked up page 100 times and work out how much bandwidth it generates and so these rough estimates combined with guesses about how users will use the site will give you a ballpark within a factor of of what

is because you have to accepts an instance and returns its in this case you have to compare two you need to do preemptive it is better if you check for a supported interface than the type does not really tell you apart of the fact that your code want an instance of a specific regardless of the fact that you could have another instance of a completely different type which would be perfectly fine because it implements the same suppose you have this return suppose you i want this code to accept only a if raise accepts only a return is reducing the reusability of this it work if you pass a or a or a something better would be if not and raise return no point in doing will raise an exception if the protocol is not satisfied this of course unless you want to prevent side effects or having to recover from calls that you could invoke before just to make the if not and raise return this your code will raise an exception before running the without interface you would have removed the and then raised the

just occurred to is a wild guess and probably not but maybe having a delayed ack problem due to your send buffer being smaller than the size of the data nagle may have nothing to do with the receiving side send any data back if your peer will delay ack for up to 200ms waiting to piggy back ack on some data to make better use of the send buffer on the socket is smaller than the data in this case the call to write will block until the ack has been received and all the data example if your send buffer is 8192 bytes and you send 8193 bytes and your peer sends no data back then your write will block for 200ms or however long your peers implementation delays the effectively making it look like nagle is killing you even when this is the case you could either increase the send buffer size or have your peer always send you back a null byte to force the ack to be sent i would maybe try playing around with a bit to model your applications send receive patterns and see if maybe something else is going

looks to me that you are just starting with because even though the browsers do not adhere to the css specification there is a lot of safe ground that you can use with this safe ground is nowadays much larger than it used to be about ten years when coding for web was really a royal and new browser releases adhere to the specification more and which is exactly why the standard it is a kind of theoretical ideal that the browsers will probably never fully but even percent of it are quite useful in the real also wish ie would have better implementation of but once you learn the few things that behave you can code most of the usual layouts without major most common layouts have also been discussed to death on various css forums on the web and there is always some good solution readily available so that you do not have to make it up css standard is imho not the problem least not in the sense of your the problem is the reality of the browser market and the software market in as for the it should mostly go away after you gain some the limits will always be but there is a plenty of safe	
loop you have there executes that script and runs for every line the script basically this means that your environment variable contains only the line of the output it gets overwritten each time the loop processes another so if your script will contain only if the last line is empty or contains only spaces iot will effectively delete which is why when you do only get is since after variable substition all left there is you can which case be getting an empty line would be what contains at that you want to print every line the script returns to a file then you can do that much easier by simply doing use for redirection if you want the output to be appended to the as kniazev pointed you just want to store the last then the following might in do if not set will only set in case the loop variable

love to hear from the programmers about why mvc with java said to fall there is absolutely nothing wrong with implementing mvc in just about any a not a language never heard anyone say in java falls before my guess is that either the quote was taken out of context or the person who made the statement has little experience with java or intended something to use the classes in cocoa just to write a cocoa nice that and that all kinds of great support in the tools interface to use and there are probably very few cases where you use but nothing fundamental to the language that makes an mvc implementation than an mvc implementation that was coded in just as the cocoa frameworks provide all kinds of great support for mvc with the various controller and view there are scores of good frameworks for java which provide support for implementing	
made several attempts at writing this exact piece of i can say you be able to do this with absolute and you certainly be able to detect all of the uri forms allowed by the since you have a very limited set of urls interested you can use any of the techniques the other thing i can say with a great deal of is that if you really want to beat the best way to do that is to use send a chunk of javascript that performs some and repeat the calculation on the server the javascript should copy the result of the calculation to a hidden field so that when the comment is the result of the calculation is submitted as verify on the server side that the calculation is the only way around this technique is for spammers to manually enter comments or for them to start running a javascript engine just for i used this technique to reduce the spam on my site from to one or two per now the only spam i ever get is entered by humans weird to get

method of dynamically loading script files using dom methods like is meaning that the page does not wait for it to load before running any further if you did not want this asynchronous you could load them with regular elements in your or you could mess around with a xmlhttprequest to grab it and to run probably want to do because being asynchronous makes the entire page load you will probably just need to add some logic that waits for the dynamically loaded script to have loaded before you go on with the next bit of this involve polling using until you notice a variable from the included script has been you could add code in the included script that calls a method to whatever has been waiting for you could look at how jquery does something look for where the ajax method is specifically these script then later if do script

my predecessor know something i or am i right to be saying when i look at this your predecessor you are see note at the seems like insanely inefficient and difficult to maintain like and it makes running reports extra difficult because the data i need could be contained in text fields or it might be in one of a dozen tables that have similar information and are used in different parts of the insanely see note at the column should always be an indivisible attribute of the i see two copies of three attributes in this column be description color would have been better designed code primary desc txnid something primary txnid something txnseq int primary quantity code foreign key price possible that this was done to preserve historical information in the face of changing values elsewhere in the for if the description of a stock item changes or the item is not the right way to handle in that foreign key constraints would have stopped the item code from being deleted and processes should have been in place to prevent the description from being updated as versioning the stock item if going to search on any of the items within that this is perfectly though unwise in terms of possible future functionality to search on the only thing ever searched on in this table is the customer code then a text field is still do it that way but a yagni argument can be made that it would be better to change the db schema in the if and when that search functionality needs to be

names in php start with so is the name of a is a special variable in object oriented programming in which is reference to current is used to access an object member properties or in like the syntax in your code means the value of variable into the entryid field of this operator in means pass here is a output is note the output is the above because we used a reference to where is pointing is stored in so is actually a pointer to arguments are passed by value by default by so when calling a when you pass in your they are copied by value not by this is the default in most however there is a way to have pass by reference when defining a what ever you will affect the actual parameter outside the output is are many functions that behave like like the function that sorts an array will affect directly on the array and will not return another sorted is something interesting to note because mode could result in more memory and php is an interpreted language programs written in php are not as fast as compiled to make the code run faster and minimize memory there are some tweaks in the php one is not sure about the which means you are coping a variable into php will copy a reference to the first variable into the second so your new is actually a reference to the first one until the value is not copied but if you try to change any of these php will make a copy of the and then changes the this way you will have the opportunity to save memory and if you do not change the points to equals to now php will copy 3 into and places 4 into all if you want to place the value of into property of your the above code will do and will not copy the value of until you change any of results in less memory if you actually want them both to point to the same then use	
natural inclination is to look at a bracket in the order the games are you read the traditional diagram from the outside but think of it the other way each game is played between two one the other a bit more to it than just the winners of a particular pair of games face off against each other in another so also a relationship between the games irrespective of playing in those that the teams that face off in each game in the first are the winners of two earlier you might notice that each game has two that precede it and determine who faces off in that this sounds exactly like a binary each root node has at most two child if you know who wins each you can easily determine the teams in the to design a database to model you really only need two and each has two foreign keys that relate to other the names but we would model them as separate keys to enforce the requirement that each game have no more than two preceding call them and to keep with the binary tree we should have a key called that tracks the reverse as i noted you can easily determine the teams that face off in each game by looking at who won the two preceding so you really only need to track the winner of each give the entity a foreign key to the the small matter of seeding the that modeling the for the first round you could model this by having a for each team in the overall competition where that team is the and has no preceding the overall schema would other attributes as you see other attributes as you see you would add all the other information want to the outcome case the game was won by forfeit or some other out of the ordinary

never heard of this technique it just looks interesting so done a few searches and what i think found hopefully someone who knows what talking about will contribute think supposed to be a better way of generating branch coverage not a complete substitute for path a far longer document here which restates the goals a onjava article says goal of basis path testing is to test all decision outcomes independently of one testing the four basis paths achieves this making the other paths think here to the goal of basis path not as one might complete waste of think the point of testing branches is to break those accidental correlations between the paths which and the paths you that occur with terrifying frequency when i write both the code and an arbitrary set of branch coverage tests no magic in the linear just a systematic way of generating branch which discourages the tester from making the same assumptions as the programmer about correlation between branch basis path testing misses your and in general misses where n is the cyclomatic it just aims not to miss the paths likely to be as letting the coder choose n paths to test typically does

new here but picked up on this thread through the realbasic user i think my position was similar to i did website design for my using mostly javascript a little not i had a pascal and basic dabbled it c but like the level of detail you needed to monitor it reminded me too much of assembly i still have nightmares about from my was looking for a with a familiar feel to but initially started with vb because it was i prefer programming in macos so i tried i found that ui builder was much easier to use than echo other comments that the community is the most responsive of any user groups been involved since used realbasic and my mac to make several programs that over 100 users use every day at my work mostly xp and received compliments on the polish and ease of use of these you have to remember to adjust the things to make it look right cross platform default button placement is opposite on pc button sizes are different on many people have donated custom classes that do this stuff for you seem to assume that a language cannot be powerful enough for their while it is basic at core and it your much more oop than anything else based upon an which for me was easy to pick they have a free so grab a demo and run through the if you get ask for questions on the nug or forums at the website and likely get an answer

others are is not the right way to do are some about why your attempt to use is only clearing for your sample that apparently is coincidentally the bytes occupied by the simple fix would be to write which in this case would set both and if your class has any virtual methods and the usual mechanism is used to represent them by your then that will destroy the and break the instance by setting the pointer to which is problem is that if the type requires some constructor action more complex than just settings its bits to then the constructors for the members are but their effect is ruined by overwriting the content of the members with only correct action is to write your default constructor to just forget about trying to use for this at pointed out in a comment that the default constructors for and were actually called before the in the original code as while technically calling overwrites the members which is at best really bad and at worst invokes the demons of undefined the class is as long as the type is also plain old data as would be the case if were or all it would take is for to be some sort of value class to cause problems that could be really hard to if you were they would manifest early through access violations from dereferencing the null pointers created by but lady luck is a fickle and the more likely outcome is that some memory is leaked and the application gets or more op asked in a comment on another answer there a way to make memset answer there is chosen the and chosen to take full advantage of you have to pay for those advantages by using the language it simply correct to bypass the constructor in the general while there are circumstances under which it is and sensible to call in a this just one of	
others has you prevent the user from starting a new session without resorting to activex or other the basic problem is that there is no way for you to know whether a user closed the old browser window or left it you can do is to invalidate the previous session as soon as the user logs into a new bit similar to how may instant messaging clients each assign a new guid to the user in your also store this guid in the session cache need to ship it back and forth to the which work for get requests on each page compare the guid assigned to the user in the database with the guid in the session if they return a have logged in from somewhere i was a bit too fast on the this prevent the scenario where the user opens multiple within the same browser so you would have to combine this solution with dave anderson suggestion for storing a viewstate hash simply a so that only the last served page in a session is allowed to post you can only rely on this framework as a convenience to the user since not any half decent hacker will be able to circumvent these

others the cast removes the of the destination as far as the expression is when you use a cast the compiler treats the expression according to the cast as long as the cast itself it valid casts are pretty much the big this is why you get an error or essentially telling the i know what this is how you should treat in casts are probably the way for programmers to get the compiler to stop issuing assignment expression may or may not be undefined it is permitted to cast away constness the object actually pointed to is not if the object pointed to is then you have undefined void const const float float x const float y well defined not particularly great undefined return treading dangerous general sure there are casting so that expressions treat objects as they really are is behavior in particular behavior is covered in the standards mostly by statements that modifying a const object through a cast that removes the const qualifier is the inference is that doing the same for a object is not an example given in the standard makes this type qualifiers an attempt is made to modify an object defined with a type through of an lvalue with the behavior is the pointer or reference to a type need not actually point or refer to a but it is treated as if it a access path cannot be used to modify an object even if the object referenced is a object and can be modified through some other access supported by the type system so that they cannot be subverted without casting that any class member declared mutable can be any attempt to modify a object during its lifetime results in undefined i to const access path to attempt to modify through ptr to needed to convert const points to a ciq new const int as iq modifies a const

per other using a cname should only cause very minimal additional dns resolution and only if the result is not already in the recursive dns that dns clients routinely ask explicitly for cname typically ask for whatever record type they actually want for a web browser that would be an or the job of the upstream servers to recognise that the queried domain name has a cname entry in and then look up and return the target in this case both the cname record and the required result are returned in the of the dns response not in the as someone else optimum performance best that the target of the cname be hosted on the same authoritative dns server as the domain name that contains the cname so that the cname resolution can be done without further dns

possible explanation is that you could forget parts of a change the change sets that you are merging cover files that are outside the subdirectory that you have checked then there is always the possibility that you will forget to merge those if you have a commit like this on rich 16 apr 2 m m some you then have a checkout of subdir1 from your branch then you could merge the change set r5 like svn co cd svn merge 5 merging r5 into svn ci r5 from this will only merge half of revision worse if you go back and look at the it will now show svn log rich 16 apr 2 m m some it looks like merged the whole when in fact you have only merged some of of course r6 does show that only 1 file has changed on the stable rich 16 apr 1 m m revision 5 from has to or that only part of the change set got merged and the rest needs not using subdirectory merges avoids this are times when you really want to merge all of a previous and the above scenario is exactly what you intended to in that it is probably best to add a good commit message describing your	
possible i use references over the reason for this is that a lot harder to screw up a reference than a people can always pass null to a pointer value but there is no such equivalent to a only real downside is there reference parameters in have a lack of call site some people believe that makes it harder to understand code i agree to an i usually define the following in my code and use it for fake call site of course enforce call site it just provides a very lame way of documenting i did some experimentation with a template which enforces call site this is more for fun than for actual production code

practices for speeing up your web from yahoo includes the following users request a it can take anywhere from 200 to 500ms for the backend server to stitch together the html during this the browser is idle as it waits for the data to in php you have the function it allows you to send your partially ready html response to the browser so that the browser can start fetching components while your backend is busy with the rest of the html the benefit is mainly seen on busy backends or light good place to consider flushing is right after the head because the html for the head is usually easier to produce and it allows you to include any css and javascript files for the browser to start fetching in parallel while the backend is still js content the point at which the flush occurs here is after the head tag is this makes a lot of sense so the browser can begin loading images and scripts while the remainder of the page is rendered and there a way to flush after the head any other part of the explicitly using i flush the buffer early using

prefer writing the ui that first i write the backend classes which implement the behaviour of the without any dependencies to the presentation of the ui without swing or any other ui after that i write a thin presentation layer with an ui where all the event handlers delegate to the ui backend should be just without any the benefit of this is that you can easily write tests for the which in turn makes it easier to change and maintain the see the links at for more a higher first implement the features which will produce the most value to the try to get something to show as early as so that you can get feedback from the users and improve any deficiencies in the you can fake most of the background services example the database and business so that the ui can be even though it does not yet really do

probably already read this section of docs about memory but point you to the section about the ownership just in you are only responsible for managing the memory of objects you to quote the own any object you an object using a method whose name begins with or or contains or you own an you are responsible for relinquishing ownership when you have finished with you do not own an you must not release section of those docs provide good but to put the points above in the context of your specific am i supposed to memory manage these good news you ignore the the memory management aspect of the objects in your they just created or did they always may have always or they may have just been the beauty of is that as a consumer of those have to i retain and if i release the object that created will they be released as need to retain them if just passing them on to some other or using them as intermediate values yourself in your own calculations within the for that returning the from your example function to someone no point in retaining it just to return you do happen to retain then you are responsible for issuing a corresponding release message as some you for retain the from your example if you want to hold on to that value as a property in your own uses reference if you need that object to stick around for a long you must retain it so that someone release message cause it to vanish if the retain count falls to they say you ask for a string from if has to create that string just special for you order to service your but otherwise care about that then probably put that string into the autorelease if the string was already a property of and it was just sending it to you in response to your then it probably the beauty you know and need to since created the it is responsible for managing you can ignore the memory management unless you add to the string by sending it a retain if i run a million times in a can i dispose of all those nsstrings as yours to manage because you create as a technical if really did have to create 1 million copies of to service your 1 million it probably put them all in an autorelease which would be drained at the end of the current cocoa event unless you send each of those objects a retain you can gleefully ignore the memory management question

question follows on very closely to one i asked earlier but i do not think they are the same thing so thought it was sensible to split them up is a little ironic when you hear the have a web application that was split into two the dll that contained the busines logic layer methods and dal they where split into different namespaces but all within the same more i looked at it and extended the development the more i realized i was very much going down the wrong i wanted to split them up into separate so that i could have a clear separation of i had the code in different i realized that a lot of classes called each for example when a list of client objects were created in the dal it would also call the and get a list of companies that the clients belonged so i now had two classes that directly referenced each this seems like a rather bad it smelt bad but i carried on and tried to separate things out where i that end i took all the objects out to interfaces and changed all references to them to the was hoping to use some sort of di learning about that at the so for each object i created a constructor that took in a factory for that factory would create a new instance of each object that the class might i also put a default constructor in that would call the di constructor with a default factory to ensure that there was always one factory all compiled so i gave it a spin and got a this is were i fully realized that if i have two classes that require each other you can not instantiate without the iclient return new icompany return new private icompany public this public public client do stuff to get client from got client object and companyid from return private iclient public this public public company do stuff to get a company out and client for each client id return i going about the di thing all is it that factory idea should i avoid the classes needed each the reason they are like that at the moment is to avoid repeated i am sure i could write cleaner sql to get it all out in one or at least in a couple of queries in the same but i was trying to avoid repeating code in different for any and all design with

really recommend but you should be able to modify the that checks for weak keys using and the it took a while for me to load all of it up in my virtual machine and want to mess with the reflexil view tools reflexil the can use functions will come doubleclick the one found in should have come up in the instructions scroll all the way down to line 29 to this means the function will always return your assemblies pane you can now scroll up and click on language runtime the reflexil pane will give you an option to save up your original assembly is a signed assembly and you will need the sdk for reflexil to make it skip i just checked this you should already have this with visual just click it for verification skipping this when asked think i have to tell you to only use this on your development machine if you need additional please feel free to use the completely removed the isweakkey check from the function in the mscorlib i am absolutely certain that i modified the correct and that i did it disassembler does no longer show the the funny thing is that visual still throws the same leads me to believe that mscorlib must somehow still be cached renaming to leads to so it must still be dependent on the original is quite interesting but i think reached the point where i have no clue what is going it just make any see attached notice in that unlike assemblies such as mscorsec and actually located in what appears to be a think i am missing something here will investigate this some after having patched out everything in and played around with both removing and generating new native images of using i am getting the same i must be noted that even after uninstalling the native mscorlib it is still using give i hope someone will be able to answer what the hell is going on because i sure	
really tried audiofilestream api for this rolled our own but a few things you have to take care you have no problem the byte then you have to keep tracking the relationship between mp3 frame number and the absolute byte stream just as paul i assume you can do that in your by calling audiofilestreamseek along the the trickier when you do random you have to reset the internal states of because it might be in some intermediate state expecting the next incoming bytes to complete the current not sure if you can just feed zeros to have it skip the current and start over you have to as i see anything like audiofilestreamreset in the the audio queue does have reset function that you can clean up at any rate you have to take care of your too because going to parse a part of the byte stream which you already have kept track you just find the start of a mp3 frame by relying on the second and the even with rate mp3 there can be paddings every other few so the most accurate information still comes from the should quickly add that another way to do random seeking is simply the parsed packets if not playing a really long and large frame index can be calculated from the frame header for non vbr frames per second is a constant frames per sec for khz stereo check out mp3 spec for why

seeing is a bit of legacy code showing its the heart of the matter is the visual basic used the type for its boolean true for a is represented with the value which has the integer value during the conversion to it was decided that when using visual basic conversion routines to convert a boolean value to an integer visual basic semantics would be maintained on the return it would be first implicit conversion occurs with the b i under the hood this does an implicit conversion from integer to any value is deemed to be therefore the resulting value is the following line of code is doing an implicit conversion to an integer the hood this uses one of the visual basic conversion routines or to convert the value to an as such visual basic semantics are in play and the value returned is next interesting line is the this is using a conversion routine which does not use visual basic it returns the underlying representation for a true boolean value which is

the answer to your question depends on how your data member is distinguish two types of data members in a use the common term to refer to data are the logical state or of the attributes are rarely declared as have coined the protologism it denote members that are simply that are somewhat divorced from the state of the have no contextual relevance to the user of the exist in the class only to contribute to the efficient operation of the are usually declared in the class as mutable and are or example say your object is a linked you have a pointer to the first item in the would consider this pointer a contribute because does not represent the data in the if the list is sorted and is set to the new first item in the user of the list object could care less how the is only that the list data has modified or not and that the the list is sorted or not to the if you had a booean data member to quickly the list is in a sorted that too would be a it is the list structure itself which imbues the sorted variable member is used simply to efficiently remember the having to scan the another if you have a const method that searches the you know that typically the search will return recently previously searched for would keep a pointer in your class to such a item so your first check if the last found item matches the search key before entire list the method does indeed need to search the list and the pointer would be pointer i would consider to be a contribute because only there to help speed up the even though updates the pointer the method is because none of the data in the container are data members that are attributes are usually not declared data members that contribute to the functioning of an object will usually be

the sense that a code smell is an indicator of a potential need for refactoring are private methods a code was looking at some of my own code and it dawned on me that many of my public methods actually do anything other than consolidate private methods of the same none of the private methods relied on any member got me thinking and i started looking through other everywhere i looked was the same private methods with little or no dependence on data in the class they were defined struck me that these private methods really belong to the classes they were of course extracting them to new classes would mean making them public so there was no point to them being private in the first this universal to all private methods or have i just not looked long enough to find private methods that look like they belong in the class their from the responses the general consensus on this site seems to be that they are i was curious if there were some who i stumbled across a on that brings up some interesting any case it seems that by themselves private methods really indicate any particular opportunity for thanks for all the private methods in general a code

think most people are missing the point of it looks to me like asking about what inheritance is asking about subclasses implementing functionality that is not a natural fit for a base and the resulting mess that can the pushing of specific methods functionality up the hierarchy or requiring that subclasses implement a contract for functionality that a natural is also the matter of whether it is valuable to be able to treat a base class like the subclass in every case avoid casting and use them this is called the liskov substitution principle for reminding

think that for seo needs you should stick to ascii characters in the many more characters are allowed in in practice most systems only parse ascii many scripts choke on so allowing urls with characters in your urls drastically reduces the change of your link showing up in user generated you want an example of such a take a look at the stackoverflow it chokes on parenthesis for could also take a look to handle diacritics when rewriting accepted solution there is to transiterate the this	
think that if that memory is not accessible by gdb then it is not mapped into your process address space and so you get access memory at addresss if that application were run normally you would get a segmentation maybe your driver is screwed and you should check you actually can access the memory from within the try with example int fd addr for x x return

think that learning the language is not in i used to be a full time and at some point i started writing java but the thing is that i remember ever learning so i guess i just figured it as i been doing full time java for a long time you are well familiar with you may want to read a list of the major differences everything is and then start practicing on an environment download the small differences are the main thing you would have to get adjusted that java supports one of the major switching pains is multiple while not is not a big deal if you get used to and in fact having interfaces rather than abstract classes with pvfs improves me java is a nice and friendly and relaxing sandboxed version of i have to worry about i have to worry about memory i have to worry about messing with let that confuse there are still plenty of opportunities to screw up and sometimes even nastier to take the if you have the it be a

think the answer to this will depend on what you want to do in the event a symbol does come in at exactly the same could create a unique index on the symbol and the datetime column but this would cause a unique key violation for one of the two if designing for this could be an expensive option is to have a timestamp which would insure that even if you do happen to get two identical symbols at the exact same your insert will not real question is what do you want to do with that second identical can you afford the expense of checking to see if an identical symbol and datetime already exists in the table before you write to so you could then log and discard the

think what you need is navigation should have a navigation controller that has your rss reader as root view then whenever a user selects a story in your rss create an instance of a new view controller that has a webview as you can then pass the url to the new web view and the webview onto your navigation you have to do then is tell the webview to load the url you passed and do its when the user is all they have to do is hit the back button that gets created for you by the navigation

think you could get around this by using a generic list instead of an going to assume you use generics for one reason or need to tell the compiler what type is contained in the arraylist so it can serialize it since all it knows it that it contains this above your property and it should clear it replace with whatever class is contained in the

this is really misstated or just not getting application requests the web page and gets it and has to ascertain if it is another or this is to say that part of the web request to return the true or false at the beginning which is where my first confusion why you doing a similar comparison on the false cases and seeing if there are sufficient similarities to create 3 buckets of results for some random page page is more similar to true and thus is viewed as page is more similar to false and thus is viewed as page more similar to either and thus the result is something like a null or exception situation as it possible to discern which result makes of where that 3rd case could the page contains an integer and if positive the result is true and if negative the result is what if the result is does 0 count as positive since it is equal to its absolute value or does it count as a negative for some am i way off in what you are trying to do

though i will focus on point i begin by giving my 2 cents on the whole issue of unless differences are big or usage is usually i bother about microseconds that when added amount to any visible difference to the i emphasize that i only care when considering called where i do have special performance considerations is on the way i design the application i care about about the use of about clever ways to call methods to make several calls or to try to make only one whether to pool connections or in fact i usually focus on raw but on i care if it runs better by a tiny slice of a nanosecond for a single but i care a lot to have the ability to load the system with big amounts of simultaneous users without noticing the said here goes my opinion about point i love anonymous they give me great flexibility and code the other great feature about anonymous methods is that they allow me to directly use local variables from the container method a not from an il of they spare me loads of code when do i use anonymous evey single time the piece of code i need needed if it is used in two different i like as a reuse so use a plain just like shoosh it good to have code in theory there are no performance differences as anonyms are not il of what i think about anonymous methods applies to lambda as the latter can be used as a compact syntax to represent anonymous assume the following public static void used to represent an anonymous foreach item in if receives an array of strings and for each one of it will call the method passed to if that method returns it will say you can call this method the following names return p you can also call it the following p p is no difference in il between the being that the one using the lambda expression is much more once there is no performance impact as these are all compiler tricks jit compiler just as i feel we are overusing anonymous i feel we are overusing lambda expressions to represent anonymous of the same logic applies to repeated do use regular there are other restrictions leading you back to anonymous methods or plain like out or ref argument other nice things about lambda expressions is that the exact same syntax need to represent an anonymous lambda expressions can also you take the following public static void used to represent an binaryexpression bexpr as if is a binary node type is left side is right side is if constantexpression right value of the right side is the slightly different the second parameter receives an expression and not a the way to call this method would p p is exactly the same as the call we made when creating an anonymous method with a the difference here is that we are not creating an anonymous but creating an expression it is due to these expression trees that we can then translate lambda expressions to which is what linq 2 sql for instead of executing stuff in the engine for each clause like the the the nice thing is that the calling syntax is the same whether creating an anonymous method or sending an

true confession maybe just but sometimes practices for program on windows machines feels like changed more than data access still running and somewhere along the way just kind about where ms wanted me to store all my i controlled all the machines i coded so it really writing apps for the supporting win98se on i have to pay attention to all this reasons having to do mostly with easy migration to new not a big fan of using the registry for app settings i prefer using ini and have some older ini components that i use for the task open to suggestions to other if make this easier less i need to store app settings remembering option at least not alone in this for what is somewhat of a repeat albeit from a slightly different sounds like i can just use and store all data is this universally true across all windows flavors from win98se on if the best and when did that approach come into really looking is the easiest way to make this problem go away i just want one reliable way to grab data in any and all will the above accomplish approach for storing settings db files on various windows

understanding of async is that notified when done via an interrupt of some sort so you can do more at that with buffered you do it and forget about you never hear about that particular least how it is with the huge intelligent disk arrays we deal idea of async is that you begin the and return to doing other when the is notified and can do more in other not waiting around for it to for the synchronous read you request some input and then wait around while read from the buffering there just involves reading more than you need so available on the next read without going out to the device to get you simply start the process to read then you go off and do something else while whether by polling or an you later discover that the read is finished and the data is available for you to not sure i can see the advantage of one over the buffered sync writes will return almost immediately unless the buffer is full the only time when an async write may have an

union contains a set of your particular you can store the float char or int in the memory will only be allocated for the in the all items in the union will share the same of in other writing one value into the union followed by another will cause the first value to be need to go back and ask yourself you are you truly want the values of and to be mutually exclusive only one value can exist at if consider using a union in conjunction with an enum value outside the indicating which member in the union is the one at any particular point in this will allow you to get the memory benefits of using a at the cost of more dangerous code anyone maintaining it will need to be aware that the values are mutually exclusive it is indeed a consider this option if you are creating many of these unions and memory conservation is vital on embedded you may not even end up saving memory because you will need to create enum variables on the stack which will take up memory you want these values to be simultaneously active and not interfere with each if you will need to use a struct instead you put in your first this will use more memory when you instantiate a the memory that is allocated is the sum of all members some padding to the nearest word memory conservation is of paramount importance previous i would favour this example of how to use enums in conjunction with a float char int floatcharintunion unionselection selection selection selection unionselection switch case process case process case process

use packed structures that are overlaid directly over the binary packet in memory today and i am rueing the day that i decided to do the only way that we have gotten this to work is defining specific types based on the compilation environment unsigned int the appropriate pragmas in to specify tight packing of structure that everything is in one byte order network or writing both the server and client you are just starting i would advise you to skip the whole mess of trying to represent on the wire with just serialize each primitive element if you choose not to use an existing library like boost serialize or a middleware like then save yourself a lot of headache by writing an abstraction around a binary buffer that hides the details of your serialization aim for an interface bytebuffer void void void void void void each of your classes would have a method to serialize to a or be deserialized from a and this is one of those things that i absolutely wish that i could go back in time and i cannot count the number of times that i have spent time debugging an issue that was caused by forgetting to swap bytes or not packing a other trap to avoid is using a to represent bytes or to an unsigned char buffer to extract if you always use on the then you can use simple code to write the bytes to the buffer and not worry about the remains nicely platform agnostic since the numerical representation is always logically this code also lends itself very nicely to using templates based on the size of the primitive type char not so but very easy to write and

way is to use the feature of sql management have resolved it with a function and a couple of to obtain the create table for a table named you have to execute just the procedure called is the tsql script function que a partir de un tipo de datos y una devuelve el texto del por para y declare set select case when name in then else end case when 1 then else from systypes t where return procedure declare tablaf tablar colf colr fkname obtengo las llaves foraneas en declare declare insert into select as as as as as from sysforeignkeys sysobjects sysobjects sysobjects syscolumns syscolumns where and and and and and and and order by set while exists select from select top 1 fkname from set set while exists select from where fkname select top 1 tablar from where fkname delete from where colf and colr and tablar and fkname set set set set set foreign key set set select case when then else procedure nocount obtengo las foreign select que devuelve el script de create table de la when then when then else end sysobjects campos identitys when 1 1 identity then else when not is null defaults then constraint default else sysobjects syscolumns outer join sysobjects od on left outer join syscomments cd on primary keys y unique when then else end sysobjects sysindexes in check check sysobjects syscomments in foreign nocount	
way of doing what you need is to include your file in every page that has the login form and just post to that same so you need any redirection at maybe is not a good scalable and maintainable but it is it all depends what kind of app you are but you are saying that you are new to php so you can start like you can always go fancy

we allowed to say support oracle until it supports the standard sql it seems the least way in many you force a single or maybe a unicode zero width space then you probably have to go the whole hog and use something implausible such as 32 to indicate that the data should be blank but because the dbms in use is	
we have a structure like this to describe a 4x4 type type type type type type type type type type all you have is euler that is an angles representing the and roll and a point in 3d space for the you can calculate the and look note that and look are just the but since this is a i find it easier to name it the simplest way to apply your roations to the camera matrix is to build a series of rotation matrices and multiply our camera matrix by each rotation good reference for that is you have applied all the needed you can set the vector pos to the position in the world before you apply the you need to take the inverse of its this is what you are going to multiply your modelview matrix by before you start drawing for the matrix class the inverse is calculated like orthinv return with all our matrix constuction out of the you would be doing something like cameramatrix rollrotation pitchrotation this

what you are describing is not that you probably already have the requirements written in a functional document if you use a requirements tool like doors then you get those 2 for that you have to sell off your requirements to a customer then mapping the requirements to test cases is how do you prove the system does what it is required to do and each requirement is requirements to design sections has always been a mystery too only on very rare occasions does it add value as timing but the mere fact that you can prove the requirements are met by the test cases makes this mapping nothing more than a lot of one can argue that it helps the but imo the overhead costs much more than it saves and most of the mappings at this level end up being very arbirtrary of the 4 sections you the only one that requires an inordinate amount of time to maintain is the mapping to design i know it is easier said than but try to get your company process changed so you required to do the design section if you get it changed at the company then you can change the software development plan for the project to specify that you be performing that particular

would say that it depends on the in a blog entry or text i would focus on the code to perform or demonstrate the desired i would probably give the obligatory nod to error even put in a check but stub the code with an in you can introduce a lot of confusion by including too much code that focus directly on the subject at in in shorter answers seem to be preferred so handling errors with wave of the may be more appropriate in this context as if i made a code sample available for i would generally make it as complete as possible and include reasonable error the idea here is that for learning the person can always go back to the and use that to help understand the code as actually my personal this is one of the issues that i have with how tdd is typically presented usually you only see the tests developed to check that the code succeeds in the main path of i would like to see more tdd tutorials include developing tests for alternate this aspect of i is the hardest to get a handle on since it requires you to not of what should but of all the things that could go

you are going to use some or this database details will be hidden from the i would decide for a table per sublass mapping resamples the inheritance hierarchy very is no need for an artificial discriminator a new subclass requires only adding a new table while using a table per class hierarchy mapping requires the modification of a table in are no useless empty fields for any rows and there will be more and more useless values if you introduce new subclasses into a table per class hierarchy mapping this is a consequence of the low normalization of the foreign key constraint is easily a or mapper and round trip engineering the creation of even complex inheritance hierarchies is no you think about using hibernate have a look at in the reference

you change the source code for the legacy com have to work around one possibility is to create a new vb6 component that implements and which does the actual work of getting the password by calling back into your this the vb6 code can deal with the and the code see of the code to make it work will be vb6 which you can put into a new activex dll project and reference from your is an outline of the different classes and interfaces this class is a wrapper class that hides the parameter from the when this property is called by the legacy com this class will call a helper class in that will do the actual callback the vb6 class will then take the results from the helper class and return them to the legacy com this class is used to pass the parameters from a call to to the helper class that will doing the real this is the interface that your code will implement instead of implementing is the code listing for each of the vb6 components mentioned you can add this code to a new activex dll project and compile it for use from your each file is listed as an make sure the property for each of these classes is set to to pass arguments ownerneeded as isvalidresult as this is the interface that your class should implement of function args as as property set callbackprovider as set property get byval ownerneeded as byref isresultvalid as as function byval ownerneeded as byref isresultvalid as as if is nothing callback dogetpassword end the arguments in a passwordcallbackargs not need to fill here the callback provider will do dim args as new the password and a value to put back into our byref dogetpassword isresultvalid to use this the above code has been compiled into an activex add a reference to it from your put the code that you would have put into your implementation into a new class that implements remember that the callback parameters and are passsed to your provider class in a so you will have to use and in your class to refer to is a stub provider class to get you a stub implementation of an ipasswordcallbackprovider class mypasswordcallbackprovider implements public function as string implements dim password as string dim resultwasvalid as if other end even more whether the result was valid or return end order to pass a valid to your legacy com you will need to create a set its and then pass the wrapper object to the legacy com the above and assuming you have a instance of your legacy com component called you would do something like the following to set up the create the callback wrapper wrapper new tell the wrapper to call our custom ipasswordcallbackprovider new pass the call back wrapper to the legacy com object sure how this is done in your just pretending a property since i this works because implements the interface that the legacy com object is expecting to the in turn provides a way to hook into the callback process via the the com interface is compatible with so you can write an implementing class using the calls your to do the work of getting the and makes sure to put a value back into the

you find for any reason change of or that the amount of work required for a system over a sprint is greater than the amount available then a problem with your fix is as you you take programmers from other areas and throw them onto the how well this works depends on the skills of that person and how different the problem domain but treating programmers as generic units that can be farmed out as needed is generally not a successful strategy for developing is still a scheduling problem

you mentioned you using recursion but each function has a logical path that calls to the the this can get you in a lot of trouble if your tree is large enough to blow your gcc has limited support for tail but i count on when you delete a child with two you promote the left or right node to the position the deleted node was is a highly simplistic assuming your tree delete code has some recommend walking through it with a few hypothetical immediately obvious to me was a pointer and then deferencing you can always worry about style once you get the correctness thing squared	
you mind dirty reads you can try putting after your table names in your select the trade off here is that you are not guaranteed the most up to date data as update and insert statements currently executing are this is not to much of a as most systems read far more than they but obviously it depends on the nature of your have a look at

you need to compare the image you should retrive all the images from the database and do that from the language that you use for accessing the this is one of the reasons why not a best practice to store images or other binary files in a relational you should create unique file name every time when you want to store an image in a rename the file with this unique file store the image on the disk and insert in your database name on the disk and eventually the original name of the file or the one provided by the user of your

you not just use a static variable specifically for those that will have the same as the you should probably think carefully about any concurrency but it sounds like the simplest way to keep a value just and although one instance of can be used to service multiple each one only serves one request at a time which suggests that multiple instances are created for concurrent request i validated but it does sound like it be safe to keep it in an instance answer suggests that you want this to be that sounds slightly odd to as unless got a of these events quite likely to only ever see them execute on different making the whole sharing business if you really do want that sort of suggest just using an instance variable in the class for exactly the reason described in the paragraph above

you want to create a manual link to an article in an type menu item or a link within an you must start the url with not an absolute or it will break compatibility with search engine friendly with sef you can just go to the of your site and copy the url from the menu item you want to link with sef you only see the routed version of the which of course would break if sef were turned integrated editors using usually offer a button to let you find and link to a particular they highlight a menu item or use that menu if you want the link to use a particular menu item you probably you have to manually look up the menu id and add at the end of the to add insult with its strange initial is case even the url in the source menu detail page not include the menu item only the article have clients who really get and why should how can i tell a tech client to find the right url to link to a menu are there any extensions that help with i just wanted to share that i know about the alias menu item type when i wrote you should use that instead of if you want your new menu item to highlight a certain other menu useful for making custom breadcrumb or sidebar menu the problem still holds for links within links with sef on	
you want to do in a unit test is make sure that the method does the job that it is supposed to if the method uses dependencies to accomplish you would mock those dependencies out and make sure that your method calls the methods on the objects it depends on with the appropriate this way you test your code in of the benefits to this is that it will drive the design of your code in a better in order to use for you naturally gravitate towards more decoupled code using dependency this gives you the ability to easily substitute your mock objects for the actual objects that your class depends you also end up implementing which are more naturally both of these things are good design patterns and will improve your order to test your particular for you might have your class depend on a factory to create connections to the database and a builder to construct parameterized sql commands that are executed via the pass these mocked versions of these objects to your class and ensure that the correct methods to set up the connection and build the correct execute and tear down the connection were or you inject an already open connection and simply build the command and invoke the point is your class is built against an interface or set of interfaces and you use mocking to supply objects that implement those interfaces and can record invocations and supply correct return values to the methods that you expect to use from the

you want to provide multiple values to a one clean way to do this is to have separate one for each instead of trying to pass them all in one another clean way to do this is to create a new class that combines all these values into one and expose a single property of that for class private as private as private as public property destination as return end end end public property due as return end end end public property expected as return end end end i think necessary to implement property procedures instead of directly exposing the internal field values in order for the properties to show up in a property if you have this then you can create a property of type traindetails on your control that will encapsulate all these properties in one i think they will be editable in the property grid as a single property with an expandable next to it to edit the individual
