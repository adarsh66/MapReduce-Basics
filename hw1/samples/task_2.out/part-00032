a ton more work than you need to just need to write a class that derives from iaudiosessionnotifications you need to actually write a whole com object and register should also use the econsole role instead of the emultimedia it effectively matter you have only one audio but more destructor for the customaudionotification class should be private that way you prevent accidental so new also assuming that initialized com before your code kevin sent me his application and there are a couple of other issues with his application that are more fundamental working to get the documentation for the apis improve to prevent any confusion in the first is that his application retrieved the current list of this is one of the really subtle things about the session enumeration in order to prevent a race condition that can occur when a session notification arrives while the application using the session apis is starting the session enumeration api discards new session notifications until the application has first retrieved the list of existing expected usage pattern activates a session registers for session retrieves the current list of sessions for the endpoint and stores the session control objects into a list forget to addref the a new session is the application takes a reference to the newly created session control object and inserts it into the list if not already note that the session control object passed into the notification will be destroyed when the session notification returns if you call getsessionenumerator at this point it will probably not hold the newly created session it all depends on application manages the lifetime of the session based on its own criteria as long as the application has a reference to the session control the session control object will be there is no expiration mechanism for audio session control the session apis require that the mta be initialized this is unfortunate but because we create com objects implement on a worker thread the api requires that the mta be created before the notification is

advice for your issues is general because i do not know the specifics of the platform you are working your i see two distinct web presentation layer be it will require custom spacing and even custom do not fool yourself that this will not be this is one of the biggest mistakes people make initially when internationalizing web you will need another style for the if you are using a template approach you can put most of your language content right in the the description of your it sounds like you will also need to handle localized error there is two approaches two you can have a language file where you localize when the error is thrown using a resource file another approach is to have your error messages use a common identifier and parameters and have another layer catch the message and localize i myself prefer the former solution since it is remember that if you are writing your error messages to a log that the error messages are in a language that the developers can likewise for errors displayed to users in the you will want some way for the users to identify the errors to the developers who do not speak the this could be done by using numbers i prefer using short keys like

all boils down to what responsibilities do you wish to assign to the client and the implementer of the defensive programming you force the implementer to check for error conditions which can be costy or even impossible in some imagine a contract specified by the binarysearch for example your input array has to be you detect this while running the you have to do a manual check for it which will actually bump the execution time an order of to back my opinion up is the signature of the method from the point is people and frameworks now tend to implement exception translation mechanisms which is used mainly to translate checked exceptions to runtime exceptions that will just pop up if something wrong this way the client and implementer of the contract has less to worry about while dealing with each this is my personal opinion backed only with what limited experience i love to hear more about this

am starting to explore linq to objects but want to know how application design can best accommodate linq to an example an application displays female employees only and the employee table in the database contains data for both male and female the application builds a sql statement to retrieve only the female employees from the database and places them into an object which is then passed around the application for display get the greatest leverage from linq to i assume you would first have to obtain all the data for employees and then apply linq to filter the object to only display the female the benefit is that you can continue to query the employees without touching the database is a basic example but the point i am trying to make is where does the line between benefit and efficient execution time if the employee table has can see the benefit of linq but in my i am convinced that you first need to put all the data into an object from which you can then use linq to all the data may be too costly to make it worthwhile when i can just query the database again each time i need a different subset of to objects philosophy of

am trying to become a good programming citizen through learning more about dependency injection ioc and other for this i have a project where i am trying to make the right choices and design everything in the whatever that might moq and mvc help with testability and getting the app the i have a question about how to design an entity base class for the objects that my application consists i have a simple class library which the web app is built on top this library exposes a irepository and the default implementation one that the app uses under the covers datacontext is not exposed to the web and simply contains ways to fetch these the repository basically looks like this interface where t t where t default implementation uses the method on the datacontext to provide the correct this requires that the base class has some it is easy enough to get my objects to inherit from it by creating a partial class of the same name as the mapped object that gives but what is the way to do the interface above has a function for getting an entity by id all the different kinds of classes that derives from entity does indeed have an field of type int from the primary key of their respective but how can i specify this in a way that lets me implement irepository like class concreterepository private somedatacontext db new public where t return public t where t return am doing this from memory on a pc so forgive any you hopefully get my trick here is of course that for this to it has to be known for sure that entity promises that everyone that derives from it has an id i can make an abstract or a normal field that is by the id field that sticks in the generated this all feels kind of like a and even gives compiler really be interface and i should try to make the id field be defined in a way that will this would also make it easy to specify other interfaces that need to should be an abstract base class with an abstract id and should it also implement needed interfaces in an abstract way for others to know well enough to see an elegant solution to so i would love to hear from more experienced system designers with some base class experience weigh in on april see i left out something important my irepository has two concrete implementations one that is the one using linq to the other one is a inmemoryrepository that just uses a list for which is used for unit testing two solutions added will both work for one of these not for the so if i would need a way to define that everything that inherits from entity will have the and that this will work with the linq to sql datacontext without base class design in for repository

an exception there will be time overhead which depends on how you implement your exception being the severity of an event that should cause an exception will take just as much time to handle using any other why not use the highly supported language based method of dealing with such gnu compiler uses the model by default there is no time overhead when exceptions information about code and the offsets of local objects can be computed once at compile such information can be kept in a single place associated with each but not in each you essentially remove exception overhead from each ari and thus avoid the extra time to push them onto the this approach is called the model of exception and the optimized storage mentioned earlier is known as the shadow bruce thinking in volume size complexity overhead easily quantifiable but eckel states an average of 5 and 15 this will depend on the size of your exception handling code in ratio to the size of your application if your program is small then exceptions will be a large part of the if you are using a model than exceptions will take more space to remove the time so if you care about space and not time than use is that most embedded systems have plenty of memory to the extent that if your system has a compiler you have enough space to include the computer that my project uses has several gb of secondary 512 mb of main hence no space problem for exceptions our micorcontrollers are programmed in my heuristic is there is a mainstream compiler for use otherwise use

and fair enough to say my response warrants a little more choose mvc for the following have worked in rails and found it highly asp mvc has borrowed so much from rails that it feels like a direct port in some ways a good thing in my is but i the microsoft approach to ajax the product name is these if going to do you need to understand the html and the frameworks that hide that from you are hurting you more than they are helping you has taken over the world it seems in terms of javascript aspmvc is with i want to learn so great alignment whole model is a neat but it is more complicated than it appears on the for look around on so for questions about how a usercontrol can find its highest level containing control and so the control hierarchy abstraction has leaks in grids are great if they do what you want out of the but very very hard to customize them to do something they made to and the best grid controls on the market ones that are highly are overly complicated maybe that shows us that we should drop back down to html and let loops in our views do that kind of thing for believe i can build beautiful apps in aspmvc much faster than in got some years of under my look at stackoverflow built quickly on aspmvc with and scalable and a joy to use and completely open it is ok to read the source blog about and even modify then redistribute

answer is because it provides a way to launch custom then generate build but not very because you then lose all possibilities to use build in which you can to always compile files with some precise skip custom build for a particular file in a particular project configuration visualize this is no way at least i have found to it the only way i have found is to have the custom build tool return a number when files have been with a message to the user explaining that it is an error and inviting him to launch build the next custom build tool is launched again but the tool i use is pretty but modifies no new and build process goes using valid the approach described above does not work with which seems to ignore project build	
answer is but nothing crazy about just plain old the really crazy code you asked in case you were select from for btype in as	
answer is yes and it all depends on the purpose of the method for these methods are simply utility methods then it makes perfect sense to make them the methods represent some sort of business logic of your application a web then you may want to make them as flexible as in this they would become a simple pojo as instance this has the not so obvious benefit that they can be converted to spring transactional or even ejb3 session beans with very little it also makes the methods easier to you can also create interfaces for this bean and add additional aspects to it the way you

answers address the way the reference count is stored is stored in a shared memory for all that hold the same native but most elude the problem of easiest way of leaking memory with reference counted pointers is creating as an a doubly linked list where all the pointers are with at least two elements is guaranteed not to be even if external pointers are the internal pointers will still and the reference count will not reach that at with the most easiest solution to the cycle problem is mixing counted with weak pointers that do not share the ownership of the pointers will share both the resource and the additional when you use weak the reference count is there is a shared pointer reference count and a weak pointer reference the resource is released whenever the shared pointer count reaches but the information is left alive until the last weak pointer is the doubly linked the external reference is held in a while the internal links are just whenever there are no external references the elements of the list are deleting the weak at the end all weak references have been deleted and the last weak pointer to each resources frees the is less confusing than the above text try again	
answers that talk about using arp to find the dns server are generally ip address resolution for ip addresses is done using and not the responsibility to answer such an arp routing is done by the machine knowing which ip addresses are on the local subnets to which it is if the requested ip address is not then the client machine refers to its routing table to find out which gateway to send the packet in most circumstances the packet sent out will be an arp request to find the mac address of the default if not already in the arp then can it send the dns query via the in this case the packet is sent with the dns ip address in the ip destination but with the mac address on the ethernet

appears to me that you have two totally one for value1 and one for when you use the value1 key to the records necessarily returned in order of so they have to be this is still better than a full table scan since only sorting the records that satisfy your think this is possible in a composite key on would solve table id not null value1 unsigned not null default value2 not null default primary key key value1 key value1and2 default the equivalent assuming the correct syntax in mysql for a composite all databases i know i have to admit mysql one of that would cause the db engine to select the value1and2 key for retrieving the rows and they would already be sorted in so need a file can still keep the value2 key if you need

approach to work around this is to use the scriptignore attribute and create a partial class for the object in up the entitystate properties and adding a scriptignore attribute to partial class public new entitykey public new entitystate the person class is serialized via it will ignore those this would not be practical because ef uses the state info to keep track of objects and this would wreak there were a way to dynamically add it would eliminate the need to override those properties just to add a since there is no way to dynamically add this solution may not be that	
are a couple of things you can do on the iphone wrt to first is a audio manipulation library that is supported on the you can find a faq for it you can use one of the services available to you on the iphone as part of the core audio you can get a list of the services available to both iphone and mac os x core audio developers audio what i can it look like there are any canned audio so where you have transitions available for you in core i think you have higher level effects available to you out of the box in that openal is and you should be able to find plenty of sample effects that are part of the openal sdk or as part of other public	
are a few possibilities you only need a few of the parameters each the parameter suggested elsewhere in this answer is a nice you always need all of the i would suggest that the smell is coming from broken semantic model of the data required to calculate a matter how you dress up a call to a method that takes eight the fact that eight supposedly unrelated pieces of information are required to calculate something will always a step the eight separate arguments all or can you compose intermediate objects that reflect the reality of the situation a little invoice something the cost method be split into smaller methods that calculate part of the cost based on fewer and the total cost produced from adding up the component

are actually quite a few alternative the reason for so many versions is partly because while ruby itself has a lot of mri is often considered to be not quite as nice as the language it is a list of all the other ruby implementations i know for its speed advantage as great now that ruby is but still a big player for its integration with in for for making native mac os x currently based on ruby but going to release a new virtual machine for the next which looks to offer a major speed boost and will hopefully be portable to other llvm target very much in for web it will probably be a commercial is a reimplementation meant as an alternative to mri with a much cleaner doubt blue ruby will have much of an impact on the general software development it will probably be nice for sap programmers and allow them to cast a wider net for potential hires since ruby is somewhat more popular than of the current ruby implementations are compiled to contrary to as of ruby mri itself includes a bytecode though the ability to save the compiled bytecode to disk disappeared somewhere in the process of merging the yarv virtual jruby is compiled into java i have a lot of details on but it seems safe to say it will take that road as

are defining the bar two things are there is no parametric type involved in that the foo and t members have a single say that is fixed for the if passed a foo that you expect to assign to it must be a if this is all then not part of the public interface everything has a specific not sure what you mean by as there are no free type if you mean universally how do you reconcile the fact that bar has no parametric so must have been given a concrete type for each of there is a parametric type involved in it may not be obviously in the public but perhaps you pass in a so you want to have a bar class be instantiated with more than a single as this is in the public and you need to make bar parametric in t with this gives you some form of universal quantification for the all types this definition is	
are developing a skinned app with various rounded edges on most of its i am using window regions to define but nearly everyone objects to the jagged aliasing this because pixels can only be either fully opaque or fully come up with a solution to this using layered but we want to make sure this will run hopefully run on a variety of and i want to see if anyone has any better or ways to optimize what i know layered windows requires win2000 or and that is as that is already a requirement for other from some basic tests it looks ok on but no guarantee what i i have a call it with controls and text and whatever comprises that i have window b as a child of window except it has the style instead of so it can position itself outside region and is drawn on top of window b also has the and on i call with the flag and a source dc with a 32bit bitmap with an alpha to get it to draw with bitmap used in the source dc for window b is pretty much just the pixels around the border of the window that i want to blend smoothly from the background into full i would skip the whole two window approach and just use a single layered except that when using it is drawn from a buffer kept in in lieu of the typical messages and all and trying to get interactive child controls child to work well with that sounds like a remarkable hassle probably even work for basically window a with all the child controls and with window b floating directly on top of drawing a nice smooth i respond to messages and so on by moving window b along with and i have window b disabled so it can never get focus or input already go since parts of it that are of zero such as the majority of its inner already are excluded from what the pieces look to show what i mean a little with cyan used to mask fully transparent with an alpha channel pictured of a that would blend the pixels into it but i be certain really the best way to do i have two this sound or is there anything glaringly terrible about it currently it seems like using an buffer the size of the window can be up to even though very few pixels of it have any opacity data would it be worth the overhead and additional complexity of cutting it up into separate border pieces and compositing them layered windows to create smooth window

are useful when you want to mock an interaction between an object and one of its however there is less value in an interface for an object which has internal say i have a service which talks to a repository in order to extract some domain object in order to manipulate it in some is definite design value in extracting an interface from the my concrete implementation of the repository may well be strongly linked to nhibernate or by linking my service to the interface i get a clean separation from this implementation it just so happens that i can also write super fast standalone unit tests for my service now that i can hand it a mock the domain object which came back from the repository and which my service acts there is less when i write test for my i will want to use a real domain object and check its after the call to i want to check that something was added to the domain i can test this by simple inspection of the state of the domain when i test my domain object in i need interfaces as i am only going to perform operations on the object and quiz it on its internal is it valid for my sheep to eat grass if it is the first we are interested in based interfaces help because we want to intercept the calls passing between the object under test and its collaborators with in the second case we are interested in based interfaces help try to be conscious of whether you are testing state or interactions and let that influence your interface or no interface that you have a copy of resharper it is extremely cheap to extract an interface it is also cheap to delete the interface and revert to a simpler class hierarchy if you decide that you need that interface after my advice would be to start without interfaces and extract them on demand when you find that you want to mock the you bring ioc into the then i would tend to extract more interfaces but try to keep a lid on how many classes you shove into your ioc in you want to keep these restricted to largely stateless service

benefit of that notation in was to make it easier to see what a type was without having to go search for the these styles appeared before the arrival of intellisense and to we often had to go on a goose chase looking for the declaration in who knows how many header on a large project this could be a significant annoyance which was bad enough when looking at c source but even worse when doing forensics using mixed code and a raw call faced with these using and all the other hungarian rules starts to make some sense even with the maintenance overhead because of how much time it would save just in looking up a type when looking at unfamiliar now of course we have intellisense and to so the main time saving motivation of that naming convention is no longer i think much point in doing that any and i generally try to go with the library guidelines just to be consistent and possibly gain a little bit more tool

code because using locking without making the field unfortunately have a volatile so you apply the normal just acquire the lock every time or use static initialization to initialize when the type is singleton for a general discussion of this with regards to singletons i know this a but the page gives but it should be fairly easy to i generally recommend making lock variables you really want to be changing the value general static properties okay to lock on a static variable initialize it like you are try to write or code unless you know what i regard myself as reasonably knowledgeable about and i still try using locking initialization is a few caveats if you have complex initializers which end up referencing each so a good time to do initialization like this then you really need a you need to make the type a just write function to initialize the list and return then use that function in the initializer for the this has to be declared as the initializer will execute in textual order just create the array inside buildregexes and have it as a field at unless you need the array that would be a better shared readonly as string shared readonly as shared readonly property as return end shared function as dim list new for each exp as string in or or return

compilers courses usually focus on how the code is analyzed and translated into machine very but not more important to understand what is this machine code that is generated by the compiler so that you understand how a computer works and what is the cost of each language rather say that you should know an assembly language mean a limited subset of assembly language for one to understand how a computer works and the latter is definitely required for a competent programmer so that he understands what segmenation fault when to optimize and when not and other similar

department is working on a project that requires us to heavily communicate with another whose software ours has to interact this resulted in a 4 hour conference call where the whole team had to with very few results and no progress in the actual coding at to it was a complete waste of except for maybe 15 minutes where we discussed a problem i am facing in my task reaching any consensus on how to softwares have to but are nominally different since both teams are from different nobody is nominally in charge of both of so we have to resolve all differences between with interdepartmental politics shining in all their am looking for a way to reduce the time spent procrastinating in those any management solution someone who is in charge of the who takes is a no since we are all i think that a software solution for communicating with the other devs would be easy to am specifically looking for something the existing the interface requirements by the opposite me establish relations between those two in a fulfills requirement me mark an interface as tested buggy a report which requirements have no interface to fulfill a report which requirements have not been implemented yet you know of any tools that could provide i would prefer web based and free software in because this is only my personal and there is no budget know that stephan eggermont is we are having behaviour that is something that i am unable to change i hence my idea to fix the symptom instead of the solution for communication between two

do you do sit here and trying to make things simpler for myself and but i seem to decide what way would be the the issue is with a collection of something from a data and then start filtering out on a whole bunch of different if then those or perhaps those unless that is not this but that and between those and over the hill except if nothing then up and maybe not that but i basically need to build up trees like x x x x x represents and the branches represents because of the alternative paths i use all the way and using things like and have a to managed to use it in a working way in other words i have to build up have created extension methods for adding those together with and of from i have started to create a predicate builder class to make things even a bit more plan is to create chains of and then them kind i just decide if these are good ideas or i think the road i have started down probably can end up with an ok for me when i am coding these but i am curious to know how others are solving these which i would think may be pretty at least in applications that have to filter and crunch data in all kinds of weird ways and then display them to the building up

easiest way to do this is probably by storing the object in the viewstate when the page loads the first having the user manipulate and then saving it back to the database when the user wants to save one of the problems with this approach is that if multiple users edit the same item at the same you could end up with a situation where data is user a loads page and starts making user b loads page and starts making user a presses changes are saved to user b presses changes are saved to overwriting user could get around this by using a timestamp to save the date and time of the last and comparing it to the one in the viewstate before committing the you could lock the item when someone begins editing stopping two people from making changes at the same though this solution is probably less reliable what happens if the user browses away from the page while

got a couple of really old msdos based paint they work on palette indexed image they have a number of spectacular shape drawing brushes and effects that simply do not exist in any modern paint particularly not whilst staying within the of a low color palette indexed i would like to reproduce many of these wonderful tools in a modern to perhaps make them more accessible to myself and the general public without having to boot up an emulator like but i have a a lot of these brushes and tools and things have obvious whose implementation should be fairly but with other their principles of operation are not so i would be stuck determining a correct or faithful algorithm to implement you were what approach would you are there readily available that can handle old programs like or would you take some different such as methodically testing the algorithms on different inputs to sort of infer the underlying some combination of different in the case of one line of these the original author of these programs is and is now a rabid open source should i just try to contact them directly and not particularly experienced with reverse so at a loss at where to start on it seems that and ye shall really have a look at for the source code for the program that got the source deluxe paint would be nice too but dan silva seems to have vanished off the face of the engineering old paint	
got a great tip that setting the address attribute on the endpoint to the url you wish to display in the wsdl and then add a listenuri attribute to the endpoint with the actual uri to listen on would do the url in the test page does not get affected it will still show the address specified in the but within the wsdl the correct uri will be set one specified in the though when i tried this shortly after i posted the i could not get it to work within only when self hosting in a console checking myself today i found that it does indeed so now not sure why it work for me we have done in the mean time is buid a simple custom behaviour that changed the service description putting the address required in the wsdl from obviously if built in support for that much so i will hopfully get some time next week to look into this

got an answer via sql server portion here from aaron key here is that all report model queries are centered around a and each row at the detail level in your report represents a row in this base you may note that in your there is no entity which corresponds to charge for an order or just the order if it has no you need to explicitly create this entity in the based on a named query in the this named query can just select the keys from the ord table and the charge table with a left outer join between the you then create relationships from these keys to the ord and charge and update the model on model root node and you start with details from ord and navigate through the new role to charge and select additional report builder will choose the entity as the entity of the are considering functionality for a future release to allow creating these types of queries directly in report builder without requiring the model designer to explicitly create the left outer join

i agree that this is bad in you could use the new closure syntax with the magic word to use operators as functions if we want to supply a way of doing this you i can think of using mixed with the you use a regex pattern to get convert the functions into compatible and put themin a private than you use the method to fetch working on a small here is the i got the inspiration from a class i saw a few weeks ago that used closures to implement supplies an interface with which you can load external functions into an existing the functions supplied to this class will recive the classes referance as a first and as a second argument they will recive an array of supplied arieh glazer mit like array holder of genarated protected loads functions for an external file into the a the file must not contain php string a public function for public function if else throw new such method the source cannot have any php functions will always be we can only mimic what i did was to pass as a 1st argument and the second is the array of arguments is a 4th you will not be able to access members and methods from within the example for a source the object has a member called echo was a fun exercise for but a bad practice all in all

implementation string objects have a final char when you create a new string by calling no new char array is the new instance uses the of the original this is the case in line 2 and the new string objects will use the char array of constructor creates a new char array in case of the string length being less than the total length of the char array so the string created in line 4 will use a new char should have a look at the of the constructor public really	
implemented my own memory manager which uses buddy memory allocation and block sizes of powers of satisfied it is correct and has doesnt coalesses free blocks and can do a the a great first once you have a working custom memory allocator you can of course do problem as expected there is quite a bit of of 2 and external not an expert in this field and although i find it facinating still a i wonder if there is any other implementations that have done the same or similar surely i cant be the only power of two is a generic note that this may not be the best simply because your allocation pattern may not follow the same geometric in such a case it is best to test as much as you can and see what block sizes are getting allocated the most and optimize would also like to suggest this a wonderful article by andrei alexandrescu and emery berger on the topic of memory memory and the work in hoard memory possible go through the references mentioned at the end of that they may just as well provide additional

in mind that i speak put the most important differentiating factor collection is the single most important factor in differentiating between these c and can be used with it is a afterthought and cannot be made to work as well best known is it has to be which means that it cannot collect all unused is designed from the ground up to work on a gc with standard libraries also designed that it makes an absolutely fundamental difference to developer productivity that has to be experienced to be is a belief widespread among users that gc equates with but this is folklore the boehm collector on performs much better than most people expect it the typical fear is of where the program stops so the gc can do some but in reality these long pauses happen with because they run on top of a virtual memory which occasionally interrupts to move data between physical memory and is also widespread belief that gc can be replaced with but it the irony is that in a is slower than a are environments that are so frugal that gc practical but these are increasingly cell phones typically have the gc that typically runs on appears to be adopting about 18 months ago gone through several phases of pure performance tuning with a and the gc is so efficient that it is practically invisible during the operation of the is not a it solve all programming it only really cleans up memory if allocating very large memory blocks then you will still need to take some and it is still possible to have what amounts to a memory leak in a sufficiently complex program and the effect of gc on productivity makes it a pretty close approximation to a is founded on the notion of undefined that the language specification defines the outcome of certain narrowly defined usages of language and describes all other usages as causing meaning in principle that the operation could have any outcome at all practice this means bugs involving apparently corruption of everything about touches on undefined even very nice forthcoming features like lambda expressions can easily be used as convenient way to corrupt the stack a local by allow the lambda instance to outlive the is founded on the principle that all possible operations should have defined the worst that can happen is an exception is this completely changes the experience of software unsafe which has pointers and therefore undefined but that is strongly discouraged for general use think of it as analogous to embedded assembly terms of has to be singled especially if we consider the standardized new does absolutely everything it can to make itself short of assuming and as a result it has an awesome learning the language designers excuse much of this by saying features are only for library not ordinary but to be truly effective in any you need to build your code as reusable so you the positive is so like a playground for i can assure you that you would have a lot of fun learning how it all fits but i seriously recommend it as a basis for productive new work the wasted on mainstream keeps the language simple in the sense of compiler is easy to but this makes the coding techniques more that not all new language features equate with added some language features are described as because they are shorthand that the compiler expands for this is a good way to think of a great deal of the enhancements to over recent the language standard even specifies some features by giving the translation to statement expands into one it was possible to think of templates in the same but since become so powerful that they are now form the basis of a whole separate dimension of the with its own user communities and strangest thing about c and is that they have a standard interchangeable form of integrating someone code into your project is always a little with obscure decisions to be made about how be linking to the standard library is extremely basic has a complete set of data structures and a way of representing strings but still is there a standard way of finding a list of files in a is there standard library support for parsing or generating what about accessing be writing a web site are you you have to go hunting further for try but does it use to represent of course do all these libraries have their own bizarre customs for naming classes and you situation in be more the fundamentals were in place from the so everything beautifully because the fundamentals are supplied by the there is not all generics should have been in place from the start but which does leave a visible scar on some older but it is usually trivial to fix this also a number of popular libraries are ported from which as good a fit as it first methods with local variable and c are practically the last remaining mainstream languages to lack and libraries can be designed and used much more neatly with them than without is one reason why ported java libraries sometimes seem clunky to a amusing thing about is that its standard library was designed as if closures were available in the language then ten years went and now finally being they will have a huge impact as noted they leak underfined and javascript are the most widely used languages in which closures are major difference between those languages being that is statically typed while javascript is dynamically put this last only because it appear to differentiate these languages as much as you might all these languages can run on multiple oses and machine c is the most then and finally can be used on most major platforms thanks to an open source implementation called experience of porting programs between windows and various unix flavours was never tried porting anything very complex in to so i comment on

in performance of the code itself as has been answered by performance in maintaining the say most programmers expect the variables to be defined at the top of the simple example like you provided and it but a complex function with variable declarations interspersed in the code makes it feel thus slowing down the time to read and grok the thus increasing the time it takes to is also the possible problem with declaring a variable in a loop and not intending thus the variable gets reset with each loop performance of the code itself is often not as important as performance in maintaining the

is how to do this properly using the idea is turn a decently marked up html form into nicer color and size swatch buttons for users that have benefits of this method are you can easily or components and have the form still it will work for users that hvae and if it will be accessible via keyboard and screen it also requires no extra code on and will be a lot easier to use with a form of the work is done with css with only minimal javascript to add the finishing working example example can be found it includes both color and size i have only included the colors here as there is only a slight difference in the css between the markup the form here are the you may obviously want to add like a wrapper around the whole or use other so may seem a lot for but there are several things going on the whole container is flagged as so everything within can be targeted appropriately with css i add a class corresponding to the and a class on each echoing the value to allow css to add appropriate styles the rest is pretty much your standard form javascript is very all we do is detect which radio input is currently selected and flag the container with a thus allowing css to highlight it notify css that js is for every radio redo every function refresh this trigger initial this of triggering click to enforce the initial run may be unsafe if you have click handlers higher i use this method for is where the real magic the idea is that we can tuck the input controls out of view and style the labels as color so long as the attributes on the labels correctly point to on the inputs then clicking the labels will suffice to select the control need to target things only within so that users that have javascript but still have css will see the radio input some sort of class could alternatively be added on the wrapper to get the same thing float the buttons and give them a more attributes are lined up horizontally li border 1px solid margin 0 4px 0 padding float overflow position put and on each li so we can shift the input element out of this will keep it but we just no longer have to look at if remove inputs from sight input position left up is turning the labels into if turn color labels into buttons label cursor display height width hide text color buttons in color allowed even if no js label background label background label background set some styles for our highlighted selected if current selected highlight border 2px solid padding the select if you want to add more effects is demonstrated elsewhere on

is my current have a web page containing a couple scrollable each of those divs contains a number of i am using yui to display popup menus of actions that can be performed on each each object has its own menu associated with it that is constructed and displayed the popup menus can be large and can overlap the bounds of the scrollable what i believe are issues with focus menus must be when i hover the mouse over an action that lies on top of an edge of the scrollable the div automatically moving the content but leaving the menu trying to move the menu dynamically when this happens is not something i want to do as i believe it would provide a poor user i need to prevent this focussed menu from scrolling the my idea for providing the best user interface is to prevent these inner divs from scrolling when a menu is this leaves the menu positioned in the optimal location to show the user which item is being acted if the user wants to scroll the they can click to close the menu and then scroll can i do i need a solution that works across the major first thought was to listen to the event for that particular there does not seem to be an easy way from there to just prevent the scrolling from for my javascript event code appears to execute after the actual scrolling has i thought that since my code is being run after the object has i could just reset and sure this appears to though i am worried that on slow browsers the user will see the content inside the div it would be really nice if the amount the element scrolls is part of the event is it stuck in there looking for an alternative to having to store the scrolltop and scrollleft variables for this element and then using them while the scrolling is temporarily is the best way to solve this entire can i temporarily prevent a scrollable div from

is the beginning of another possible solution in perl works as is but could probably be made more sophisticated if it sounds as if all you are concerned about is removing duplicates across the corpus and really care if the last part of one article is in the file for the next one as long as it duplicated if this solution will strip out the duplicate lines leaving only one copy of any given line in the set of files as a can either just run the file in the directory containing the text files with no argument or alternately specify a file name containing the list of files you want to process in the order you want them i recommend the latter as your file names least in the sample files you do not naturally list out in order when using simple commands like on the command line or in the perl thus it necessarily compare the correct files to one another as it just runs down the list or generated by the glob if you specify the you can guarantee that they will be processed in the correct order and it take that long to set it up script simply opens two files and makes note of the first three lines of the second it then opens a new output file file name for the first file and writes out all the lines from the first file into the new output file until it finds the first three lines of the second there is an off chance that there are not three lines from the second file in the last one but in all the files i spot checked that seemed to be the case because of the journal name header and page one line definitely enough as the journal title was often the first line and that would cut things off should also note that the last file in your list of files entered will not be processed have a new file created based off of as it will not be changed by this the open close else glob if ne print open my close my if my my open my close my open my my while 1 and if else print out close added a check for parenthesis in the first line that goes into the regex check for duplicity later on and if found escapes them so that they mess up the duplicity

jeffamaphone but i should add that any time that state changes you will have to make sure to run that same the easiest way to insure this happens is by binding the property to the state object that you are interested that any change made to the object is immediately reflected in the blog me get started with data because i love	
job is to design a project plan class library which supports the tracking of tasks to how ms project this class library has a object object has a and among a object can have one parent and several children the and properties of a which has children a depend on those properties of its immediate the parent is the earliest of its the parent is the latest of its the parent is the sum of its it is invalid to change these properties on a which has would you handle the use case where the or enddate are changed on a task which has a properties are a reflection of its so any changes to children may require the properties to be adjusted to reflect the changes option is to have an event for when each property a parent would listen for these events on its immediate children and make appropriate changes to its own properties when those events is this a good or is there a better how would do a basic idea of what a object might look class private mchildren as private menddate as datetime public property as return menddate end value as menddate to do end end private mestimatedhours as double public property as double return mestimatedhours end value as mestimatedhours to do end end private mstartdate as datetime public property as return mstartdate end value as mstartdate to do end end object hierarchy to event or not to

just thought add my two cents to the i am currently developing daily in i was hired here new england about years ago as a web with little programming experience a former i was a web i knew css and html like the back of my but only some very limited in i even heard of the lasso programming language before i started they were pretty confident that pick it up as skeptical as i they were the lasso syntax is quick and easy to once you wrap your head around the syntax and the the rest falls into place in a short time i was able to build some really database web far as clearly is nowhere near the size of that of php or but what found is that developers are die hard fans of the language and thus are very active and i find a small devoted community more easily approachable and less most of the really juicy lasso conversations take place on oh i went to the lasso developers conference last year and was blown away by the dedication of the lassosoft company and the developer to mention all of the exciting stuff coming up in lasso later this downsides to first and no two ways about it if just looking to build something for demo or for a very small you might be able to get away with the lack of mature hosting take a look at the vast amount of stuff you can get in any random php hosting plan and compare that to anything you can find for pretty rough out there guys are not much to look but are pretty guess that most lasso users are hosting their own solutions you decide to keep going with here a few resources that found to be a puplic exchange for lasso custom of the worth a lasso environment for eclipse as well as a support in coda i enthusiastically mean for this to be so be happy to answer some specifics for good luck with whatever direction you choose to go

just want the just to be able to upload or and then simple approach is just to test that the file ends in or before storing it on the this should be part of a much more validation of what the filename is allowed to contain before you let a filename anywhere near the the rules about what can go in a filename are complex on some platforms usually best to create your own filename independently with a name and any case there is no guarantee that the browser will send you a file with a usable name at and even if it does there is no guarantee that name will have or at the even if it is a text or csv platforms simply do not use extensions for file you can try to sniff the contents of the file to see what type it might this is highly for be plain or a variety of other better to give the user an explicit control to say what file type uploading use one file upload field per where it gets really say accepted the upload and stored it as and the web server is correctly serving it as the what do you think the browser interprets it plain you should be so problem is that browsers trust your and instead sniff the contents of the file to see if it looks like something serve the above snippet as plain and ie will happily treat it as this can be a huge because html can include scripts that will take over the access to the site this point you might be tempted to sniff the file on the for example using the to check it contain but this is doomed to the command does not sniff for all the same html tags as ie and other browsers sniff differently quite easy to prepare a file that will claim is not but that ie will nevertheless treat as if it is approaches such as will give you only a false sense of this is a convenience tool for loose guessing of filetypes and an effective security this point your last desperate possibilities are things all files from a separate so that a script injection attack purloin the credentials of your main all files through a cgi adding the header so that browsers attempt to display them accepting uploads from trusted

languages might permit but neither community condones the monkeypatching condoned in either but you hear about it more often in ruby because the form of open class it uses makes it very easy to monkeypatch a class and because of more acceptable in the ruby but still frowned monkeypatching simply as prevalent or as easy in which is why you hear the same arguments against it in that python does nothing that ruby do to prevent the reason you about it more often in ruby is that this in def puts def puts give you a class that contains two and whereas this in def print def print leave you with a class that only contains the method as redefinition of a class clobbers the previous definition to monkeypatch in you actually have to write def print print is harder than the ruby that alone makes ruby code much easier to monkeypatch than python

makes no sense to do this on an primary key as even if it was trivial to without mass updates in related tables you affect your data to do so you would likely need to drop the index and primary key constraint from the column which point your application may flake renumber all later renumber all related then the primary key constraint and you really must have some form of linear identifier which always starts at 0 may then indicate a problem with the software then you can have a secondary id column in addition to the primary which you then update to shuffle higher values down a rung with a statement such secondaryid secondaryid secondaryid secondaryid from table where primaryid to from primaryid to strongly discourage such a practice if your ids are values because of deleted the software should test for existence of these values rather than just wigging	
making this but it should work a source and destination simply a between the two and move the vehicle along that the vehicle moves on the more granular graphic you can determine which square the unit is in simple coordinate mapping for important a unit be in a single then when the unit it can coast to the next square it can be fully contained it if already left square it continues moving to b even tho the vehicle is the heading between the two points to determine the direction of the your vehicle only has 8 then you can point them at the next incremental square destination rather than the final that will look ok for slow moving but be kind of funny for fast to this drawing to help calculate the none of this has anything to do with path of

martin gives you a good dissection and explanation of what went wrong with your specific but address the general question should you use the read answer to that is when you want to read successive lines from some file possibly the standard output of some previous sequence of commands in a possibly splitting the lines into several separate the splitting is done using the current value of which normally means on blanks and tabs count in this they separate if there are multiple variables in the read then the first word goes into the first the second into the and the residue of the line into the last if only one the whole line goes into that are many this is one of the simpler scripts i have that uses the split jleffler exp create basic set of with log mode with buffered with buffered read dbs if then else sqlcmd database resource to command with a has its output sent to a so the output goes into the read dbs the first word goes into and is the name of the database i want to the remainder of the line is placed into the body of the loop deals with unlogged databases and do not then run a program separate from the microsoft of the same been around since about to create a database and populate it with some standard tables and data a simulation of the oracle and a set of tables related to the of scripts that use the command are bigger but generally read lines containing one or more file names and some other attributes of and then apply an appropriate transform to the files using the file grep sed xargs wgrep version while read read x read x while read file type link owner group read x while read file type link owner group while read size while read read dist read dbs read msdfile read gfile sfile version read name type read name type is my command line i ran this in my is a variant of grep that only matches entire words avoid words like this gives some indication of how used x lines are for an interactive script that reads a response from standard but exits if the command gets eof if standard input comes from

method would have advantages in extending orders with further as well as instrumenting changes but not recommend the is about collecting behaviours specific to distinct states in separate not about how to present stateful interfaces to other think about the business events which come naturally shipping invoice and design an explicit interface around exactly how you design the interface depends on how your application logic is and how it is used from other the classic answer is to define abstract methods for each business event if using you might decide to go with incoming and outgoing events from your order or you could try try some mixture or combination the main point is that a interface very and is likely to lead to a clumsy implementation methods in each of your orderstate a method internal to your classes from each of your specific methods or could be ok if you have a lot of code around the different state but i expose that as an external the drawback is that you may get some overlap between the methods of your internal iorderstate interface and the externally exposed order is a judgement but if i were go with your instinct not to expose the details of your state implementation to code that uses your order class should be readable and

modern source control system can slice and dice the history of a there are many tools to statically and dynamically analyze what sort of mathematical formula would allow me to integrate the amount of activity in a file along with the number of deployments of that we are finding that even if a program completes all of its unit it requires more work than we would expect at upgrade a measure of this type should be but sitting down and thinking about even its units has me if something gets sent to a test machine i could see marking it less if something gets sent to all test boxes i could see it getting a fresh if something goes to production i could give it a nod and reduce its if there is a lot of activity within its files and it never gets sent anywhere i would ding the crap out of focus on the code assume that any data i need is at kind of commit analysis comments or time between is fair data to i think dimensional analysis could probably just be based on relative to that is a little more old code is the average age of each line of code still is simply a measure of does a larger source module rot faster than a more complex code coverage is measured in code executed often must by definition be less rotten than code never to accurately measure bitrot you would need coverage analysis to act as a bitrot have any accepted

most basic case is your login controller simply handing a snapshot of the array to the other in this your login controller will need to have references to instances of the other and it will set some property of those instances to the remember to declare the properties with the so that the receivers hold on to your private mutable you want the other controllers to be able to modify the let them have your mutable an invitation to need to implement one property on the login instead of one property on each of the other the login property should have at least a getter and setter you can but you can implement specific accessor for you have this the other controllers should access the property in a if you implement the specific they can just use need to send to the login when they access the contents of that proxy they really access the login when they mutate the proxy they mutate the login array in comes the actual kvo want the other controllers to know when one of them the login changes the have each controller the login add itself as an observer of the property of the login remember to have them remove themselves in their order for the right notifications to get everything needs to use either accessors or that goes for the login controller should use its own accessors when mutating the instead of messaging the array the only exceptions are in and the accessor messages would be messages to a which will be a problem if you ever make the accessors it sounds like you may have way too many see if you of your logic into model objects that drastically simplifies your as cocoa is designed to work with a model being is fighting the which makes more work for i mean doing things other than or in addition to the normal behavior of a given accessor for normally just if you insert or store the object somewhere other than in an array in an instance or if you do something else in the same method as tell a view that it needs to then your accessor method is

need to separate them in some using is a weak form of hungarian notation so you might as well bite the bullet and use underscores or also feel is actually worse because in extreme cases large it is possible the will be left off and the wrong variable will be i know large methods are bad but they do occur naturally in real business applications with developers of varied using a prefix for private fields will prevent that is tempting to argue that the underscore may be forgotten in the same way as but that is incorrect because the underscore changes the name of the so the only place it could possibly be forgotten is at the not at usage within the whereas with the prefix there is no compiler error if you forget it during you no avoiding hungarian in this situation whether you use or not so bad we are forced by convention to use hungarian for interface control names and probably other places i think of right

not going to be able to do this the features built into are all scoped to the individual given that going to have to code your own method to handle the best you were using a suggest that you use a fourth make the id column in the three main tables a foreign key in which you stored the fourth and synchronize inserting a row into the fourth table with inserting a row into either of the other something into sequence values into tablea values you want to use a which suggests to me that you really care about the persistence of these id if they really only need to exist while your application is you can just use a static field to store the last used and make a helper static class private static int private static object lockobject new public static int lock return locking strictly but no harm in making this code you can handle the event on each of your three data t new datatablenewroweventargs will insure that whatever method adds a new row to each table whether your code calling or a new row being added via a data bound control each row added will have its id column set to the next

not really lines of code that get often a development style that makes things example a very long method body makes it difficult to almost always it means that some things have to be implemented separately maybe even in other have all around 10k lines files and they are really difficult to but not because of so many because the methods contain a crazy amount of logic not put more than one class in a file nested classes if you need it will automatically limit the file not give to a class more logic than its responsibilities it will limit the file you are with use partial classes to separate the files in several physical this will also more important keep your logic simple and

not sure if this assists with your but one thing i learned rather recently and took to heart is to have your data unique identifier implementation not propagate directly outside of the data but to be wrapped in an for here is an interface which wraps a interface where t class a string representation of the domain the model originated string origin the model instance identifier for the model object that this refers this is a database file or some other unique expected data type of the keydatatype performs an equality check on the two model identifiers and returns if they are otherwise is all implementations must also override the equal identifier to compare if the identifiers are otherwise is bool business logic which may have in the past passed around as unique identifiers from a identity column in your database is now passed as public iperson retrieval logic data layer will then have a class which implements and populates its internal data type with the physical unique this insulates your business layer from any changes you may have at the data such as replacing your key identifiers with

not sure there is one there are so many variables to take into including how far down the development path you comments having been through both and auditing i hope you can see where you are now at terms of could affect these you need to map the user who changed the data you normally then db triggers will need to get this information not but more work and several ways to approach this user executing common user column in each you use db triggers and you rely on affected rows count returned from then your audit triggers need to have this turned or your existing code logic modified to expect db triggers offer more but they are not as anyone with appropriate access can disable the modify data and then enable them in other ensure your db security access rights are a single table for history is not a bad way to although you will have more work to do data to if you are auditing history for multiple especially when it comes to reconstructing the audit you also have to consider locking issues if there are many tables trying to write to one audit an audit history table for each table is the other you just need each column in the audit table to be as well as storing date and time of action and the user associated with the you go with the single table unless you have a lot of time to spend on get too fancy trying to audit only on updates or although it may be tempting to avoid inserts most apps do this more often than updates or reconstructing the audit history does take a fair bit of audit tables can get so have a strategy if they start affecting options include table partitioning onto different basically think about this now and not when it becomes a problem

nt file system does not delete a file when you think it when you delete a file on an nt file system the operating system simply marks the disk space that file occupied as the file will not be truly deleted until another file is written to that location on to why windows would think it was the same exact file i believe this is due to the fact that the file was empty when you deleted it so creating a new file in the same location with the same name and the same contents makes windows think it is in fact the same i would consider this to be a a side the fact that windows handles file deletes in this way is the very reason that you are able to use utilities to recover deleted

of the largest pitfalls of code coverage is that people just talk about code coverage without actually specifying type of code coverage they are talking the characteristics of c2 and even higher levels of code coverage are so just talking about even make achieving full path coverage is pretty much if your program has decision you need tests depending on the every single bit in a value is a decision so to achieve full path coverage for an extremely simple function that just adds two you need 18446744073709551616 if you only have you already need achieving c0 coverage is important thing to is that code coverage does tell you what code was it only tells you what code was you can try it out take a codebase that has code remove all the assertions from the now the codebase has but does not test a single code coverage does not tell you only not w

of this question have been asked namely and solutions seem to boil down to two reflection to figure out calling the case of console a call to console in a and see if it fails own recommendation is to have your library export an the interface has a function or property that return the type of the the calling object has a class that implements the interface and return what type it because complexity is a concern you can control that somewhat by what you place in the a application register itself with the library then you can try throwing an error or trying some scheme of automatic using an interface and throwing an error you are making it explicit to the programmer using the library what exactly you the interaction between the two is defined by the addition the interaction is more flexible than a automatic scheme because as the get to choose how my calling binary interacts with your library rather than some mysterious set of

often works the other way mostly work in and so that might explain my difference in elegant and simple is often more reusable and flexible than code contrived and easier to understand and therefore easier to i compare code to and python code i often find the python code cleaner and more there is less rigid around declaring types that makes the code cleaner and also more said you can make code more flexible and less if you make code flexible by adding extension points explicitly it will often become less great point about extension not only in python but in most dynamically typed languages that use automatically assume you to an not an that makes code flexible and the problem is that you define your interfaces any everything automatically is an in and java you have to do that by in many cases this is and gets in the in many other cases the power to define your interface explicitly gives the developer

only for this scenario you programatically redirect to then why not put something on the querystring to say where the redirect came this would be more likely to work across muliple browser types and advantage to this approach is that be able to tell the difference between a redirect to and a direct link via a link on one of your or from the user entering the url into the address to page referrer is something the the client provides as part of the http as you rely on the this question is your comments not clear an easy solution other than all your i suspect that global might be your best more if you use fiddler any other http debugging you should be able to see that the referrer header being populated when you perform a for this is the result of a redirect an http 302 response causing ie to redirect to another msie windows nt clr media center pc clr clr clr lm zune is the http request that is generated by clicking the link on msie windows nt clr media center pc clr clr clr lm zune can see that the generated by a link on a generates the referer

problem facing is have a textbox for a date range along side a calendar the user selects a date from the it fills that date into the this happens i want to fire a javascript the event seem to ideally like to be able to add the event as an attribute to the something in date is entered into the textbox in the calendar control has an eventhandler on the when a date is the eventhandler puts the date into the i have tried setting the focus to the textbox at this then putting an onblur attribute on the but the textbox never seems to get suppose i could directly call the javascript function at this point doing or something like but that seems sloppy and never works like i want it javascript onchange event by programatically changing textbox

processes are using the same each process gets its own private copy of that static all you need to do is make the list be a global variable in a and link to that dll from every that there is no need to pass anything additional idea of trapping the destruction of the list is fraught with due to the unpredictability of the order of destruction of objects in a would be a lot simpler to dump out the contents of the list at the end of your or not using a smart pointer class in a consistent then do it may be worth looking for cyclic reference counts object a has a count on object and vice this is a common cause of unreleased force all static destructors to run and release so you can then examine the entries in the list need to structure your application a certain you have a very minimal exe that launches the and loads a number of other dlls that actually do all the these other dlls are loaded with somehow by com or a the loadlibrary api works by either loading the dll into the or else incrementing an internal reference counter on the dll if it is already the freelibrary api decrements the counter until it reaches zero and then unloads the dll which point the static destructors for that dll will this we now add our diagnostic dll that holds a list of all outstanding reference counted all the other dlls use linkage to the diagnostic and the exe uses loadlibrary on it as is about to the exe goes through the list of dll handles it previously and calls freelibrary on all of by keeping the diagnostic dll it ensures still there at the the theory at in what order should the other dlls be if has static pointers to objects defined in then you better unload a so you need to have some idea of how your various dlls form a with higher layers depending on lower thus giving you a safe order in which to unload once unloaded all the any entries in the diagnostic list that refer to objects in the dlls will now be pointing to valid data on the but the vtable will be pointing at code that was defined by the dlls that have now been so you be able to call virtual functions on those you should be able to examine their data

seems to be assuming a object possibly because of the syntax used in the but it is quite possible to change the class of an instance at runtime in other clos allows changing the class of an instance at any and a and efficient terminology and structure is slightly methods to classes in never heard a name for this specific type of the function which does this is simply called gabriel to call the after which formalized as many of the internals of clos for wonder why want to do i see two big advantages over simply creating a new changing class can be as simple as updating a and updating any slots that if the classes are very this can be done with no new memory if a dozen places already have a reference to the old creating a new instance change what they point if you need to update each one that could add a lot of complexity for what should be a simple operation in not to say always the right but nice to have the ability to do this when you want an and a new instance similar to that are very different and i like being able to say exactly what i

should be as terse as necessary and no remarks aside there are several factors affecting just how terse it should longer than you think of likely is dependent on many things but the original coder has a big part to play in reading just the think intellisense and the reading it sometimes with the help of programs like diff not the same person that wrote performance these things combine to produce a set of sometimes competing forces which may want more or less these is the key to effective which are more important is totally dependent on the problem your software is trying to off lets take the easy they read your code they are quite capable of doing so irrespective of the they might be a little slower but this is something that is normally hard to measure is unlikely you will go beyond 1 or two orders of magnitude of verbosity than the minimum theoretical exceptions are where you are something like meta programming via a preprocessor to do lots of expansion for this can take a time when here you must decide if this trade off is worth they will be people with similar context to you and they will be reading the source in a similar situation to when you wrote by this it means that if the function was in a called foo then there is no need to go putting foo in front of the foo aspect of it should be quite clear from this makes changing this aspect easier in familiar with the idioms of the of programming you are using will be quite capable of understanding several constructs which are extremely index variables called for example are as terse as you can get but are normally not a problem until your loop becomes you see an interesting the value of terseness is often proportional to the complexity of the block of code within which it as this block becomes more terse the variables within it benefit more from being by writing code in with limited responsibility it becomes easier and more helpful to keep things terse as there is less scope for confusion on the part of a paradoxically this can lead to the need for the context to be more thus longer method and class lifespan and probability of bugs factor into how often you will have to either read the code or debug through many debuggers support break points at multiple points on a line spotting where there are two but some do therefore care should be taken on if you intend to break point within it a lot to make sure you can place and control these with minimal the code has a low probability of bugs but a long lifespan you have another interesting the probability of the code being comprehensible when you come to need to change it is much lower will have a worse memory or may not even be there any this code therefore will benefit from being slightly less terse than occasion you might have to sacrifice a compact but clear representation of something to satisfy a performance perhaps you must bit pack for never a nice thing to read in code but unavoidable if you have to fit in a certain amount of like these are hopefully language constructs can encourage terse code anonymous inner lambdas to name but a where these concepts make sense to use use them the idea is that they reduce boiler plate and expose you do the same thing repeatedly and have a certain amount of code duplication consider a shared but remember that if you must make the shared code less clear an additional if statement or unused variables in one of the code then you may not have a net inference is powerful but remember that the compiler is sometimes much better at it than a if you are saying x new then x new is no stretch at all gets better as flibble gets compare with flibble common sense helps if you would never have to use intellisense to work it out you certainly should consider using other useful rules of actions on a single line often confuse effects often confuse humans or matter at all conceptually unless part of a wider expression for helps most humans to infer structure far more than brackets rules are often by humans rather than remembered as a set of this means that needless the bracketing can be harmful for readability where the idiom is common but useful where the usage is not so not is often a single when using this in an if statement consider whether it can be restructured to not require this may not be possible the resulting contortions to name or ordering of code outweigh the removal leave it

so it turns out that the default implementation of the function works differently depending on whether the referenced script file is on the same domain or external references such cause jquery to create an external script which can be debugged with no if you reference a local script file such as any of the jquery will download the script content asynchronously and then add it as inline script latter approach does work with any debugger that i tested ie8 workaround is to override the function so that it always creates an external reference rather than inline here is the script to do i have tested this in and ie replace the normal jquery getscript function with one that debugging and which references the script files as external rather than var head var script handle script var done attach handlers for all if done if handle memory leak in we handle everything using the script element return

solution you are proposing has too much i would suggest you store the data in at least buckets instead of hourly and the time zone be normalized to if a user requests hourly data for 1 2pm from utc you can fetch data for from your system and show if you store data in increments you service requests to users in time zones with n hour daily numbers you would need to aggregate 48 the slots to pick would be determined by the time gets interesting when you get to annual data because you end up having to aggregate to ease that computation i would suggest you get the annual data per utc time and the subtract aggregate data for the first for hours of the year and add aggregate data for the first hours of the next this will essentially shift the whole year by hours and the work is not that working from you can tweak the system turns out kathmandu is gmt so you would need to store the data in buckets instead of another easy improvement is around aggregating annual so you have to add buckets each time and without requiring one aggregate per aggregate the annual data from jan 02 dec since the maximum difference between any two countries is 23 this means that you can take the annual data 02 dec and add a few buckets before and after as for example for a utc timezone you would add all buckets on jan 01 after all buckets on dec and on jan 01 the following year up to 0500

the original answer below is really dealing in terms of if the sequences are short all the calls through building a etc will actually be more expensive than using in that case both calls will be really pretty quick other definitely scales better as the two sequences get but for if absolutely that the sequences are the nested loop solution will be will be faster than the solution but as casperone will be faster than because it will exit as soon as it sees an sequences of length n and intersect will be whereas the solution is builds up a from the sequence takes and then loops through the outer sequence takes yielding any element which is in the these results are streamed the inner sequence will be evaluated when the first element is requested from but this only goes as far as finding the first match using have an if there are any so we need to take the overall number of matches into consideration when working out the results from linq rocks well worth getting your head round well as deferred

the past time i have been working on a zend framework based webshop application that we are building from the application has been successfully been set up for several but we are stumbling upon more and more problems regarding extensibility and modularity of the lot of clients require a lot of different approaches on some often requiring customizing default modules or extending i have been looking on the web for zend framework based code that could guide me to this and so far has been the only example i have come up although magento seems to do a very good job offering extensibility and the code is far too complex and extensive for my current needs so it an ideal it would work as client gets the application models should be easily overridden or modules should be easily there any other zend framework based applications or other pointers that could guide me in the right in is the best way to create a modular

the point where you are reaching a sufficient portion of your target audience that the cost becomes too great to make up for the additional little bit you gain by supporting a most is too much to drop for the little bit of work required to support ie5 is small and the compatibility issues large enough that it make sense to support running a site oriented to a technical audience you might be able to drop ie6 as very few of your target audience would be turned and the additional work to support them is greater than the value they represent to your screen resolution keep in mind that more and more users are experiencing the internet through mobile this is a question that you can only answer by looking at your and your and making a judgment the most big sites support a wide range of resolutions and devices but you may only need to support one once you look at your audience and	
the popular php frameworks today use their own view layer implementation that is based on pure php templates and lots of tried some of them and always found that this approach introduced huge complications to quite simple for in zend framework forms and the pagination use their own solutions to customize the look of these the helpers providing also quite slow and the whole view in my opinion does not exist as a one but many of its functionality is delegated to other parts of the the same configuration problems occured in symfony and admin and in kohana i was forced to duplicate the same code over all my is php really a good choice for the view do you also find these implementations inconvenient or why despite all these problems they are good and cannot be for example by a smart template engine mean smarty you find the view implementations in php frameworks

there is no cost to the do when writing the is just as easy to write as so prefer the there is no cost to the other going back and making this change takes and it most likely make a noticeable so you probably bother with it can make a on probably but for complex the compiler is unlikely to be able to optimize it the reason for this is that the increment operation no is no longer an intrinsic built into the but a function defined in the the compiler may be able to optimize it like any other but it can in assume that can be used instead of the two functions may do entirely different when determining which optimizations can be done by the consider whether it has enough information to perform in this the compiler know that and perform the same modifications to the so it can not assume that one can be replaced with the but you have this so you can safely perform the of the others you mention can usually be done very efficiently by the can be done by the and usually better at it than all it needs to know is how large a proportion of the function consists of function call over and how often is it a big function that is called often probably be because you end up copying a lot of resulting in a larger and more instruction cache inlining is always a and the compiler is better at weighing all the factors than unrolling is a purely mechanic and the compiler can do that same goes for strength swapping inner and outer loops is because the compiler has to prove that the changed order of traversal affect the which is difficult to do so here is an optimization you should do even in the simple ones that the compiler is able to you sometimes have information your compiler if you know that a function is going to be called extremely even if only called from one it may be worth checking whether the compiler automatically inlines and do it manually if you may know more about a loop than the compiler as well that the number of iterations will always be a multiple of so you can safely unroll it 4 the compiler may not have this so if it were to inline the it would have to insert an epilog to ensure that the last few iterations get performed such optimizations can still be if you actually need the and you have information that the compiler outperform the compiler on purely mechanical but you may be able to make assumptions that the compiler and is when able to optimize better than the	
there is no need to expose a setter for the bars internally you hold a reference to the which as kent suggests could be marked as through the getter the caller can do what they want with the collection with the methods available but crucially they can never change the internal reference you hold to the collection then allows you to control what methods are as jamie having the property return type would result in the bars property exposing a readonly exposing means the contents of the collection could be a setter on the property would leave it wide open for the caller to do what they want and you are no longer in the question edit it really depends on how the object will be your main concern is to initialise from an existing list of bars list of bars previously latest code example for forces the caller to initialise via the constructor but then also allows them to change the collection via the foo new allowing an object to be initialised via the constructor you need to ask yourself why you are doing is the to allow the calling code to supply values that can be subsequently changed via you want to restrict how the object is forcing values certain combinations of to be set on object construction and remain fixed throughout the lifetime of the need to ask yourself do you want the caller to be able to change the contents of the bars collection after the object has been no make the bars property expose a read only yes add a default constructor to the object so that the caller have to supply a list to initialise but they will have the option to do so if they so choose via the overloaded

thing to consider is using an raii class to manage the allocation of course only useful if your macro can be restricted to you want to avoid hitting the heap for performance take a look at the techniques used by matthew template class this will allocate on the stack unless your runtime size request exceeds a size specified at compiler time so you get the speed of no heap allocation for the majority of allocations you size the template but everything still works correctly if your exceed that stlsoft has a whole lot of cruft to deal with portability you may want to look at a simpler version of which is described in found it quite handy in an embedded

think that the main reasons that is not a keyword no compelling reason for it to the designers of the c and languages have always preferred to have language features be implemented in the library if possible and keywords to a language can create problems for an existing body of legacy this is another reason they are generally resistant to adding new in discussing the next major revision of the had this to improvements should be done in such a way that the resulting language is easier to learn and among the rules of thumb for the committee standard library facilities to language extensions

think the best approach is to introduce 1 concept at a you need to explain arrays in the first you can detangle almost anything by introducing 1 concept at a would teach them in this can teach simple arrays first so they understand the ability to have multiple data slots accessible from a single variable following need an understanding of you can teach about pointers and how they starting with some simple y sure to give a special emphasis that a pointer is just like any other it stores a memory is no need to get into the stack vs heap just to iterate over arrays with the first the second you can teach more complicated to do pointer i shorthand for arrays to functions as array pointets vs pointer param arrays are continuous blocks of string sizeof works with pointers vs array types size vs buffer more complicated concepts like allocating and the levels of arrays all examples make heavy use of sizeof and printing it really helps to understand going	
think the best way to deal with this kind of stuff is through if their stuff they take the heat and have to find the even if the root cause is somewhere their portion of the problem is that they catch it prior to that this may not actually convince them to change their habits	
think the problem is that they estimate the number of steps so much as that often the wrong definition of is in your example of the installer going from 0 to in 10 seconds and then an hour for the seen that happen when the programmer decided to count the number of files to not the number of there were 10 9 of them were 5k each and the last was a 2gig the first 9 would copy really fast and the last would be counting files was the wrong thing to should have counted problem if you want to count bytes then you need to implement your own copy routine so you can provide status updates during the copy of the large is is really worth it to implement your own copy other problem is that an install many other is made up of stacks of routines that can be quite these routines can do a lot of but likely generic and have nothing in them that is capable of updating some progress meter at a much higher need to reimplement a number of common routines to get good progress for a robust i think that would be really the particular steps could be defined in a config but need to have progress updates from every part of the install the time to do these things would obviously vary from machine to so likely be way off of once done the install on a specific machine you could likely estimate the install on that machine next

think their explanation sums it primary reason we created fan to write software that can run on both the java vm and the the reality is that many organizations are committed to one the other of these look better than all other in the absence of any information about them blog is just an error i see no reason why they would necessarily get this righter than language starts out fairly elegant for the set of things it was designed for i see some awkwardness in the little fan code i looked at just the real question is how well it scales to completely new and we simply know that if your organization has a rule that must run on our then it may be an acceptable compromise for giving up an awful lot just for vm for yours is the first fan question here on so a couple of fewer than what problem is fan the best python and ruby can already run on both vms have big communities and big and seem to be about the same level of but are far more	
think there are three steps in this you believe that there should always be a comparison inside an so you write more realistically string f new you learn that it is fine to ask and that this formatting allows better reading as a sentence in this example this is a at you get old and you learn that is not very and that gives your poor brain some clue what is happening and that all these harsh claims of yada are all a little as for the in java it would not make a shred of i think is so much this is the easiest optimization a compiler could i would bet some money that the performance is the	
think this is a great begun a series of blog posts about it answer is correct in the narrowest let me rephrase in my own words implicitly including some of the is no value in operations that are not cpu there is little value in operations that are only cpu bound short periods of less a few hundred doing so will most likely cause program to be more and learning how to implement fine parallelism is complicated and it well is is true as far as it but i belive the answer is richer for a broader set of there are many reasons to use and then implicitly techniques in your production for it is a huge benefit to your users to move disk and network operations off your user interface has nothing to do with increasing the throughput of compute bound and everything to do with keeping a user interface you need a graphical ui here command line and server based can benefit for this as completely agree that taking a cpu bound operation and paralyzing it can often be a complex task requiring knowledge of fine grained cpu cpu instruction this can be classically i would argue that the need to do his is there are just not that many problems that need this kind of fine grained they do exist and may deal this this every but i would argue that in the day to day life of most this is pretty there are good reasons to learn the fundamentals of and thus can make your program more responsive from a user perspective by moving longer operations off the message loop for things that are not cpu it can often make sense to do them in can break up complex single threaded state machines into more procedural the os already does a lot for you and you can use libraries that are enabled operating systems and libraries are not magic i argue that it is valuable for most develops to learn the basics of this will let you write better software that your users are happier not every program should be or it is just fine for some things to be implemented in a simple single threaded take this as advice that every program should be use your own good judgment it can often be a valuable technique and very beneficial in many as mentioned i plan on blogging about this a bit starting feel free to follow along and post comments there as you feel

think what you mean to ask does and casting work for and are asking about implicit casting which automatically coverts one object to another defined you will not be able to do this for an and because they are already defined in the framework and you are not able to reduce the scope of the by casting it to an but if you were using that as an example for actual objects that you created you can use the link to learn more about how this works and how to implement you can always use the convert method to convert them to the right int myproperty	
think you are looking for like in that you specify the number of in but it require that you have a notion of the objects clustering like every cluster has a representative which is the member of the cluster closest to the you could think of it as a version of that finds instead of all you need is a distance metric to cluster and used this in some of my own work for exactly the same reasons you is not the fastest but there are fast variants that are probably good enough for your here are descriptions of the algorithms and links to the documentation for their implementations in is the basic implementation of is a much sampled version of it works by clustering randomly sampled subset of objects with pam and grouping the entire set of objects based on the you should still be able to get very good clusterings fast with you need more a that gives an overview of these and other

think your understanding is pretty much if you ignore the values and just look at the then for every node in the first tree there must be a corresponding node in the other tree and vice both trees would have the same number of you could write a algorithm to confirm this isomorphism by attempting all possible mapping and ensuring that for every node in the first tree that gets mapped to a node in the the corresponding mapping happens with the parent and with the two are obviously efficient algorithms to check for may benefit from reading about trees are a special easier to case since they do not have

this have anything to do with the fact that you have a surrogate key in the storeproducts table happens if you remove this surrogate key column and put the primary key on the combination of the and columns believe if you want to have a surrogate key on the storeproducts have to create yet another you want to use the surrogate have to use the idbag does your product class and mapping look like see that you specify the attribute in your mapping of the products collection in the store you do this thus you have a then you should add the store to the stores collection of the product as the nh made only to the inverse of the association are not this means that nhibernate has representations in memory for bidirectional one from a to b and another link from b this is easier to understand if think about the object model how we create a relationship in the category now about the the item now about the no nothing will be the relationship will be side is used to the representation to we would get an and probably even foreign key violation if both trigger the same is of also true for may map a association by mapping association to the table as a association and declaring end that only one of the ends should be a product to a should be done like class public void product p false class public void store s false important to check whether the collection already contains the item to be otherwise end up in an infinite

using you have a lot of freedom to move memory i think that using a separate thread is probably not the best or way my guess is be better off using a type of incremental copying where on each or you compact forwards or backwards in some number of allocated with the number of bytes that you copy depleting a that is periodically reset to its initial value on each screen course only whole blocks are idea is that copying a given number of bytes takes a fairly predictable amount of so you can estimate how many bytes of copying you can safely perform per screen and limit yourself to if enough time in the a call to or will completely defragment otherwise it will defragment it as much as possible in the given the time are some questions leaving unresolved here exactly how to compact the a standard copying allocator can just start allocating from the then copy everything to the back up memory at the when memory runs but you have that freedom you might need some heuristics to decide whether to move blocks forward or the important thing is to avoid oscillations same block being moved forwards then backwards on successive calls to or

wanted to add my been working in javafx for the last 4 days on my first little using as some been programming professionally for about 9 starting with and have been doing java and for the last 6 javafx its way more frustrating that it should here are some syntax is just odd at it could easily be more like since its but the syntax an easy transition from of items in a file actually which means you run into stupid circular reference and you use this variable yet because it been problems that the compiler should handle with but things just on swing controls always for example seem to be handling is just if an exception occurs that there is no real way to tell other than the java and ui elements start to react for make a swingtext box and bind its value to a now trying to edit the value in the text box will throw an exception because you cant edit the bound however in the the text box just starts having funny things some characters only sometimes backspace does sometimes it deletes a sometimes you can press 2 keys ont eh keyboard like and and the text box will end up having entered in it instead of my absolute problem with javafx development right now is it is pathetically bad at errors display wrong in the ide had it flag comments as the intellisence only works like of the event he code templates preprogrammed in the ide for drag dropping controls i forget which but one of them drops a at the end of the inserted code that is never valid and always has to be manually its just plain and is unacceptable for a company like gripe is general its just somehow the javafx api even come up as the search result on google when searching for tons of out on the web work any more as every version has major refactoring and classes removed or i give jfx a 4 out of i to like but jfx just cut its definitely not what i would consider

was a little surprised that i find this question on principles should i consider if i want to incorporate elements of someone website into my other the web is a fairly open in the sense that the dominant and javascript are distributed in source if you see something cool on a you in look at the source and copy and paste the bits you in i seem to remember reading somewhere that html was designed this way to foster innovation in page but on the other someone put in the hard work of designing that website and translating the design into just common decency to give people credit when you reuse significant portions of their and perhaps the page author holds a copyright on the page source know exactly how copyright protection applies not a so how do you balance the ease of using parts of other web pages with the rights of the page reason i ask is that i was recently advising an acquaintance whose company wanted to redesign their they were very impressed with the home page of the mit department of architecture and wanted to do something i suggested that my acquaintance contact mit and ask whether they would object to his company using the same look and feel as the of after a couple of weeks he got no so now is it ethical legal for his company to just go ahead and take the design elements they want from the mit or should they stay away from it without explicit or would it have been okay from the beginning was it unnecessary to try contacting mit the answer will also have implications for how i design my own so interested to find out what the so community has to for reusing elements of a web

was going to say i know of any such thing but then i saw the other might interest you to know that an execution profiler does exactly what asking about it tracks the amount of time spent executing each a profiler basically works by recording the instruction pointer the address of the currently executing every 10ms or after the program is done you invoke a postprocessor that examines the list of ips and the and converts those addresses into function so suggest just using the instruction rather than the function both because easier to code and because more efficient to work with a single number than with a

was writing up this question and in the it forced me to think a little harder and i answered it though i still completely understand why it solved have an account on a shared host with 2 domains using the stack to run a few things like a blog and another site i am planning to kick off both of my domains point to the the first is the original i used to the second is a root domain pointer i here is how i want it to blog site2 be directed here if site2 junk if you type in or that behaves as expected and i am fine with for i have the rewrite rule configured like the rule is supposed to match any path if the host is pick off the path to the requested resource and format it so when somebody types in this resolves to without the user ever this is working as advertised except when the user does not type a trailing slash in a iis 7 looses its brain here and formats it out like because a 2nd request is automatically issued for the trailing slash and a 404 i updated the action to seems to have resolved but why iis 7 now spit out how does it know not to append a trailing slash to a document 7 url rewriting and two

we can assume order of scores in the array is always in the order by then by the round number of rounds is same for each what we can do is print each score as we moved through the array while calculating the total in the process but resetting it if we see a new as check whether we have to move to a new if check whether we have anything to print resetting the if if for print reset the total and various variables for the new the last player is not printed because we exited the loop before the print so we need a print statement print round 0 round 1 10 7 6 12 should be quite efficient because it only goes through the array

you see why taking have and for each replace is iterating through the and making a new not an exact as any token found is replaced with the new token but for each token reading newing up of and writing can we think of a better way of doing how about instead of iterating the string for each we instead walk it walking create an empty output we walk the source if we find a jump characters and write out the obfuscated otherwise proceed to the next turning the process inside doing the for loop on the long and at each point looking for a to make this want quick for the so we put them into some sort of associative array see why it is taking long but not sure on the for each string on which i have 1 to 2 tokans i want to so character by character looking for of a thousand tokens what takes longest in up when we create a what likely happens is that some amount of space is allocated 64 and that whenever we append more than its current it doubles its and then copies the old character buffer to the new possible we can can and not have to if we start with 64 to get up to we allocate and then then then then then 2048 we do this twenty times to get up to and in getting allocated just to throw it by using something analogous to will at least let us do that all at but still all at once for at least producing a temporary string for if you have 2000 allocating about a 2 billion bytes of all to end up with each throwaway contains the transformation of the previous resulting with the current token why this is taking so deciding which token to apply at each also takes you may wish to use a regular which internally builds a state machine to run through all rather than a set as i suggested but really killing you is the time to allocate all that for 2000 copies of a gibson your tokens so you have look for a thousand tokens the sort would take but it would probably end being faster since you have search thousands of tokens was my reasoning behind putting them into an associative array java but the other problem is if one token is and another is if there are any common that how do we is where answer comes in he delegates the matching to a which is a great as a regex already defines and implements how to do once the match is we can examine then use a java map an associative to find the obfuscated token for the unobfuscated wanted to concentrate my answer on the not just how to fix but on why there was a problem in the first
