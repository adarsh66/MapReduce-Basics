a code coverage tells you what you definitely not what you of building a valuable unit test suite is finding the most code and asking hard questions of you want to make sure the tough stuff works as a coverage figures have no notion of the of nor the quality of my many of the most important tests you will ever write are the tests that barely add any coverage at all cases that add a few extra here and but find loads of problem with setting hard and coverage targets is that developers may have to start bending over backwards to test their making code and then just if you hit coverage with great tests then but in most situations the extra effort is just not worth people start with numbers rather than focussing on the quality of the seen badly written tests that have just as seen excellent tests that only have i tend to look at coverage as an indicator of what definitely been

a good first certainly usable as as found i specifically recommend it for an introduction to programming in general prefer python or but it depends on your goals and learning taught programming in c and when approached properly is no more your goal is simply to learn for some particular i really know a better method than going ahead and learning you like you might want to jump into the learning curve is fairly but once through it know a lot of still do learn how to use the vi after would recommend learning the stuff learn vectors rather than use smart rather than ordinary that sort of partly because you should wind up programming like that most and partly because less stuff to remember at you will need to learn the stuff just like need to learn the stuff

a is what you get when you put the three the model handles the data the view handles the actual html the user sees and the controller decides how they interface together to show the desired my choice as to use a separate controller or another method to an existing controller hinges on how close the operation is to the other that i say i wanted to have a useradmin now that would handle adding a deleting a changing if i was adding functionality that dealt with changing a account in some way i would most likely put it in if i had separated them out into their own i would naturally add another controllers allow you to house similar tasks together so they may leverage what is already in the rather than having to recreate what has already been a lot of it is how the programmer thinks it should be what makes sense to you may not make sense to that is the the

a major holdup to wider adoption is that the language is still so rapidly d1 a relatively conservative attempt to create a better by adding some lessons learned in the past years from languages like java and a nice but it have any huge killer so understandable that switching costs would be enough to discourage on the other is still in but represents much more significant it attempts to bridge the gap between functional and imperative with features such const reachable from a object is itself you mark a function as pure and the compiler enforces that it can have no externally visible side it use mutable state freely as long as not visible outside of the pure this implemented but the idea is to make all data unshared between threads by have the compiler automatically insert memory when needed if data is and have the type system prevent accidental also adds some features to make d more friendly to library such as return by alias this an implicit cast template alias arguments passing any symbol as an argument to a template constraints to and real message here give d d1 is a but relatively conservative most of the really impressive killer features are in but still in

a previous project i used single root inheritance for my mvc worked and was effective at giving data to the site but was a bit of a pain in the controller to properly construct the root view data each we had to override method tempted to try attribute viewdata injection this and was wondering if anyone knew of any pitfalls to this technique involves letting the action method set the then using an attribute to set a viewdata item for data destined for use by the site i can strongly type the retrival with viewdatadictionary extension help is greatly going down the filter injection approach and it feels cleaner than the other much i got my ioc container to property inject into the filters to give them the necessary providers they need for building common while i have to write a filter and a helper method for each i want to be it frees up the construction of model data in the controller else gone down this path i think i stumped stackoverflow single root inheritance hierarchy or viewdata injection with

advantage of declaring it const is that you modify it in an obscure way which code inspection might for example by passing it by reference into a function which modifies its arguable disadvantage is that you pass it into code which takes reference that it actually if you really believe in this is actually an advantage in because it encourages you to make the rest of your code but if you have to make quick changes when or if already published the api and change then it looks to you like a darn good functions are then you really need to tell you whether or not a local variable is going to be explicitly modified by you can see all the uses of the variable right in front of but in real where functions sometimes get and where people use reference parameters and sometimes even and where you want to read and understand code as quickly as then it can help a tend to use it when i and not sweat it if i i get most use out of it when i need to remove const from a that tells me that my original conception of that variable was and i need to carefully check that no expression using it actually relies on it not given that has the const if going to write code that relies on a variable not you may as well get the compiler on your usually not worth worrying about compiler a good compiler can tell that if you modify a and take any references to then it can apply appropriate optimisations whether you mark it const or

advise against c and qt and would also recommend your background in pascal and probably javascript feel much more comfortable with done a lot of coding in pascal and where pascal guides you to avoid programming c lets you step right even invites and then have a hard time figuring out why it went qt is a very abstract framework and requires you to learn a lot before you can get something just like with when compared to the easyness we used to have with tp back is much more like pascal in this and its ide is quite modern in regards to supporting your with an gui editor to fill in the gaps for handling ui code when you get into huge program rb loses some of its appeal because it is missing tools to give you a good overview of complex class interactions thing is that qt is more likely to cause mac apps than rb rb visually guides you to get it all aligned nicely in qt you have to work with to position your objects least it was that way when i used qt 2 years written quite a few apps in rb and am pretty happy with the probably write those looking apps that compete with the best on the open small business but if you just want to get some solid code with an ui acceptable to the average give rb a not but its rather small community is on your side eager to instead of bashing everyone trying to talk sense

after my post i think i am being a little bit unclear about what the problem let me try to can leave comments on my site using a textarea field in a it should be possible to add line breaks in the comment using the comment is then stored as a string in a to make it and later on retrieved from the database and displayed on the regular line breaks are not recognized when the comment is can edit their and in that case the original comment is displayed in a textarea field to be modified image the problem is that if there are any the code is not valid as xhtml error message i make the code valid using any other type of line as stated in the regular line breaks in combination with does not work breaks are displayed in the textarea but not when the comment is displayed as normal text on the have a which includes a textarea field to leave and i want it to be able to add line breaks using below is a simple works as however it does not validate as xhtml transitional when using the w3c validation this is the error i line column document type does not allow element element named above was found in a context where it is not this could mean that you have incorrectly nested elements such as a element in the section instead of inside or two elements that overlap is not common cause for this error is the use of xhtml syntax in html due to rules of implicitly closed this error can create cascading for using tags for and in the section of a html document may cause the parser to infer the end of the section and the beginning of the section and are not hence the reported there a way to make the line breaks valid or do i need to find a workaround using specific tags for line breaks in the textarea field and then replacing them with later on when displaying the to add line breaks in a textarea field while keeping it xhtml

am writing a report to return details about an object in my my application lets users create their own flags for use against file flags basically consist of a then flag instances store a bit value to indicate whether it is set for the parent file want to write a query that returns one row per file in the where the first few columns in the result set contain the file details size and the remaining columns are the flag with bit values returned to indicate whether the flag is set for the given file that make how do i go about writing the for any part of this i need to run a sub query that returns the flags that have been created by the user do not know these at design then incorporate a check for each flag value in the main query to return details about the schema as a row in this table indicates that the flag is set for the need the query to return a result set with columns something like question how can i dynamically add columns to a sql query result

and wsdl are extremely complicated which have many implementations that support different subsets of the soap does not map very well to a simple foreign function interface in the same way that you have to understand about xml xml and so on to produce correct soap all you need to do to call an service is to define and endpoint and call a method on for in there are other techniques that can also be much more simple and such as plain xml or over http referred to as though that implies certain other design the advantage of something like xml or json over http is that easy to use from javascript or even just a dumb web page with a form it can also be scripted easily from the command line with tools like it works with just about any language as http xml and json libraries are available almost and even if a json parser is not it is very easy to write your i should clarify that i am referring to how heavyweight soap as opposed to heavy weight it is in terms of raw amount of i think that the raw amount of data is less important it adds up quick if you need to handle lots of small while how conceptually heavyweight it is is quite because that means that there are a lot more places where something can go where there can be an

answer directly but as you are designing your database structures you might want to take at some of the the objects in the in particular look at the assignment and gradingassignment for how to store the you could use a rdbms or perhaps database if this is just a small personal project you could just serialize the data to something like csv or whatever and storing it as a it might be better in the long run to use a database a database format will probably scale a lot	
answer is about as good as but not likely to be too if someone wants to look at your images and they know anything about image open it in a hex editor and most likely recognize what they see as a jpeg with the magic header you really want to keep someone from viewing your construct your own image not as hard as it and put as little metadata in as and then hope that or encrypt or put them into an your own archive format for best and hope anything encoded has to be decoded before it can be and any hacker can trace their way through your decoding routine and figure out how it why are you trying to hide things from your users

answer your first a data structure that is too large to fit into memory is usually divided into usually all pages are the same size and each page contains part of the data to use the data you load and unload common option is not commonly used in rdbms but is common with things like xml and media is where you process the data in order by loading the next section and discarding the previous that also answers your second if you use paging than the file structure is a sequence of pages of the same if you use streaming than the data should be laid out in the order going to use it the case of a tree likely going to be either dfs or bfs depending on your

answer your what software do i need to download and there are a number of subversion clients for including that integrates with visualstudio and one that is very popular with our which integrates with windows the server recommend going with a hosted solution if your corporate policies just put into google and compare the available if i recommend installing the windows binaries from the what do i need to install the software windows subversion is available for all major platforms from the above so if a windows windows 2003 is if you are you may have a bit of an easier time configuring it behind apache on subversion is and has instructions for configuration on all platforms should i have a dedicated server or is an existing file server i recommend hosting externally over hosting it any hosting provider worth using will provide the following securely from anywhere via https need to configure corporate firewalls to work from home or a client backups need to set up new backup procedures for that dedicated server or file server in your need to worry about the box melting down or having some other issue that your team will have to deal with setup rather than having to learn server side configuration your company requires hosting it and there is sufficient space carved out on the file i would say not a problem to use an existing if you have a dedicated server that will be better just from the perspective of not having to with other parts of the organization assuming a shared how quickly will developers get up to is the integration similar enough to just carry on as there is a slight learning curve for but chapter 2 of the bean as well as the documentation for the clients explains how a regular work cycle if your developers are familiar with cvs be up to speed in no if they it may take a little while to get used to the notion that you have to lock files to work on them has a locking mechanism but not designed to be part of the standard work feel free to contact me directly if you have any other

apply to tab it applies to button bars that you have configured on the inside the guessing your app has the inside the is the standard this means that pushing a new navigation view affect the uitabbar the tab bar is outside the control of the are two ways around the tab bar inside the navigation control the into the navigation the tab bar will slide as any normal a modal view controller instead will replace the whole screen but animates differently to standard navigation the advantage with this is it presents a distinct interface good for special read documentation for interweb search for details on how this is if you want within a perhaps you should consider using or	
appreciate some opinions on a concern i have a table in my with the basic stuff like application requires that i track a vast number of attributes for each so much that i will likely run out of columns storage tempted to add a userproperties table with propertykey and propertyvalue this approach fits well with the concern is that if each user has say 100 when the database has a million users in have property would think that with a clustered index on the that access will still be screaming and you are really storing about the same amount of data as you would with the ideas or thoughts on performance ideas for a better db thanks so much for all the great have been toying around with the and one thing keeps bothering i need to query on some of these attributes pretty and worse these queries could involve finding all users who match criteria on as many as 10 of these attributes at the same a i am now leaning towards the but possibly splitting the data off into one separate forming a relationship keyed on the using and while i think tables with this many columns are i think considering all the challenges and it is probably the right but i am still eager to hear other design

approach taken is too move the code out of the event handlers essentially placed a class next to the which implements the event handlers and holds the ui state beside the this move i have gained a pretty clear seperation of the form and the actual interaction with the remaining app and was able to introduce tests at that another result of this was that the view becomes passive pretty refactor the presenter now holds the event in a seperate step and introduce domain objects only after moved all uses of these objects out of all my steps would the ui dependency from the domain objects not available the presenters to use the domain services according to your design choice while at i did this i started introducing tests at the newly introduced boundaries to ensure that not breaking working code or to find bugs in the existing code	
approach to consider is to first put a simulation framework in place that you could use to develop integration starting with integration tests might seem but the problems in doing true in the environment you describe are quite probably moreso than just simulating the entire in approach would simply bypass your listed issues although it would give you many different in practice found that with a robust integration testing framework you can develop tests that exercise functionality at the unit although without unit consider writing a simulation maybe built on python or this will let you script tests quite

are a couple of issues i can see firstly the word index is reserved so in your function you should use secondly in the update statement provided your where clause should be 1 not id i have recreated your table and function using the following delimiter drop function if exists create function 30 returns declare r select into from where and return delimiter using the following update statement correctly updates set where this is just a once off update you could do it more efficiently with a temporary table mysql allow tables to join to themselves in an update temporary table tmp maxvalue1 into tmp as by tmp set should update all rows	
are a couple of other differences have any concrete abstract base classes this allows you to provide concrete implementations this can allow an abstract base class to actually provide a more rigorous wheras an interface really only describes how a class is abstract base class can have members defining the which gives more control to the base class than one interface can be implemented on a a class can only derive from a single abstract base this allows for polymorphic hierarchy using but not abstract base this also allows for a using base classes can be modified in without breaking the changes to interfaces are breaking unlike abstract base can be applied to value types structs cannot inherit from abstract base this allows behavioral guidelines to be applied on value

are called code attributes are used to mark code with properties which are usually designed to specify behavior during they are commonly used to mark properties and during execution of your code something called will be performed to examine the reflection tells the compiler to observe and obey any instructions specified by you as the coder marking attributes against the good example would be the this attribute when marked above a class indicates to the compiler that it can be serialized for the purposes of persisting the class instance or for transmitting across a medium such as soap web the following	
are dbs useful storing such and how should be a database is useful for this you could implement your own data and perhaps it would be more efficient for your specific because you can design it for that a relational database is more but you can avoid weeks or months of development time by employing a answered another question earlier today on the subject of how to handle extensible where each new has its own distinct set of many kind of each product have many your i would choose the table now suppose the himself can specify the format of in a configuration the length of each its what its values mean case of and so how do extend a implementation assume the number of packet types are relatively and then many packets are inserted with pretty much the same so you should use the ability to manage i would define an additional table for each new packet would also store the packets so each field of the packet is stored in a separate database that way you can index each column to support efficient can also define constraints so that some fields are mandatory or their values constrained by lookup leveraging the capabilities to use metadata to enforce consistent structure where already supports a declarative language for specifying fields with data why develop a different language which you then have to translate to even more suppose the data packages can varying in length and that are optional in a given packet type should permit in the corresponding	
are different from classes because they are stored on the and not on the that means that every time you call a method with the struct as a copy is created and passed to the that is why large structs are extremely would actively discourage to use structs because it could cause some subtle when you change a field of a its not going to be reflected for the caller you only changed the which is completely different behaviour to the 16 bytes i think is a reasonable maximum size of a but still in most cases it is better to have a if you still want to create a try to make it immutable at

are some good let me first say that i do not really know js at but i am a unit tester and have dealt with these i first want to point out that jsunit exists if you are not using worry too much about your method calling other methods within the same this is bound to what worries me more is the creation of the other depending on how complicated it if you are instantiating a class that does all kinds of operations over the that is too heavy for a simple unit what you would prefer to do is mock out the dependency on that class so that you can have the object produce the result you would expect to receive from its operations on the without incurring the overhead of going on the network in the other object is a bit what people typically do is have a factory method to instantiate the other the factory method can based on whether or not you are testing via a whether or not to instantiate the real object or the in you may want to make the other object a member of you and within the call the or make the decision right there whether or not to instantiate the mock or the real within the setup function or within your test cases you can set special conditions on the mock object so that it will return the proper just make sure you have tests for your other functions in the same i hope this

argument seems backwards to that a centralized revision control system is just one of many use cases of a distributed how does applying such a restriction benefit the know from experience that when a p4 server gets slow or breaks or you get too far away from it or using it has to stop like to treat the argument as a bit of a but been there where it really on site at an interop event or customer demo where we have to build something in an environment with limited network support and all that work has to come back i want to be able to revert when i make two arguments that heard ring well to take all the code and 1 is just maybe to get the full history if i not a revision control system but when it comes to the kind of fear talking about i can just grab the latest revision and just as 2 really seems like trying to use the wrong tool for the i used to get arguments from rcs users because they really thought you should lock file time to prevent two people i is out of if you have unmergeable ok to talk about i many of the people with this problem want a revision control but a snapshotting filesystem drop i understand why people even ask the should i give my developers tools that are more more and make them more kinds of

beta has just been announced at microsofts mix conference in las features of the new beta are and the ability to run applications outside of the which to me seemed to be two of the major features that wpf presentation previously offered over am currently evaluating wpf and silverlight for possible use in our companies future development and this announcement has left me confused as to the intended direction of these two ui technologies and why i would choose one over the anyone implemented a new application using wpf and if what drove you to that given the announced changes to would your decision have changed had you made it and if advice would be vs silverlight

biggest difference i find is the asynchronous model you have to adopt your silverlight does seems like an advantage it can but it does very difficult are also some limitations that can be a real challenge like the print would recommend silverlight over wpf there is no need for best possible performance can get around the absence of print support will we just know support is not can tolerate the assync can tolerate limitations on wcf support for at this there is no need to store huge amount of data on the there is no need to direct integration with client side applications like has a server to host your

consideration on the use of custom tags over udfs or cfc methods is when you find that a subroutine needs to be passed an array of child you can use nested custom tags to associate a child custom tag and its elements to a parent custom this allows you to do very nice clean coding thats easy to i know we have nicer dhtml stuff like menus and this is simply to point out an you can use cfassociate in the custom tag to the attributes to the parent custom tag and then in the access all the dynamically generated child items in the array of associated this is where you would loop and output the menu to the screen in this as another allows you to do some clever one thing in particular i use is that i set and then i can essentially force simple html tags the to get kicked through a custom tag handler at runtime so an html tag becomes intelligent at i do this so i can analize the href and the target attributes and decide if i want to display a pdf icon other mime type next to the its pretty this is especially helpful in a content management system or when 7you have html developers using dreamweaver or contribute and you want to have their tags fire smart coldfusion tags without them doing anything outside of standard html the editor doesnt know any difference and they dont need to go into view to make some fairly powerful in a custom tag you can choose to suppress output use a so this can be very useful to wrap around chunck of dynamically generated access the variable in the executionmode eq throw out the baby with the bathwater on this one i agree their usage is much less frequent since we have however there is still some powerful functionality in custom i usually have one or 2 in every application at least dozens of

couple of i have refrained myself from studies and have been focusing on this is this grid which constitutes a square of 100 available places to the aim is to start from a corner and traverse through all the places with respect to some simple and reach number 100 99 if a programmer and start with 0 instead rules for traversing two spaces hop along the vertical and horizontal one space hop along the you can visit each square only visualise here is a valid example traverse to the 8th i have been working on this puzzle out of for i have tried to solve it by hand from time to but i have never gone beyond sounds try yourself and see for yourself in order to solve the i have developed a short 100 lines of program in i am a beginner in this language i wanted to see what i can program simply applies exhaustive try error solving in other brute force depth first question arises from here the unfortunately cannot solve the problem because the state space is so big that search never ends withouh ever finding a it can go up to number 98 prints without much nonetheless not a complete program also prints out the length of the search tree it has covered so in a couple of the traverse list 65th element is covered till the for just one single this number decreases in exponentially increasing time i have run the code for quite some time and could not get beyond 50 barrier and now i am seems that this simple approach will not be enough unless i run it for how can i improve my code to be faster and more efficient so that it comes up with i am looking forward to see ideas on how and exploit specific to this to overcome finally realize into a substantial in to dave webb for relating the problem to domain it is very similar to the tour problem which relates moving knight around a chess board revisiting the same the same problem but different the square

current private implementation is private to everything outside the unit it is declared so if your reasoning for not wanting to add the statements is that you want to modify your existing then you have nothing to gain except breaking any existing code that accesses the class in the same as long as your existing units are not then the difference between and is your reasoning for the behavior is to use the compiler to help you code that takes advantage of the then adding the to one class at a time is a good incremental approach so you can get to a compilable and testable state more a whole sale change of behavior would require fixing every violation before you knew if any of them reason behaves like it does is similar to it allows certain classes procedural to access the and makes heavy use of this so a compiler switch or an all out change would break all of that implementation of is private enough for all practical purposes since typically you control the unit your class is declared if you only ever one class per and never include procedural then the difference is only

develop and operate a blogging application in which user data a scattered across many 50 other are able to close their and their must disappear from the site right we also must be able to undelete their for a given and also to make those data available for juridic authorities for another the years and different we used different flag everywhere each table has a which is updated when data is very nasty because it slows down every list generation creates a lot of updates upon it does not handle the two stage deletion described in fact we never used this but worth it for each we create a second table with the same schema plus two extra fields the extra fields are used to know if the data is still accessible for when to delete and it was deleted in the first this version is just a bit better than the previous but can be very nasty performance wise too when tables are you have to change the schema of some tables remove unique which makes the system harder to for new administrators and mentally healthy people in same approach as but we move data on a different database which allows to browse those data without impacting the for this the uniqueness constraint is done at the java so all the schemas are the the double data retention constraint is done by having a dedicated db for each which makes things have to admit that none of those approaches satisfies even if they can work up to a certain amount of i have also imagined that we could just delete some key rows in the and let the rest inconsistent scheduled for a more controlled deletion but it scares me you know other ways of doing the same keeping the same level of features could align the two durations to simplify the not looking a solution for my existing but would like to improve the next input will be highly appreciated to efficiently unpublish all datas from a particular user on a blogging

do this because you end up with a problem who owns the package that almost everything else is a subpackage method of establishing package heirarchy the filesystem does not play well with this convention at java can get away with it because package heirarchy is defined by the structure of the string literals fed to the so there need to be an explicit package also the question of what to do if you want to publicly release a package but own a domain name suitable for bodging into the package or if you end up changing your domain name for some later updates need a different package how do you know that is a newer version of how do you know that a newer if you miss your domain renewal and the name gets snatched by a domain and someone else buys the name from and they want to publicly release software should they then use the same name that you had already names and software package it seems to address two entirely different and have entirely different complicating i personally dislike convention because it violates separation of avoiding namespace collisions is nice and but i hate the thought of my namespace being defined by dependent the marketing interaction with some clarify my point in response to in a package is a directory containing an file presumably one or more module a package hierarchy requires that each package be a legitimate if two packages from different but even packages from the same share a package whether that name is or or or each one provide an for that we must also assume that these packages are likely to be installed in the same place in the directory the filesystem thus enforces that there is only so which one there is not cannot a correct answer to that nor can we reasonably merge the two files since we know what another package might need to do in that subpackages sharing a package cannot be assumed to work when both are installed unless they are specifically written to be compatible with each other least in this one this would be a distribution nightmare and would pretty much invalidate the entire point of nesting this is not specific to package though they provide the most obvious bad example and are philosophically questionable really the practical issue of shared rather than the philosophical that are my main concern the other a single large package using subpackages to better organize itself is a great since those subpackages specifically designed to work and live this is not so common in because a single conceptual package tend to require a large enough number of files to need the extra layer of

error is never as as examples error codes for program if you have an error that is do not throw an reading a you may throw an exception for not but never throw one for of you you can never write simple always wrapping code in exception and forget exceptions are very this is especially important in big so important at all in your desktop be very careful with exception you may think ok to have an then derive a from then for your smtp but unless you hold generic data in the base you will always have to catch every type of exception in that if you put the reason for the smtp error in your you must catch it if you only catch you will not have access to the a good workaround for this problem is to have a string and an int member in the base exception class and only use even for the derived unfortunately only offers a string people say that doing this means you might as well only have a single exception especially as you will always catch the base class type you do use exceptions you must take the trouble to populate them with more data than you would with an error with you must handle them immediately or they get lost in the with an it may get caught many levels away from where it was thrown like in is and gets an exception 2 levels in from unless you specify the error to be specific to the code in you may think it was thrown from the but seen code where an exception was handled many levels down the call it was a to this especially applies to oo given you enough to think the simple truth of the matter is that style means nothing in error practicality is if you have to put log statements everywhere an error can then do it matters a lot more that you can see where the code went wrong what data was being worked than you have a elegant exception hierarchy or littered your code with exception you cannot easily trace the your error handling code is are use but think about what do not misuse or overuse a misused exception is worse than no error handling at all you can grab a crash dump and view the unhandled exception to find the error in with an exception that is eaten and found over the years that the biggest assistant to debugging is write write lots of

every tried this setup but i can take a guess at what is going usercotnrols are meant to be loaded by not by you are attempting to create them by notice the difference between how you refer to them in the inner project and how it differs from the outer i believe to get this to work you will need to refer to the path location of the quick search shows how this can be done in vs 2005 but the concept should be the same in vs you can find that information option would be to not use the design surface and instead load the controls using the loadcontrol passing in the path to the important thing to take from the link i mention above is that you must make the files accessable for your outer the above link does this by using a command to copy the files to a sub folder in the outer think of the inner project as if you were going to redistribute you would have to give away not only the but also the for users to consume it they must reference the files and have their project reference your you must do the same thing as hope that is a little

exactly do you mean messed my master and can no longer branch from can always create a new branch from any commit in your no matter how it may by the way is something git has no notion you can revert your repository to any state it previously had because git will not explicitely delete any it will only garbage collect unreferenced objects every now and so you just need to find out what your repository looked or can help you you restored your local repository to a state you like you can simply push it back to your central public if that results in a push you might need to specify the flag when

exactly the same issue myself for icmp packets in actually looks like your issue is windows permissions so that post area i was planning on delving into a bit further is to check whether there is anymore information in the socketexception generated by the it just seems unreasonable that as windows is using the icmp packet to generate the exception it be recording the information in that packet you i have not been able to get very far with getting the icmp info out of the exception information at the level but i want to see if there is anything further that can be obtained with the win32 api such as getlasterror or some other calls specifically for

fact that you can break the chain at any point differentiates the chain of responsibility pattern from the decorator decorators can be thought of as executing all at once without any interaction with the other links in a chain can be thought of as executing one at a because they each depend on the previous the chain of responsibility pattern when you can conceptualize your program as a chain made up of where each link can either handle a request or pass it up the i used to work with the win32 i would sometimes need to use the hooking functionality it hooking a windows message roughly follows the chain of responsibility when you hooked a message such as your callback function would be think of the callback function as the last link in the each link in the chain can decide whether to throw away the message or pass it up the chain to the next the decorator pattern had been used in that you would have been notified of the but you would be powerless to prevent other hooks from handling it as place the chain of command pattern is used is in game you can hook engine and other in the case of a game you want to simply add you want to add functionality and prevent the game engine from performing its default

give you the ability to combine two bad traits in one wrong in pretty much every singleton gives access to an guarantee that no more than one object of this type ever be one is globals are generally we should never make objects globally accessible unless we need two may sound like it makes but think about when was the last time you created a new object instead of referencing an existing since this is tagged use an example from that do you often accidentally you intended to course we need protection against this because that kind of error just if it the correct response is to go home and sleep for hours and hope you feel only one object is simply create one if one object should be globally make it a but that mean it should be impossible to create other instances of one instance is constraint really protect us against likely but it make our code very hard to refactor and because quite often we find out that we did need more than one we have more than one we have more than one configuration we do want several our unit tests may want to be able to create and recreate these objects every to take a common a singleton should be used if and only we need the traits it we global access is because globals are generally we to prevent anyone from creating more than one instance of a class sounds to me like a design the only reason i can see for this is if creating two instances would corrupt our application state probably because the class contains a number of static members or similar in which case the obvious answer is to fix that it depend on being the only you need global access to an make it a like but constrain the number of instances that can be you absolutely positively need to constrain the number of instances of a class to and there is no way creating two instances can ever be handled then enforce but make it globally accessible as you do need both then make it a and let me know what you need that because having a hard time imagining such a

good example comes from order an order from a customer typically has an order number that identifies the some data that occurs once per order such as the order date and the customer and a series of line each line item contains an item number that identifies a line item within an a product the quantity of that the price of the and the amount for the line which could be computed by multiplying the quantity by the number that identifies a line item only identifies it in the context of a single the first line item in every order is item number the complete identity of a line item is the item number together with the order number of which it is a parent child relationship between orders and line items is therefore an identifying a closely related concept in er modeling goes by the name where line item is a subentity of a subentity has a mandatory identitying relationship to the entity that subordinate classical database the primary key of the lineitems table would be some of designers would give an item a separate that serves as a primary and is autoincremented by the i recommend classical design in this

got a number of reference counted classes in some of my and also in dlls those applications all inheriting from and implementing a irefcounted order to help with finding the source of these memory leaks i want each application to maintain a list of all these refrence counted classes in problem is the managing of instances of these lists such that their useage does not effect the usage of my classes i need to pass a pointer to a list around all the instead somehow attaching it to the a good chance several of these applications may be running at and using the same each application needs its own object and all the dlls etc loaded by that application need to use that list rember that one dll may be loaded by multiple list must be destroyed after every other global and static variable in so the objects left in the list when its destructed are ones that truley were not correctly then will simply add a breakpoint to the destructor so i can look through any unallocated objects in the debugging memory leaks in reference counting

handles this there is an operation to get immediate and a operations to get all would you consider that as an summarize the navigation functions each correspond to an axis type in xpath if the navigation function selects the axis name is if the navigation function selects the axis name is used with node there are functions and correspond to descendants returning either an xelement or an exception case is not surprisingly the most used the children in this is the axis used if no axis is for the navigation functions are not and but rather and is a subtype of include things like html but also html cdata or xelements are a type of but refer specifically to html xelements therefore have a tag and support the navigation its not as easy to chain navigations in as it is the problem is that navigation functions return collection while the navigation functions are applied to consider the xpath expression which selects a table tag as an immediate child then any descendant table data i think this would look like or allows one to call the navigation functions on a the equivalent to the above looks something like

have a pool of threads which are fed tasks from a a small number of threads are able to keep the queue a particularly large burst of events will keep the queue size above zero for some but not for concern is regarding events that are duplicates or carry data that obsoletes previous during times of high such events can coexists in the queue for a short period of i would like to be able to conflate these so that i can reduce time spent doing wasted is a good way to conflate such a i could conflate at insertion time by iterating from back to head and searching for a candidate to however this seems too if you have code or library please keep in mind that i am using good method for conflating queue

have a wrapper project i created to talk to a 3rd party another lets call it it uses this api by adding the wrapper project as a project reference so that it can use various classes to call api methods via httprequest i need to do a bulk update by calling a wrapper class called and loop through each of the records in our database and using some of the fields from each of those records make an api call to update each is i want to create like a in my wrapper problem is that it would have to take a generic list of objects into the this generic list of objects records pulling from our the resides in since it represents the table and instance of each record for that table in my if i send a generic list of those objects to my class that does the looping and sending of the request to update all those records in the generic just introduced a circular reference because is referencing and then is referencing a class in because taking in a list of generic object instances that represent records in our i guess how is the best way to keep a circular reference from i guess i could instead create the bulkupdate logic in and that jsut referencing the and doing the loop in some class i create in and only using the class from our wrapper project and not sending any of the mybusinesslayer classes to that wrapper hope this makes circular

have an application that stores a sparse this matrix has entries that mostly exist around the main diagonal of the i was wondering if there were any efficient algorithms existing that can efficiently handle sparse matrices of this this would be a generic implementation where each matrix entry can be a in response to a i say mostly around the main diagonal i mean that the characteristics of most of the matrices will be that most entries are clustered off of the main diagonal but there could be zeroes close to the diagonal and there could be values far out from the i want something efficient for cases will i be using this i need to be able to have efficient access to all values in a row or all values in a the values stored would be boolean an example would all true values in a foreach column a true appears in set all the entries of the column to all false values in a set the entry to was all done with linked lists previously but was very confusing to i was hoping that with a sparse matrix i could improve the algorithm but finding the type of sparse matrix algorithm has proved thanks for the responses thus far way to store a sparse matrix in	
have an application with an infopath forms delivering infopath forms to the browser using infopath forms rather than save the forms in we submit the xml form data to a web which saves the data as an xml data type in sql server this is working and we have no issues loading the xml data back into the infopath issue comes when we try to load old data from version 1 of the into a new version of the form this new version of the form has a new textbox for because the v2 field does not exist in the v1 they are visible on the v2 but are disabled and cannot be question is how do we load v1 xml data into v2 and have the user be able to complete those fields which are now present in v2 of the behaviour is possible using infopath forms server and forms stored in a form if you update the form you can open old forms in the new see the new and can save data in the new we need to know how to do it programmatically when the form xml data is stored in sql rather than a form old xml data into new version of infopath	
have an existing and working database created from hbm mapping want to create some new tables for an optional option is that these new tables always exist but we would prefer for the tables and pojos to only be created on issue is that these have dependancies on existing i have created a mapping file but i can only get it to work if it creates commands for the existing tables as well as the new with their pojos as i avoid this existing for group appearing in the creation the example below group is an existing ant target to generate this is below and only works if the dependant objects are the dependant reference to group then i get the schema text an association from the table refers to an unmapped mapping file with dependancies to existing

have an online game where i record lots of gameplay these stats tables get large very and i have to be careful because simply recording more stats can cause the performance to get pretty once the table gets big which a very good is to keep the stats tables i have an automatic process that creates a new table every 24 preventing the performance from getting too but my solution is ugly and is a sort of of stats i use innodb and have set up a couple of indexes to improve and then i just keep 30 of these tables around one is 24 so saving a month of every 24 my automated process deletes the then renames all the numbered tables to have a higher and then it creates a blank table called simply this is the where stats are actively being recorded tables basically record every transaction between every player and every other player in the game that they interact thus an exponential explosion of when a new transaction it checks to see if there is already a row for the transactions between these two players during that if there it updates the row with changes to their it creates a new a pair of players who interact 1000 times in a day and a pair who interact just a single time will both have just a single row in the table for that each action on the database involves a select and then either an update or an so it is pretty even between reads and writes as currently the reading of data in a larger for analysis of stats and multiple players is done very relative to the single updates and there are about rows created per know this could be i easily reduce the amount of data but concerned about and i could increase performance even more by having a new table created every 4 for but then i have to mess with 180 i could make it simpler by just using one and then everything comes to a screeching that i do need to update rows in these so i use something like the archive storage but i only need to insert or update on the stats is also the minor issue that when the daily rotation process any queries coming in at that moment may be it is in the process of renaming all tables and creating a new new entries may losing a few inserts is not a big but a solution where this error or could be done would be for any ideas that might idea for of

have created a assembly that is exposed to com according to the exceptional article and deploy a com by phil everything works fine in the sense that the assembly is properly registered for and compiled com code can call it without any only odd thing is that developing against the assembly when using vb or vba requires that the programmer to the exact file location of the associated after which everything works just that the class library is not showing up directly within the references dialog so you must browse to the file the com interop aspects do work i would think that there must be some setting that would make the library directly visible within the references dialog for vb and anyone know what this setting would or should this be happening automatically for me just by having it thanks in advance for any answer question about whether using the using a setup and not explicitly using the assembly is being correctly which can be seen by the fact that within the key correctly holds the full path to the compiled com components execute against this dll just only when developing against it using vb or vba that they do not appear within the references dialog i therefore need to to the correct file after which it works further it appears although the class guids are being registered my file is not being i have no idea why registering the file should put some registry entries for the interface on which my class is based at but this is not strange that this lack of registration does not seem to affect the ability to other than its discoverability within and references properties for my file within the setup project do seem to be the property is set to and the property is set to i am puzzled as to why this would not be successfully installed on the target it turns out that the setup project is being built despite it reporting that the is actually a build warning a not an being reported that it as to create registration information for file name since this was a and not an the compile was stating and the error list was opening this it seems that this can be an issue when attempting to create a setup project when vista is your development as described typelib registration problem in vs2008 setup is a somewhat manual fix described unable to create registration information for file named have not tried the fix but i will tomorrow and report back if this solves did not work out so it seems that running as suggested in that article does not work when running on since regcap is actually run internally by the setup project itself on creating the this is not terribly in the setup project was almost certainly failing because the regcap command that it was calling was so calling regcap directly is of no bottom line is that this is simply a bug when attempting to create a setup package on perhaps it is a combination of visual studio 2008 and not attempting the same exact approach is to create a setup project on visual studio 2005 running on windows xp had absolutely no problems very well may be fixes to get this running right on vista visual studio but i could not track it much more efficient for me was to build using visual studio 2005 on windows xp to generate the com registration and then to import them into my visual studio 2008 setup these can be exported as files via regasm using a switch against the dll and using regcap on against the since my com interfaces will not be i only have to do this this issue in visual studio 2008 when running on vista will be corrected at some but if hopefully this post will be of some value to someone else who finds him or herself in the same to get com server for excel written in installed and registered in automation servers add a project to the vb6 references

have nested sortable list that can have items dynamically added or removed and can be nested on a new ul element is injected into whatever li element is selected to be the the initial state of the list is something like the using mootools to do the etc and it works but what having trouble doing is resetting the position text correctly on every css selector i try to use also includes of the children rather than just the li elements that belong in the list and not any belonging to assume that except for and each li element in all lists is identical to all is there a selector for getting only the immediate is there another way to do tried some child selectors like the ones will select li are a child of a not just the does the same is the function that currently having run when an item is dropped handle the which works just updating the note that it is also mootools drop var poscount a changing any item order on the main level will renumber everything even the changing any item on a sublist will give the correct numbers for that but cause the parent lists to incorrectly count all child li elements in i feel like this is an ugly but it drop var ulcount var elid var poscount selector for targeting only immediate children and not other identical

i am not a and none of this should be taken as legal should probably note that nmap considers a product that parses its output to be a derived according to licensing in the and thus fall under the gpl licensing the does not define what a derived work instead letting that be up to the courts and according to definitions in copyright the usual interpretation is that any form of other than linking to system libraries included in the operating makes the linked work a derived while separate process that talk over pipes or the network are not necessarily derived though as mentioned in the the semantics of the communication are intimate exchanging complex internal data that too could be a basis to consider the two parts as combined into a larger that seems to be the interpretation that the nmap developers are assuming that you need to worry about the you probably want to look at the for in for xml output and for if you need more control over what nmap you should look into the scripting a lua scripting engine in nmap that gives you all kinds of

i needed to compare a suggested pattern for idisposable and object finalization with the one we which we have used the one a fair but after looking it the two side by side i had a number of questions about the here is the class implements private disposedvalue as boolean false to detect redundant protected overridable sub disposing as if not if disposing free managed resources when explicitly end free shared unmanaged end end idisposable support this code added by visual basic to correctly implement the disposable public sub implements do not change this put cleanup code in disposing as end is called during gc without being explicitly called first then and the code within will never execute to free the managed in them remaining in memory until the next gc why these be explicitly doing so free more memory on the first gc pass and not leave unneeded objects in memory until the next the ide generate the call when overriding on an idisposable would the gc know to call and ensure that it is the implementation and not a custom implementation which uses the bool parameter in a different as be an interface member if the gc tests for its existence and uses it in a manner that assumes a certain implementation in the presence of both and as why would the gc ever opt to call the i am confused by the supposed added value of having an extended that executes when is called opposed to having a common path that is executed regardless of whether or not was called while i can appreciate that it is provided with good intentions i see how it does anything other than delay the actual release of managed resources if called in essence it seems to only work to make the managed resources unreachable in the object orphaning them until the 2nd gc run rather than freeing them at a point where they are known to be no longer does implement the idisposable interface with a as

i think we all agree that what happens with the following code is depending on what is pointer could be all sorts of different and so performing an unconditional on it is assume that we are indeed passing an array arr new return question in this case where the pointer an who is it that knows i from the point of it has no idea whether or not is an array pointer versus a pointer to a single it even know whether was dynamically if i do the following num new return os is smart enough to only delete one int and not go on some type of by deleting the rest of the memory beyond that point that with and a string it will keep going until it hits whose job is it to remember these does the os keep some type of record in the i realise that i started this post by saying that what happens is but the fact the scenario so therefore in the practical world is does know an	
i think we are all guilty of forgetting just who it is that we develop our applications it always easy as a developer to be able to take a step back and have a look at your application as a user might do this is why big companies employee hundreds of people to do this for them and they always get it is a massive subject but it is defiantly something that all developers need to keep in it has taken me a long time to learn this but when tackling any development task i always try to think about how my users are going to interact with what i am this will make a difference to all levels of your would suggest reading make me think by steve this book take you an age to read and it puts across some fantastic ideas that can help you to develop applications that are much easier to use and always find that once i have thought about the user experience the decisions about what my web pages are going to do and how they are going to interact are much easier to	
i think whoever creates the object should be responsible for in this acontainer creates so it should be disposed when acontainer for some you think that somedisposableobject should live longer than acontainer i can only think of the following somedisposableobject in which case the gc will take care of it for somedisposableobject a reference to acontainer winforms controls and parent as long as somedisposableobject is so is prevent the gc from disposing but if someone calls dispose manually dispose say somedisposableobject as a say that makes it that the client is responsible for in though not really sure the design makes after you seem to be expecting client code c new d do something with seems like broken client code to violating law of and plain common sense to

i was hooking into but this took too long as it fire until firefox has loaded the dom tree for the page and any of its was similarly slow because it requires the page to fully load as well as all its after going through as well as setting up xpcom for and a few i ultimately settled on as that seems to fire even when the html page has no or has an equivalent to the previous remember why i settled on but i believe it was because it was the best fit for my needs which the quickest way to get the navigated url without waiting for anything to load while simultaneously firing on every conceivable way a new page is new page and all only catch is that you will need to add code to manually look up the url in your overlay startup as unless you before ff starts loading the first page on new you will have added your event listener too late to reliably catch that initial page is because a isolated instance of your is loaded every time firefox opens a new

implementing idisposable most including the framework suggest including a bool member in order to safely allow multiple calls to as well as to throw when works fine for a single when you subclass from your disposable and a subclass contains its own native resources and unique things get a little bit most samples show how to override but do not go beyond that to handling are two questions that i have in this subclass and the base class both need to be able to track the state of there are a couple of main options i know of declare private bool in both each class tracks its own and throws as use protected bool disposed private instead of a this would let the subclass check the disposed provide some protected helper method to check the disposed and throw by pulling the current type name via reflection if the object is advantages as disadvantages i see to each by option this to me since it contains duplicated but seems to work i often use this when subclassing other this takes out the duplicated but is not the way the design guidelines books are this is what i typically since it keeps it a single point for this seems like the cleanest option to but appear in standard it may be a little less expected of an approach than others from users of the at one point or have tried using all three of these i would like to know advantages and disadvantages to the three as well as any other ideas for a better way to handle what choice would you make in handling and throwing the what do you use for the name i know the method call new is a comment this from a microsoft employee suggesting that implementing the concrete full name is the appropriate the third option this would be the only meaningful if the class implements the throwing you could potentially return the name of the class that defines the method that was the base class could return the base not the concrete think this is a good idea but i ran into this on some code written by somebody are there advantages or disadvantages to having the name of the class implementing the method objectdisposedexception correctly in an idisposable class

is a complex there are infinitely many ways to interpolate a set of and this assuming that you truly do wish to do and not smoothing of any interpolant reproduces the original data points and of the nature of this problem makes things more are several common schemes for interpolation of scattered data in for those who have access to a very nice paper is available data tests of some mathematics of the most common method used is based on a triangulation of your merely build a triangulation of the domain from your data then any point inside the convex hull of the data must lie inside exactly one of the or it will be on a shared this allows you to interpolate linearly inside the if you are using then the function griddata is available for this express problem when trying to populate a complete rectangular image from scattered points is that very likely the data does not extend to the 4 corners of the in that a triangulation based scheme will since the corners of the array do not lie inside the convex hull of the scattered an alternative then is to use basis abbreviated there are many such schemes to be including when used by the geostatistics inpainting is the name for a scheme of interpolation where elements are given in an but where there are missing the name obviously refers to that done by an art conservator who needs to repair a tear or rip in a valuable piece of idea behind inpainting is typically to formulate a boundary value that define a partial differential equation on the region where there is a using the known boundary fill in the hole by solving the pde for the unknown this can be computationally intensive if there are a huge number of unknown since it typically requires the solution of at least a massive sparse system of linear if the pde is a nonlinear then it becomes a more intensive problem a reasonably good choice for the pde is the which results in a linear system that extrapolates i can offer a solution for a matlab choices for the pde may come from nonlinear once such is the it is well suited to modeling the types of surfaces typically but it is also more difficult to deal as in many facets of you get what you pay

is detailed of why is both more efficient and less biased than from the sun forums post that gili linked uses uses twice to generate a double that has approximately uniformly distributed bits in its so it is uniformly distributed in the range 0 to uses less than twice on it uses it and if the value obtained is above the highest multiple of n below it tries otherwise is returns the value modulo n prevents the values above the highest multiple of n below skewing the so returning a value which is uniformly distributed in the range 0 to to scaling by the output of is one of possible values drawn from a uniform by 6 alter the number of possible and casting to an int then forces these values into one of six each bucket corresponding to ranges encompassing either 1501199875790165 or 1501199875790166 of the possible values 6 is not a disvisor of this means that for a sufficient number of dice rolls a die with a sufficiently large number of the die will show itself to be biased towards the larger will be waiting a very long time rolling dice for this effect to show also requires about twice the processing and is subject to

is very misleading and it seems to me that the author does understand the finer just that he appears to want to the key point that shows the flaw in argument is the operator standard defines that the above function has the following intentionally performs no other restate that this function performs no other this is very as it is the key to what placement new it is used to call the constructor for the and all it notice explicitly that the parameter is not even those without to summarise my everything that does in c can be done in using the only difference is that if you have non aggregate types that need to have their destructors and constructors then you need to call those constructor and such types do not explicitly exist in and so using the argument that does it is not if you have a struct in that has a special function which must be called with a corresponding then all points made by the author apply equally to that struct as they do to a some of his points implement multiple the compiler must actually change the values of pointers during some it know which value you eventually want when converting to a void no ordinary function can perform the role of malloc in is no suitable return is not again performs the role of a1 a2 b public public a2 foo void v new b b new placement new calls the constructor for delete v new int i delete i mention we need placement new to call the constructor for in the case of we can cast from to without a although again using placement new would improve type point he makes is about alignment returned by new will not necessarily meet the alignment requirements of a struct standard under pointer returned shall be suitably aligned so that it can be converted to pointer of any complete object type and then used to access the object or array in the storage allocated the storage is explicitly deallocated by a call to a corresponding deallocation to me appears pretty specialized allocators the author describes potential problems that you might you need to use the allocator as an argument to any types which allocate memory themselves and the constructed objects will need to have their destructors called how is this different to passing the allocator object through to an call for a c calling the in you can easily create a special kind of smart call it which we can define to call the destructor explicitly when it goes out of as a result we could if t arena foo new must be pfp new automatically last point i want to comment on is the comes with a operator defined as void void return noted not just implemented this way but it is required to be so by the obj be a class with a suppose you have sizeof bytes of memory somewhere and would like to construct 10 objects of type obj at that defines sizeof to be 10 sizeof can you do so with this placement operator for the following code would seem to do void return new serious this code is in there is no guarantee that the argument passed to operator really corresponds to the size of the array being as he highlights by supplying the the size argument is not used in the allocation the allocation function does and so the only affect of the above placement expression is to call the constructor for the 10 array elements as you would are other issues with this but not the one the author

is what basically is free software which lets you publish and obtain information on the internet without fear of to achieve this the network is entirely decentralized and publishers and consumers of information are without anonymity there can never be true freedom of and without decentralization the network will be vulnerable to contribute to the network by giving bandwidth and a portion of their hard drive the for storing unlike other file sharing freenet does not let the user control what is stored in the data files are kept or deleted depending on how popular they with the least popular being discarded to make way for newer or more popular files in the data store are encrypted to reduce the likelihood of prosecution by persons wishing to censor freenet biggest problem is that both in transfer speed and even if you can get lots of people with decent upload still never be as quick a dedicated servers or the speed is fine for what freenet is data without fear of but not for hosting your bigger problem is the content has to be static which rules out use for a majority of to serve dynamic data each peer would have to execute code and would probably have to retrieve data from a database would be another big again because of the think is about as close to p2p as see for the time

jon much of this assumes the risk of seeming comments like these just bother to write programs correctly is difficult and time should be avoided is practically impossible to write software that does anything significant without leveraging threads in some if you are on open your task enable the thread count and you can probably count on one hand the number of processes that are using a single one should not simply use threads for the sake of using threads nor should it be done but i believe these cliches are used too i had to boil multithreaded programming down for the true i would say jumping into first understand that the the class boundary is not the same as a thread for if a callback method on your class is called by another thread the asynccallback delegate to the understand that the callback executes that other so even though the callback occurs on the same you still have to synchronize access to the members of the object within the callback threads and classes are it is important to understand this what data needs to be shared between once you have defined the shared try to consolidate it into a single class if the places where the shared data can be written and if you can get this down to one place for writing and one place for you will be doing yourself a tremendous this is not always but it is a nice goal to shoot make sure you synchronize access to the shared data using the monitor class or the lock use a single object to synchronize your shared data regardless of how many different shared fields there this will simplify it may also overly constrain things in which you may need a synchronization object for each shared and at this using immutable classes becomes you have one thread that needs to signal another i would strongly recommend using the manualresetevent class to do this instead of using sum i would say that threading is not but it can be a properly threaded application will be more and your users will be most is nothing about asynchronous the various method in if these techniques make it easier to accomplish various tasks in a threaded if you have a gui application that does any heavy or it is practically impossible to make the responsive to the user without leveraging threads behind the the techniques i mentioned above make this possible and are a breeze to it is important to understand the to be i simply believe we do especially younger a disservice when we talk about how multithreaded programming is or how threads be comments like these oversimplify the problem and exaggerate the myth when the truth is that threading has never been there are legitimate reasons to use and cliches like this just seem counterproductive to

keys will need absolute uniqueness not high probability of i would suggest using guids instead of hashes for your keys for generate the hash as a quick look up mechanism you can have a index on this but in the case of collision have to compare the actual data to make sure they are the in synchronizing your databases you can check the hash using the and if you find a then resolve whether the data is the same thus the guids needs to be if there is no then simply update whichever database needs the missing entry and insert using the guid from the other see little point in creating your own hash of hashes to save if you already have the other just use them if just use a standard hash function like md5 or sha1 and store the resulting

know how authoritative this is but i found it seem good to have a lot of connections to this seems to be bad for the web and most applications that have more than a few having a hard time thinking of what sqlite would be used for when you need that many every program i can think of needs lots of them so what would i use a database for that allow that many i thought about prototypes but why would i use that when i can just connect to a larger embedded apps thanks i look at the page recommended below but an confused about appropriate uses for sqlite it where sqlite works usually will work great as the database engine for low to medium traffic websites is to of all the amount of web traffic that sqlite can handle of on how heavily the website uses its generally any site that gets fewer than 100k should work fine with the 100k figure is a conservative not a hard upper sqlite has been demonstrated to work with 10 times that amount of where another rdbms may work you have many client programs accessing a common database over a you should consider using a database engine instead of sqlite will work over a network but because of the latency associated with most network performance will not be the file locking logic of many network filesystems implementation contains bugs both unix and if file locking does not work like it it might be possible for two or more client programs to modify the same part of the same database at the same resulting in database because this problem results from bugs in the underlying filesystem there is nothing sqlite can do to prevent good rule of thumb is that you should avoid using sqlite in situations where the same database will be accessed simultaneously from many computers over a network going to show my ignorance here but what is the difference between these is sqlite used

know kinda subjective if you were to put yourself in my shoes would you invest the time in want to write a web app which deals securely with relatively modest amounts of peoples private a few thousand records of a few kb each but stuff that needs to be kept phone numbers done several web projects in and have handy though it is i really like php and want to do another large project in such i figure best learn something new and so i am considering 2 options happily entertain others if you have having terrible trouble deciding they both look quite involved so rather than just jump in and potentially waste days getting up to speed enough on both of them to make an informed choice i thought come here and canvas some the two options considering of the python web turbogears seems well of all the languages i ever tried python is by far and away my loads of frameworks to choose from and i have done quite a lot of non web python coding over the last few loads to choose from so hard to need to run single server or which i like the sound what i do like is the notion of process separation and if one users account is compromised it gives an attacker no leverage against the rest of the not clear to what extent a python solution would handle it as a seaside which i guess runs on a squeak app from what heard it would permit good compartmentalization of users as each would have their own little private vm independent of all the systems other users which sounds wonderful from a scaling and redundancy not done any smalltalk since uni 15 years back and i never dug too deep into it i see much entry level help for seaside or that many projects using i suspect setting a server up to run it is hard for the same reason not because inherently hard but just cause there will be less help online and a presumption you are already rather au fait with what do people would i be able to efficiently get the kind of strong separation and compartmentalization after with a python is seaside as good as i think in terms of insulating users from each might i be better security sticking to the languages most familiar with so i make any n00b mistakes or will seaside be worth worth scaling the learning curve and prove more comprehensible and maintainable in the long at the end of the day not a life or death decision and i can always bail if i start with one and then hate it so pls nobody get all holy language war and start flaming for any replies this should i learn seaside or a python

little background designing an application that uses a architecture consisting server which loads potentially developed by other client which loads corresponding modules potentially developed by those other each client module corresponds with a server client side communicates with the server side for general and as well as module specific this i think that means client talks to client modules talk to server is and client side is deployment scenario introduces the potential to upgrade the any the and any module being able to using mismatched versions is therefore concerned about versioning thinking so windows service for the for the server to load and communicate with the server modules will give us the greatest flexibility in terms of version compatability between server and server server and each server module vend wcf services for communication to the client communication between the server and a server or between two server modules use the addin advantage of this is that a module can expose a different interface within the server and outside the client uses to and communicate with the client communications with client modules is via the addin communications from the client and from client modules to the server side are via maximum each module will run in a separate the system has modest performance so marshalling and crossing process boundaries is not expected to be a performance requirement is basically summed up get in the way of the other parts of the system not described questions are around the idea of having two different communication and versioning models to work with which will be an added burden on our seems quite but also a little also unsure of commitment to it in the on the other not thrilled with versioning i have a feeling that it would be possible to implement the system within but being fairly new to both i would have no idea of where to am i on the right track am i doing this the hard are there gotchas i need to be aware of on this architecture using wcf and

lot of configuration in guice is via the a great deal of complexity in projects comes from a big number of project java xml properties guice tries to remove a part of this complexity by not using config your application is easy at compile most likely you will only need to edit your module for most classes handeled by you will need no config at but only in the right places you will only need to configure anything when you have two different implementations of the same interface or when you want to inject classes from external libraries using provider

lower level why are you doing approach is widely used in java but hardly ever used in and is not a preferred approach you simply do not need it as libraries will not throw exceptions the way java library calls and if you are writing your own libraries you should not expect callers will naturally think to look for exceptions to convention most widely used and understood is that of a delegate that has an error method or perhaps notifications for more general failures that you need to pass up through multiple levels of that approach might be more widely used in the java world if there were a simple notification system the way cocoa has it set delegate approach has the same documenting property as declaring an exception in java they are just different approaches but generally better to use an approach more suited to the language at hand unless a very compelling reason to do

made some changes and commited them version and found out that they introduced new bugs to my program some minutes so i switched to some of the files to an older version to get some of the files back to version 1 on my local since then i have made a lot of changes i want to and i have used commit to get my local changes on the version i have locally is exactly what i want to be on the repository as head even though some of the files are still officially on i assume i should be using svn merge in some but not really sure how to do any when i use it shows changes from the local version to the rep i could do but then i would have a version locally so what i want is some kind of forced that just says is the newest when doing svn reports that there are no thanks to neil butterworth for the what i finally i should just have used but i was dumb enough to do an update without really thinking about what i was of everything was then really messed up beyond so what i finally did was to export the project to a new obviously not the way you should do but i did not want to mess with this stuff any in the end i had to get back to making actual progress on the actual i know that i do stuff like that when working in a bigger but to force your local version as newest on

making a distinction between member and free functions when i was thinking about the but i now see that this was a it now seems to me that structs should only rarely have member it is pretty clear that everything in a struct should be there is generally no point in having struct member functions because any function can change the data in the a member function on a struct would be a convenience rather than a only exceptions would be things required to be member functions for some other purpose constructors for initialising comparisons for use with a things used by class and struct should be seen as opposites a class exposes functions and hides whereas a struct exposes data and allows you to hide back to the byte swapping int void int void i swap void s s makes sense when the data and some functions do not always strongly belong byte swapping would only be of interest to the network system but higher level functions can still use the struct without even knowing about low level stuff like byte benefit in this case is that the related byte swapping operations are all kept together in the same

marc what the specification the reason this is a good thing is that there are some valid reasons to leave a member uninitialized rather than a local whose lifetime is bounded by the method it is mostly only ever want this for performance if the variable is expensive to and should only be initialized under specific usage for my avoid uninitialized members until my back was truly against the local it is also much easier to detect whether all code paths are likely to lead to whereas there are no good heuristics to determine whether all code paths across the entire programme guarantee initialization before a completely correct answer is in both as all cs students should

method i posted above is not a good way to resolve the it is confirmed by a insider that it is a bug in based on my finding he does not recommend my removing html elements which i think for the chart and as a think his suggestion is the chart and legend are created by my case of html page may not reveal all the dom objects to be removed just for the clean some dom objects in cache may be left uncleaned behind for in js i added two divs under an empty one for chart and one for apis add svg nodes under the chart div and converted legend div to a in addition to several invisible divs are created outside my initial empty this cleaning up method would left some mess or cause unpredictable further my method may be broken in the future of new or updated apis bugs as i am new to started to write some testing codes by its apis in the last week based on i am not sure if provides any way to clean up charts and i think that would be best way or apis to do it if my above solution works fine for my deleting all the chidlren nodesunder an empty you should be aware the potential the demo i can find out so are example codes to create or add new charts to a web there is no as far as i can for manipulating or simply refreshing if the data series are coming from web services or it would be a need just to update an area of here is an example of html page up curve chart pie chart div area for chart bar chart refresh chart with changes options available to create chart in one div i think i do have a need to clean up the div if there is any chart generated looking at the codes how a chart and a legend are created by nodedivforchart and nodedivforlegend are div var chart1 new var legend1 new guess is that chart1 and legend1 are dom instances or not sure if there is any way to destroy those instances as a way to clean up chart and

not entirely sure how to post this but here have a web app that has a list of sortable i sort them ajax style using that works like a i can drag and drop the items till my heart is the same there is a button that allows for the creation of new items on my this is also ajaxified and works for the most the new item appears on my list and firebug shows that the code being rendered is exactly the same as the other list oh and it is contained in the correct problem is that the new item is not i do anything with it unless i refresh the any ideas why this is the case or how i can get around really like to solve tried to paste code in but quite make it so i went with here is the code for a page with 2 sortable this is a fresh load and everything works as this i have clicked the button that creates a new but not so the first 2 sections are but the new one is using ruby and rails to do the ajaxing here and not very familiar with how it should but i believe this behavior comes from and maybe adding item to sortable

not sure why of the answers mention reflection good polymorphism works just fine for getting the runtime type name is easy just only somewhat tricky part is maintaining unique counters per been discussed before on so but i find a link the bottom is that you can either generics or maintain a to keep generic version works because each different type parameter creates a different generic class so they each have different static class where t private static int counter private static object synclock new protected lock public string name get return private string blur sharpen no need to override anything in the derived but you do have to make sure your inherited is correct or share i also used a lock to synchronize access to counter assuming create instances from more than 1 you like the generic then a works just as class command private static counter new private static object synclock new protected type t lock if public string name get return private string blur command sharpen command be creating of probably profile both and check memory i particularly care for the generic approach since easy to screw up and pass the wrong type parameter but i suspect memory usage is a bit if going to create have to worry about that being not sure why you just maintain an index addressable collection and reference them by index like

on march two years after i originally answered this question i come back to see that it has pretty much turned into a big i feel about time i come back to it and make my answer truly correct since it is the most upvoted the answer is wrong as it is not what the original poster asked for it is correct that it is possible to reset a form using the native but this question is trying to clear a form off of remembered values that would remain in the form if you reset it this this is why a reset is i assume most people ended up in this question from a google search and are truly looking for the but it does not work for the specific case the op is talking answer was not use answer might work for a lot of including for the but as pointed out in the comments and in other will clear elements from any value more answer not to by by the selectors by themselves is considered bad practice by jquery as they end up evaluating to which makes it take much longer than it i do prefer the whitelist approach and wish i had used it in my original by specifying the part of the plus the cache of the form this should make it the best performing answer answer might still have some flaws if default for select elements is not an option that has a blank but it is certainly as generic as it is going to get and this would need to be handled on a

opinion is and would be the best of the three for development that is web doubt anyone writes new web apps in c or it was done 10 years and likely a lot of legacy code still in but not particularly well there appear to be as much tool and they probably have a small active community that does web development perhaps for web server i wrote many website com objects back in the but is far more productive that no compelling reason to code c or this unless you need do still write if but typically for a small problem communicating from via to old doing some things that are downright clumsy in were a breeze to create a com object as a nice thing with is that you can also easily transfer into writing windows and console apps and stay in with mono also not limited to windows you may be limited to which libraries you this is all from a if you asked about embedded devices say c or you could argue none of these are suited for web but is pretty it works there are heaps of online a huge and free dev from a picking only one of and c as as a general better to stick with

php does not support method overloading the way you have experienced in other say but you can have method overloading in but the definition method is you want to have different functionality for a given with different set of parameters in you can do something like myclass public function is a function that returns an the number of parameters passed to the if 1 else protected function code protected function code could be cleaner but this is just a supports inheritance and so you can have polymorphism using you can have an interface like mybackupinterface saves the data on a reliable public function public function mybackupabstract implements mybackupinterface protected public function there is no abstract modifier in so avoid this class to be used in other public function throw new class is you can not instantiate backuptodisk extends mybackupabstract protected implement other methods public function is a function to save a string into a backuptowebservice extends mybackupabstract protected implement other methods public function suppose is implemented in the in your you might use it like some code to populate new new as are php is not strong typed we never mentioned that any of your would be a or but that would not stop us from having the nature of polymorphism which is different functionality over using the same

really need to understand forms and css to get i say forms as this will give you the round trip needed to understanding the stateless nature of web further labour the i have interviewed many people who think you can only have one form on a page and can only have one submit button per this is all down to a lack of foundation for that recommend starting with a lot of web development is done with gone are the days where you do it yourself but my above point still you do need to be able to peep under the hood with some been doing web development for 12 years and started out with perl on solaris and since then also done java and more recently slowly falling for django in my private found over the years is that the inherent problems authentication are all the same but just handled so ultimately its down to you and your language plus a little of enlightened self interest when it comes to potential you should also become familiar with web servers and iis spring to http codes and mime types and encoding and as well as javascript browser platforms and good development practises such as using fiddler and so it also hurt to have a good idea of the image formats image css content caching and the depends on where you want to a pick django and clean language with cheap startup low cost ides and hosting your sites is very just a subjective

right in that every public method in a controller becomes a that being not necessarily a web an action could be a post of data and then redirect to another so page does not necessarily mean uses a lot of conventions to make things for every controller must end with so a set of user pages would be in a in the views each public method or action within the controller class becomes a web page within a folder that matches the prefix of the controller this a user so an action called within the controller class would point to the page within the user seems a little awkward to put all of those methods in one but it does a nice job of organizing like functionalities based on your

second part of the question is the most interesting one to i prefer to put within the classes that use when a logical place for even if used in other but that causes some problems with forward declarations we use heavily for in one recent project we had a class called with an embedded typedef called which made for very readable code an is very clear and but whenever we wanted to use the we had to include the declaration of the even if all we needed was the declaration of since no way i know to a type within a that we ended up doing it both we created a global and then to it that our code have to be not the prettiest but it got the job for the other use any special convention for the for we often use unlikely that ever change from a map to some other container but if is descriptive enough and conflict with an existing often use it generally bother creating typedefs for the since easy very to simply use or that we sometimes typedef them if the type name is so long that makes the code look too know of any better way to say but you probably know what i create different typedefs for each even if two of them define exactly the same they can change independent of one so having different type names for them simplifies any later it also makes for more readable in many

tell you much for sure without knowing the workload the statistical distribution of events over but in queue with multiple servers is at least as and usually so would be preferable to threads in most languages add complexity because of the need to avoid contention and duration processes can block processing for other things that could get done horseback guess is that having a single event with several server threads taking events off the be a little sure you use a data structure for the

that you use to declare the variable it is available to every function and all code in the global scope and beyond because without the the variable is created in the global your question if you want the variables created inside a function to exist beyond the life of a use a you could give the variable to some object accessible outside the function which has the job of storing a bunch of these you want the variable in javascript and therefore i assume on the to be accessible to your php back end have to send a request to your probably an ajax call if this execution part of submitting a

the answer you get will be off by a certain i have never heard of a timer function compensating for the average return because such a thing is nearly impossible to predict such things are usually implemented by simply reading a register in the hardware and returning the or a version of it scaled to the appropriate i lose sleep over the accepted way of keeping this overhead from affecting your measurements in any significant way is to use these timers for short you will time several or million executions of the same and divide by the number of executions to estimate the average such a thing is usually more useful than timing a single as it takes into account average cache os and so

the array is a specific size and all regular integers in your why not just use a simple integer for assume this is an instance variable of type nsinteger myarray do any other initialization that you return do whatever you objects your requirements call for a array all consisting of the primitive i think that the simple solutions are if the length of the array will never change you know the length at compile you can use an nsinteger array as your instance variable instead of a that way you have to deal with allocating the memory or freeing in that you will get a out array	
the as you call them are stored discontiguously in no real way to pull this off create an array of and store references to the indexes of the other array in that need to loop through all of the elements in your so probably not a better solution than any depending on how often you need to access the array by column it might be

the fact that you stated that there are no there are would recommend creating two tables for packet one to store or which is common to the packet it may define what data is the actual data stored in the second table would store the data for each with each combination representing a row in this for the following two table int primary destination sender int not table int primary int not null references packet int not data these two tables are making assumptions about the type and size of data being stored and exhaustive in what need to this fundamental structure will allow for packet formats and is a schema easily indexed adding an index on in would be a your application is then responsible for is unpacking the packet and storing it in your db in this then repacking from this point need tables that store the actual format of the something table int primary name not table int primary int not null references int not name not obviously simplified but it shows the basic you would have a single record in your table for each packet and one row in the for each field in a given this should give you most of the information you would need to be able to process an arbitrary chunk of binary data into the aforementioned packet storage

the first example you use a string to index the array which will be a hashtable the which is to access the value a is computed from the string to locate the value you this calculation takes second example is an array based on numbers which is arrays that use numbers will index the array according to that 0 is index 1 is index that is a very efficient way of accessing an no complex calculations are the index is just an offset from the start of the array to access the you only use then you should use not not a question of a question of how php will optimize your numbers are the speed differences are negligible when dealing with small sizes storing less than thanks paolo

the functional paradigm is highly effective for parallel really interesting thing i you to is that as as you think of map and reduce functions that everybody can they use you only have to one supergenius to write the hard to run map and reduce on a massively parallel array of and all the old code that used to fine when you just ran a loop works only a zillion times which means it can be used to huge problems in an repeat by abstracting the very concept of you implement looping any way you including implementing it in a that scales nicely with on can your programming language do	
the getting of the controllers and actions seems to me to be the relatively trivial the hard part is being able to get all the possible parameter values that you might want to show in the urls of your if you have a url pattern like then not going to be able to determine through reflection what the meaning of or the possible the best you can do is determine the system occurred to me as i was looking at this is that a sitemap is really just another view of your so one random thought i had was that if you inherit from a base controller in your and you have a method on that base controller that has to be actionresult you could create a which calls each of the other controllers in the solution and asks them for their and then renders them all together in one final sort of a composite though not a concept been added to this framework

the short design patterns will often increase the complexity of the they add extra abstractions in places they might not be strictly in the long term they reduce complexity because future enhancements and changes fit into the patterns in a simple without the these changes would be much more intrusive and complexity would likely be much for example a decorator the first time you use it will add complexity because now you have to define an interface for the object and create another class to add the this could likely be done with a simple property and be done when you get to 5 or 20 the complexity with a decorator is much less than with

the specific requirement to provide a library of objects shipped with the application a database system is probably not the right thing that springs to mind is that you probably want the file to be updatable you need to be able to drop and updated file into the application without changing the rest of the thing is that the data shipping is immutable for this purpose therefore you need the capabilities of a relational just to be able to access a particular model with adequate simplicity an xml file would do nicely as got good using that as a basis you can then choose to compress encrypt embed it as a resource in an assembly one were playing in if sqlite stores its data in a single file and if you have other reasons to need the capabilities of a db in you storage system then but want to think about the utility of the db to the app as a whole

think i should clarify how the compilation model first of you can write everything in a single file and inherit from whatever class you want to ultimately inherits from by specifying attribute you might want to omit and without a if you do you can still access the properties from the file that uses this the thing you use the class in the codebehind file of page it has by specifying the if you are using the website project model of visual you can access it from the file note that this would not work in web application project model as every file will be compiled ahead of the time to the in that even attribute help any strictly none of the attributes are you can always use the properties defined anywhere in or file included in a page in the file always to address the update to the from your source it seems you are using the website model note that i mentioned you cannot use the i agree this statement might have been a little what i wanted to note is that without a will choose a name for your user control class but that name is not while you use the generated not recommended at you should treat it pretty much like an anonymous type where you can use an instance but cannot mention a in your you are basically referencing an instance is constructed on the not the which is what you are saying is whatever you declare in in a web application will be visible to and what i was talking about is properties that you declare in in a those will not be visible to since compiled will generate the class defined by the attribute in the you should use there is one thing i forgot to in this you should somehow reference the in the either with a directive reference directive or with a directive register this will ensure that the build engine puts the generated class in the same assembly as

think it might differ if you are working on an internal software vs a external software internal software it will almost never be a problem to use a formally defined however for a product the version or release number is in most cases a commercial decision that does not reflect any technical or functional our company the in an numbering scheme is determined by the marketing boys and the z and the internal build number are determined by the department and track back into our revision control system and are related to the sprint in which it was produced is the scrum term for an addition formally defining some level of compatability between versions and releases could cause you to very rapidly move up or to hardly move at this might not reflect added

think looking at things in the wrong it is not the object which determines if you should use a hash but the manner in which you are accessing a common use of a hash is when using a lookup if your objects are strings and you want to check if they exist in a looking them up will the hash works by with the time would instead be which may not be hashes are ideal for use with dictionaries sets are also a useful way of representing an object without storing the object itself

think the question of whether or not to use code generation depends on what your goals are with the example of a data access layer is a good your problem with nhibernate is that you have to generate the domain classes if your domain classes map directly to the database then this is not a one of the strengths of nhibernate in this scenario is precisely that you can define your own domain and that they do not have to map precisely to the database that means you can tweak your db layer later on and the only code you have to change is the mapping if you used code probably have to tweak a lot more and the tweaks would not always be as straightforward as the tweaks to the mapping files would have

think what you are trying to say is that your string always end up in the same iteration of your if that is so there are basically two huge there is no way to prove that you will not get any misses here but it will lower the chance you know the max length of the string that you are looking for you can make two the first holds the current part that you just got and the other holds the the reason you need to know the length of the string is because the size of your buffers needs to be atleast the size of the second solution is by far the better one but it does rely on the knowledge of the max length of

to the swf documentation from you should be able to read the individual bytes of a swf to calculate the files file dimensions and version and file type or am using javascript to read in the individual bytes and converting them to human readable information but i am running into problems when it comes to file first question is does any one have a formula to convert from twips of a to it would seem that dividing by 20 would but i am not second question is has any one been able to get the file dimensions of a swf file using any i am using javascript but i would think that the byte order would be the same in any to read size of swf through	
token bucket is fairly simple to with a bucket with 5 if the bucket has less than 5 add time you want to send a if the bucket has take one token out and send the the in actual use an integer counter instead of real tokens and you can optimize out the every step by storing the question if the rate limit is fully reset each 8 then here is a with a at a time long ago at the start with the same the every seconds time you send a check if 8 seconds if fill the bucket it to 5 if there are tokens in the send the message set to should work for that actually written an irc bot using a strategy like this first its in not but here is some code to first part here handles adding tokens to the you can see the optimization of adding tokens based on time to last and then the last line clamps bucket contents to the maximum my bucket my my or is a data structure which is passed this is inside a method that runs routinely calculates when the next time have something to and sleeps either that long or until it gets network the next part of the method handles it is rather because messages have priorities associated with queue start with the ultimate my foreach my ultimate is we run ultimate no matter even it sends the bucket the first which is run no matter even if it gets our connection killed for used for extremely important like responding to the the rest of the continue to the other in order of for my while if continue last else my shift the bucket status is saved back to the data structure a bit later in the it first calculates how soon have more save you can the actual bucket handling code is very small about four the rest of the code is priority queue the bot has priority queues so that someone chatting with it prevent it from doing its important

unit tests should be reasonably the fewer the more likely your test is to target a specific feature and not mix testing for multiple features in the same does this mean that all tests should only have one but i would consider it a if i found several potentially testing multiple things in the same unit treat this like you would a code smell and refactor the test to refine it so that it only tests one even if it requires more than one doing an mvc project now and one of the tests that i write is that the correct view is rendered by the there may actually be several of these if different code paths may result in different this is how i define it being the correct the result is the correct type and has the correct this requires two but only testing one result as result might do something similar with the but i would not test that the model is correct in the same test as checking the view because these are different aspects of the behavior of the i could change the expected model or view and by putting it in a separate only those tests concerned with that feature of the method need to be

unless performance is an issue it sounds like this is most likely the sort of job that will run occasionally and maybe even scheduled outside work i would loop over the existing cpu is invariably cheaper than time and maintenance considerations should override efficiency unless there is an impact on the business by not doing either way you should document why you have adopted whichever approach you choose in the if you already have a documentation regime i would suggest setting up a simple documentation table within the database with sp name and descriptive because of the nature of stored defined functions keeping overview control over what functionality has been implemented where can be tricky unless some strategy is adopted and seen far too many databases where there is a mass of stored and no simple method of groking what functionality has been implemented version control and full documentation is to be applauded if your group supports but if that available then documenting the database inside itself is and a quick

with you are forced to use that or if your program has a structure some country them change that list thilos answer will be the best way to do if you combine it with the advice from hawtin you with a you are free to and if your application might get more then you might change your code to use a treeset this kind of collection sorts your entries just when they are no need to call countrynames new note on why i prefer the has some but important simply only one line worry about this list really sorted right becaude a treeset is always no matter what you cannot have duplicate depending on your situation this may be a pro or a if you need stick to your experienced programmer looks at and instantly is a sorted collection of strings without and i can be sure that this is true at every so much information in a short performance win in some if you use a and insert values very and the list may be read between those then you have to sort the list after every the set does the but does it much the right collection for the right task is a key to write short and bug free not as demonstrative in this because you just save one but stopped counting how often i see someone using a list when they want to ensure there are no and then build that functionality or even using two lists when you really need a get me using is not an error or a but there are many cases when the treeset is much

working copy is in a home if the svn server runs as a different say then the hook script will run as it makes sense that one user cannot modify or read another files unless the permission settings on the files are such that this is should not share working copies among multiple if you really then simply giving permission to each user is not you would also need to make sure that none of the users create files which are inaccessible to other to achieve that you would need to write wrapper scripts for the svn commands that set the proper or give all involved users the ability to act as one specific user through

would suggest running the process as a scheduled task if you and writing a service only if you need services are quite a bit more difficult to write and if running your process on a schedule of any much better off using the windows scheduler than attempting to build a scheduler of your own the windows task scheduler is more efficient than your scheduler will windows task scheduler offers a number of options that you almost certainly attempt to but may find useful later you build a have to recompile the program if you want to change the logic that determines what conditions to run the task if you use the you just flip some options and are done with trying to decide between the then obviously using the task scheduler is a viable and if using the task scheduler is a viable then building a service is almost certainly the wrong

you answered as to which platform take a stab at aix for need to have a look at the to get the specific cause but usually because aix has run out of shared memory has a total of 16 shared memory of which 7 are available for the the amount actually used by your database can be calculated with a formula too complicated for me to remember without looking it up in the troubleshooting a real possibility that a database will use 6 leaving just seen situations where that happens then a request happens at the same time as a stored these need a shared memory segment if the begins the stored procedure will fail as you are ways to fix this are to free up segments by doing one or more memory mapped the segment usage by the need that formula but i think it involves buffer heap sizes and lock off if not

you are using exception handlers for control you are being too general and as someone else you know something happened if you are handling processing in the but what essentially you are using the exception for an else if you are using it for control you know what possible state could then you can use an exception handler for unexpected for example when you have to use a or you have to catch everything in the ui to show a nice error message and log the if you do know what might go and you put an if statement or something to check for then you are just being allowing the exception handler to be the for stuff you know could happen is and it will come back to haunt you because you will be trying to fix a situation in your exception handler based on a possibly false you put logic in your exception handler to determine what exactly then you would be quite stupid for not putting that logic inside the try handlers are the last for when you run out of to stop something from going or things are beyond your ability to the server is down and times out and you prevent that exception from being having all the checks done up front shows what you know or expect will occur and makes it code should be clear in what would you rather

you both threads to see the results of changing the private or is it perfectly ok with you if both threads get the but when one thread changes a private the other thread see that why i in your you could take the object from cache and then clone or copy it before returning as a each thread would have its own copy of the and that copy would have the state that was in the cached object at the time they asked for no 2 threads would ever share the exact same because making a copy for each that fits your then you can avoid having to lock the object will need synchronization on the factory method itself though which you also need in your current careful with the idea of a if you have a graph of objects and you only do a shallow wind up with references that are still shared across forcing you to need synchronization this idea of makes best sense if the object is a very simple object without a lot of references to other

you have two that you want to ignore a file that changed and that you want to add a bunch of files to subversion at solve the first problem you should use the previous suggestion propedit enter the name of the file into the editor that comes up on the environment this will most likely be or nano by make sure to save your changes to this file or it solve the second just loop over the files in your working copy via svn add in a bash equivalent terminal emulator it add something already under version control and you can safely ignore the warnings it gives the better solution would be to write a quick script to check if something is in svn first and only add it if but i think for what doing it might be a waste of add the root directory of your project and after checking to make sure happy with the the commit command will find all your changes the ones in and send them off to your

you know that your code uses as you i would go for a trivial do not underestimate the power of the asterisk in vim as well a search of the word you have under your cursor in the albeit this is limited only to the file you are currently solution you could implement is to have a very good testsuite and then wrap the routine with a deprecation if you get the deprecation it means that the routine was so still used this works even for reflection but of course you can never be sure if you trigger the situation when your routine call is
