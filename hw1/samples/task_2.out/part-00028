40 years part is easy but to get a truly accurate decimal not sure how you translate the rest of the age into a decimal you see age is expressed in and the calculation that you have to deal with anniversary like if someone was born on january when are they 1 month the answer is march but in some years that is 28 days later and some years 29 days is a javascript implementation i did that tries to deal with i suppose the decimal could express the number of days since the most recent birthday anniversay divided by the number of days till the next birthday and if you wanted to get more precise you could do it in seconds using the same i think it is a poor representation of an we just usually represent an age like make sure your datetimes are in the same timezone for your

a 25 element array of pointers to a pointer to char is generally considered a so this declaration could be interpreted as an array of but the memory for storing those strings does not exist you would have to allocate those string pointers are 4 bytes on your this line would have the effect of allocating 25 x 4 100 when you use an array name without a it into a pointer to the first element of the when this line is points to 100 bytes of enough room enough to hold 100 characters that are read in 99 characters plus a terminating nul the compiler is not protecting you from storing those characters in the memory that was allocated for 25 passing the starting address of the array to the function the compiler knows this is probably wrong since is supposed to take a pointer to not at pointer to an array of char but it lets you do it anyway except for the the statement in reinterprets that pointer as a char and you get the correct others have it would be correct to change the one line to declares an array of 25

a codebase in which one particular text string occurs the string may be some kind of message for or an xml tag of these examples are usually accompanied by another repeated representing the message footer or the closing as the codebase you notice the string popping up more and more until the bell goes what to turns out all been taught the create a manifest constant or a static final string or depending on the thereby giving the common string a and replace all instances of the string by use of the even a name for this refactoring in martin replace magic number with symbolic duplication duplication in the repeated text of the but in the repeated use of the the resulting code still contains the original by hiding the string behind a my feeling is that made the code less readable right approach after using inline constant to put the original strings back into the code is to look at the context in which each of those strings chances are there will be only a small number of kinds of use of the string perhaps every time a reply message is for if the message has a header and a for look for ways to create an object that builds the with a hook to a function that supplies the message ninety percent of the time that kind of approach but on the odd occasion when it look for ways to encapsulate the string in a simple and then push the surrounding code onto that in either case the result after is that the string is present inline in the but the behavioural context in which that string exists now has a name hopefully a name that is also meaningful in the domain and the domain knowledge or policy represented by the associated code is no longer

a good practice to make the entire string lowercase first just to ensure	
a great fan of does your method need access to the state of the if the answer is no it is probably otherwise you consider making it a static then go for access to state is less just as it is a good idea to hide private members that are not needed by other it is a good idea to hide the state from members that need reduced access can mean less it makes threading easier as it is much easier to keep static members there is also a performance consideration as the runtime does not need to pass a reference to as a parameter for static course the downside is that if you ever find that your previously static method will have to access the state for some then you have to change now i understand that this can be a problem for public apis so if this is a public method in a public then perhaps you should think about the implications of this a never faced a situtation in the real world where this actually caused a but maybe just go for by all

a language like where many of the limitations on variable name length do not exist that were once in languages like c and and where the ide provides excellent support for determining the type of a hungarian notation is should be so names like can be replaced by and can be the important thing is to be consistent and to create code that is easy to read and maintain this is the goal of any naming convention so you should always decide what convention you use based on i feel that hungarian notation is not the most readable or the most maintainable because it can be too requires a certain amount of knowledge on what the prefixes and is not part of the language and hard to enforce and hard to detect when the name no longer matches the underlying i like to replace apps hungarian like by referencing for referencing the class name for static and no prefix for local and instead of system hungarian the type of a variable in the variable i prefer to describe what the variable is for such as and

answer is right on recommending you let the parallel nature of web requests handle much of your parallelism for you if the environment place had great success using the parallel extensions was in loading data from remote i had an app where need to fetch one piece of use some information from that to fetch 30 and return the i ran the first fetch then defined a future the parallel for each other request i included the little bit of processing i needed in the anonymous and did a on the array of very simple to and all the requests at least several of them at a run in parallel to fetch their especially since the latency for my calls was very high wait for about 1kb of this technique worked i even modified it to return an and used to wait for one of the futures to then yielded it from my allowing the caller to start processing the results from some of the requests before they all were

anyone have any suggestions for a best practice or preferred way of rolling back database transactions made from an integration test framework such as is our current we have a web project with a number of unit tests which work fine in our unit test environment each test inherits a parent class which opens a transaction in the and rolls back the transaction in the after each our unit test database is restored back to the original things change once we get to our integration our continuous integration server automatically compiles our commits and pushes them out to a test so that the server always runs on the most up to date also setup a selenium instance to automate user interaction with the the selenium tests basically communicate with an existing selenium and tell the server things a browser and go to enter text into form field with id assert new page contains text test is run in a similar manner to our vanilla unit but with an important any changes made by selenium are done in a completely different and therefore we we at roll them back in the test yet to come to a good solution for right now at a point where using a sqlcommand to execute a sql statement to backup the then at the end of the setting the database to single dropping the current and restoring the old copy this is less than because that effectively kills the application that was attached to the and requires us to yet again the this a problem that has been solved any advice would be database after integration

are 3 options for creating a chat and sockets for the frontend and a programming language for the for the recommend java or because they are multithreading and possible to do it with php php really do efficient multithreading and is generally not really suited for this is an option if you need high and probably not what looking ajax and this case all clients are constantly example ever 2 polling if something new has it feels strange because you only get responses at those it puts quite a strain on your server and you know an application uses this technique because the browser constantly this is a suboptimal ajax and works with and has long running scripts in the not the best but most of the time better than pulling and it works and is used in several well known chat this technique is sometimes called if you need a chat app for production install an existing programming chat applications is not you just want to learn start with a simple then try to program one using ajax and most probably need a tough i successfully implemented a very simple solution that works with text files for fun i certainly use it in is my but pretty not possible to create a chat app without a backend just frontend javascript you want to know how the data pushing is look at the source async multipart is what you want var httpreq new sync multipart sync wait until data false null event if 4 else error is called data not just once like in regular not using jquery or prototype so the a bit obese this is really old the server side 1 print print print print first part of request print 3 print print print second part of request print the if got a architecture like in the you need kind of external storage like databases or you could rely on memory by writing your own http server with but not recommend it for serious not really but probably a bit out of the scope of your question made a got everything mixed because been a long time i actually did something like here are the responses only work with mozilla browsers and therefore are of limited comet mean traditional singlepart but held an infinite loop and until there is data so the browser has 1 for every action the worst not one request every x even if nothing

assuming you are proficient at sql and schema there are very few instances where any abstraction layer that removes you from the sql statements will exceed the efficiency of writing the sql by more often than you will end up with suboptimal data no excuse for 100 queries just to generate one web if you are using the object oriented features of you will have good abstractions for collections of and the kinds of extended properties that map to sql but the important thing to keep in mind is to write the best abstracted objects you without regard to sql i write php code this i always find that able to map the data requirements for each web page to very very efficient sql queries if my schema is proper and my classes are and not only but my experience is that this is the simplest and fastest way to putting framework stuff in the middle between php classes and a good solid thin dal not embedded sql or dbms is the best example i can think of to illustrate the concept of

correct that you should not inherit from stl virtual functions would make them meaningfully larger the base size of vectors would jump from 12 to 16 bytes the implementation besides virtual functions are difficult to which can slow down the if you find yourself making an array of a million the difference adds up pretty can still get the effect you want by declaring the vector as a member variable in your itemlist and then thunking through any methods that you wish to itemlist item typedef item int int item offset return const return and so this is a fair amount of grunt but it will give you the effect you asked

designer adds some and other crap to the so you rely on page rendering can only guide it do the exact	
designing i often end up resorting to the following which i like as it results in lots of basic pattern code using the library hands an object to the the library then hands the object back to the calling the calling code is forced to cast the as the library hands back a generic code example library defines the following objects and function creatething procedure processthing doeverything calling code then uses the library by overriding the objects and calling as follows x xsum function creatething procedure processthing result xsum xsum as is the the caller is forced to cast to do processor class is also a tthing the library guarantees that it will only pass tthings to the corresponding tthingprocessor that created so it but while the code above is a bit stupid in that it really do it shows why processthing simply be shifted to tthing and be polymorphic the xsum variable needs to be can i restructure the code so the cast is i need to keep the library code separate but be able to accept any the to an due to suggestion so it will at least throw exception instead of crash in the case of mismatched casting when passing objects through library code

difference is that the value of a static readonly field is set at run and can thus be modified by the containing whereas the value of a const field is set to a compile time the static readonly the containing class is allowed to modify it the variable declaration a variable the static constructor if not readonly is typically used if the type of the field is not allowed in a const or when the value is not known at compile readonly fields are also that for reference in both cases and the readonly modifier only prevents you from assigning a new reference to the it specifically does not make immutable the object pointed to by the public static readonly test test new static void test new a static readonly field cannot be assigned to in a static constructor or a variable public string difference is that static can be modified by the containing but const can never be modified and must be initialized to a compile time to expand on the static case a the containing class can only modify in the variable declaration a variable in the static constructor constructors if not keyword in const string abc only at is evaluated at compile time and can not be changed at run attempt to change it will cause a compilation is already kind of classes and structs are initialized at run time with new you set a constant to a class or it has to be one of the integral keyword in readonly string be initialized in declaration code or consturctor is evaluated at run be declared as static or instance level read only field can hold a complex object by using the new keyword at run kumar

even simpler than hashtable is nothing more than an array of vectors which contain the maximum size of this array is typically smaller than the number of items in the set of possible values for the type of data being stored in the hash algorithm is used to generate an index into that array based on the values of the item that will be stored in the is where storing vectors of pairs in the array come because the set of values that can be indexes in the array is typically smaller than the number of all possible values that the type can it is possible that your hash algorithm is going to generate the same value for two separate a hash algorithm will prevent this as much as possible is why it is relegated to the type usually because it has specific information which a general hash algorithm possibly but impossible to of you can have multiple keys that will generate the same hash when that the items in the vector are iterated and a direct comparison is done between the key in the vector and the key that is being looked if it is great and the value associated with the key is nothing is

find that junior programmers use way too the decision to use should boil down to these simple you handle the this means to try or use different return substitute you provide a better error message you need to log this specific in mind that all errors be logged at the highest level for example in the file in you need to clean resource used within an such as a database connection or you answered yes to any of then use if you said then you can safely just allow an error page to be displayed and have the global error handler log you do intend to log or clean up but still let the exception pass you use and not create a brand new doing so will eliminate your stack trace and basically give the error no found excellent from that seems to put it very handling should appear exactly two an error is expected a web request for there is some meaningful behavior be done in the case of a failure as retrying after some a system in which case you need to make a decision about you are going to expose the error the outside

has to have separate clauses for each template that is two templates are that all deserve their template class template constructor this case which fails because of the ambiguity as to where the parameter belongs a void typename what is up with the parameter sure the compiler could guess it could belong to but guesswork is not what the compiler likes the existing rule says that depending on the nesting of template clauses appear in the right everything is clear if one comes up with a rule how to match the parameters to arguments of the templates involved far i see a real difficulty in doing it would be because as of one template clause lists all parameters that the corresponding template much like a function parameter if we would put everything into one that clear semantic could be broken not to mention that when we put the definition into the class all of a sudden the template would get its own provides arguments for then for f ones when much more natural when we have separate template clauses that catch each their own the syntax for the above wrong definition also the reader of the code immediately sees that this is a definition of a member and not a accidentally declared but second parameter for

i think found what you take a look you must define a webmethod on your server and then you can easily access it using an exellent working example is under the link and here modify it to show how you can pass your page use this class to class public string name public string color this is your in my case partial class public static string return name is on your this is what we want to send to the var dogitem and this is how it should be sent in serialized var dogitemserialized dogitemserialized here you fill textboxes and then your data is sent to the server which understands it as a dog pay attention to arguments because this is the most confusing you should pass them in json which is a little bit so i use here script which helps to convert usual javascript object into string it is available but it is still rather ugly it is important that i pass argument called which value is the serialized because this is exactly what the server expects to get for i change the argument this dogitemserialized the last pay attention to the following you are working with prior to then need to write just instead of only encapsulates all the data under member for some in the above article you can find useful links inside the article and in so you can read more about and so hope this

i understand i think you perhaps are misunderstanding how the module you are already specifying an address of for the server to bind you start the server via your call to this is going to cause the server to start listening to a socket on to the that socket is passed to your requesthandler as the when data is received on the your method should be able to that object using the documented socket you want a further it looks like your requesthandler can extend from streamrequesthandler and to the socket using objects point there is no need for you to create an additional socket and then try to force your server to use the new one part of the value of the socketserver module is that it manages the lifecycle of the socket for the flip if you want to test your server from a then you would want to create a socket that you can your client requests but you would never pass this socket to your per you would probably do this in a completely separate process and test your server via ipc over the based on new get server a to open a socket to server b when server a receives data one solution is to simply open a socket from inside your that there are likely some other design concerns that you will need to address based on the requirements of your you may want to use a simple connection pool that say opens a few sockets to server b that server a can use like a there may already be some libraries in python that help with your current your requesthandler has access to the server as a member variable so you could do something like def point socketb hold serverb def data if print do whatever with the like i it may be better for you to have some sort of connection pool or other object that manages your server b socket such that your server a handler can just the socket as incoming requests are way you can better deal with conditions where server b breaks the your current design be able to handle broken sockets very just some

ia a very broad are you looking to write your own or just a simple application can do that with erb quite biggest pitfall i can see to not using a framework one that is that it will be much harder for other people to figure out what your code is and you lose all the automated data document and other goodies that frameworks tie if you do all the just written a written a horrible mess of spaghetti since a beginning is read the rails and try and figure out what it not because necessarily a great but because your understanding of web frameworks will be a lot more complete by diving into a and this is very looked at a few of your other and it looks like a so going to caution you against writing your own not because a bad idea per but because of what a software framework represents the sum total of years of experience in working with language are like beavers we want to we want to to build always with the idea of fixing the shortcomings of the existing while this is a very noble it tends to lead people down the path of getting very little because they willing to use tools that other people have often for what boil down to cosmetic younger coders are especially guilty of and i was no different i wasted literally years screwing around with writing webservers and database abstraction instead of writing software that i could have made money i could go back and do things i would have started contributing to the frameworks that already rather than just trying to it from there is an exception to that rule of other work and that is when got the experience with the tools to know when time to build something dhh guy who started was a very ruby coder before he decided to write a ruby probably at reading what other people have cooked and rather than just starting on your learn more about the make a valuable contribution to the and give yourself some good resume

in there is a need for some code to be run before is if only to transform the command line into the c calling in the standard library needs some and the exact needs can vary from compile to true program entry point is set at link and is usually in a module named something like for historical as the source to that module is available in the crt support initializations that are discovered at link a special segment is its structure is a list of function pointers of fixed which will be iterated early in and each function this same array one very much like of function pointers is used in a link to hold pointers to constructors of global array is filled in by the linker by allowing every module linked to include data in which are all concatenated together to form the segment in the finished only significance to the variable is that it is declared the to be located in that and is initialized to the address of a function to be called during the c the details of this are extremely for general you are probably better served by wrapping your initialization and your current main inside a new char other return special modifying the module itself or doing tricks to get additional early initialization functions called can be the best for when building embedded systems that run from rom without an operating system it is common to need to customize the behavior of the module in order to have a stack at all on which to push the parameters to in that there may be no better solution than to modify to initialize the memory hardware to suit your

is a lot of talk about monads these i have read a few articles blog but i go far enough with their examples to fully grasp the the reason is that monads are a functional language and thus the examples are in languages i worked with i used a functional language in i grasp the syntax deeply enough to follow the articles fully but i can tell something worth understanding i know pretty including lambda expressions and other functional i know only has a subset of functional and so maybe monads be expressed in surely it is possible to convey the at least i hope maybe you can present a example as a and then describe what a developer would he could do from there but because the language lacks functional programming this would be because it would convey the intent and benefits of so my is the best explanation you can give of monads to a 3 by the i know there are at least 3 is a questions already on i face the same problem with them so this question is needed because of the a developer what is a

is a very good and one not limited to orm always feel important to remember some of the problems that an mapping framework if the rest of the application is based on strong accessing data persistence using objects makes the code just that much more internally and sometimes layer an orm provides a clear layer in your application for db it encapsulates all the functions needed to data in one the epitome of the dry not repeat this makes a few things much because all the select and code is in one spot rather than throughout the because all db access goes through one and because easy to mock out your data models and access if they are clearly while easy to secure raw sql use against injection attacks and even easier if you have an orm framework as a single point of that does it for you so you never have to think about that speed is not on the an orm is a level of indirection between your code and the we certainly hold orm designers responsible for writing a framework that produces good sql but an orm is meant to provide and not executional a developer who has read a basic book on sql will always be able to get better performance talking directly to the are certainly strategies to counter and in django those are as ozan has and but they give you the same performance as a direct sql because of i would never use an orm framework that does not provide some mechanism for issuing a raw sql statement on those occasions when i need for i often resort to raw sql when generating a large report out of the database that joins many the orm way can take the sql way can take said i never start by worrying about each individual my advice for anyone coming to an orm layer nanny the database write your application or and then profile tweaking those areas that truly need the performance or using to reduce the overall of your

is how i resolved about everything in my runs from the click method of a button in the i have changed all those click methods to consist only of a parameterless then created a new file called entrypoint that had lots of very short friend each of which was usually one or two calls to parameterised worker so that all the click methods just called into this for a function that opens a standard document and calls a into our the function takes a parameter of which document to and there are a couple of dozen standard documents that we i have sub ctrl as byref canceldefault as handles the thisaddin and sub my new entrypoints add a new addinutilities file which interface debug class implements private addin as debug sub implements friend sub theaddin as end end go to the thisaddin file and add utilities as overrides function as if utilities is nothing utilities new end return now possible to test the function in entrypoints using something like public class appword as objmacros as public sub appword new dim addin as comaddin dim addinutilities as for each tempaddin as comaddin in if addin end addinutilities objmacros public sub public sub only thing you then unit test are the actual click because calling into entrypoints in a different ie through the requestcomaddinautomationservice interface rather than through the event it

is no event that is raised when a page is also the event in other is not called when a page is since the user might navigate to other pages of the same web application therefore the session will continue to can think of 3 possible ways to solve work this use to store data with this is what viewstate is made and unless you have a lot of it should not be a if you have a lot of that it will be and sent to the to the server for every request may result in large requests and therefore bad instead of putting the data into the put it into the a low sliding expiration on your you can access your data in the same way as from the data but you have to be prepared that the data was removed from the cache have to it again from db for if the time between two requests was bigger than the expiration use the and trigger some action a ajax to remove the data from the but i think the onunload event is not reliable will not be fired in any when the browser is terminated by a crash or with the task or if javascript is	
is no option to specify the order of operations in a transaction as it is as follows the sql statements are issued in the following entity in the same order the corresponding objects were saved using entity collection collection element updates and collection entity in the same order the corresponding objects were deleted using exception is that objects using native id generation are inserted when they are can i challenge you to answer you are adding a new entity with an existing an identifier is supposed to be unique to a specific if that entity is so should be its option would be to do an update on that record instead of a this keeps the id the same so there is no unique constraint violation the key at and you can change all the other data so that a apparently i entirely paying attention to the question when i responded since this is a problem with a unique constraint on a think you have two solutions to choose after your delete which will execute all the changes to the session up to that after which you can continue with the rest your new this works inside of a transaction as well so you need to worry about a function which updates the existing entity with new data but keeps the and the unique column the	
is no programmatic way in vba to view the call stack that i know the usual solution to this problem is to use some structure to track calling of but it always seems like a kludge to and really of use only when programming at in which case it seems to me that the capability for seeing the call stack is i always put the call stack button on my vbe since one of the most frequently used functions for i also add the compile button i think crazy that not on the toolbar by default because it encourages people to code without ever forcing a then access 2000 even use option explicit by default for consistency with the other apps using the vbe in other dumb down access in order to make it consistent with apps that nearly as i	
is no support for rtl languages in yui i filed a bug about it over a year ago and got a response saying they might add it in a later can no longer find the bug since they switched to their new hopefully adding rtl support for yui but i checked out the preview releases can i find them mentioning adding rtl not to say yui menus cannot do though it takes a bit of work as no i make no claims that this works in all especially not you need the menu items to flow the opposite and start on the opposite side of the i believe this works in most browsers of argh for that you need to do some extra work which i remember the answer you need the submenus of the menubar to flow the opposite you can do this by changing the attribute of your for the main you have to manually add all the so that you can set the submenualignment on worst part is trying to get the keyboard events to work as at this point pressing right makes the cursor go left and to do have to hijack and change it so if the menubar is set rtl this info in a var it processes a bit have to figure this one out on your but it should be a simple matter of switching cases on key

it is possible to implement more than one service contract on a wcf service type class that is attributed with the servicebehavior since it is just a matter of having the class implement multiple if you are using any of the visual studio templates or other kinds of code this may not be immediately although you can implement more than one service contract interface on a service it does not do you much good if you need the presumably a singleton in this to behave as one ibusinessservice implies that you need all of the functionality to be callable from one client so that all operations may operate in the same logical session to aspx web if that is not the then you are free to define individual proxies for each contract but that will also require that you support one endpoint for each it an absolute requirement that you can only have on wcf servicehost instance for your what factors are influencing your the partial classes do not trouble me the idea of splitting out code into multiple files now seems rather for storing partial classes in files like and seems natural in addition to storing the core logic in the following question might be of

key to this is examining any information you recieve and then display use in code on the form variables if they contain javascript that you store and later redisplay is a security as are any thing that gets concatenated unexamined into a sql statement you potential gotcha to watch for are attacks that mess with the character for instance if i submit a form with character set but you store and later display in latin with no translation then i might be able to sneak something past your the easiest way to handle this is to always display and store in the same character is usually a good never depend on the browser to do the right thing for you in this set explicit character sets and examine the character sets you recieve and do a translation to the expected storage set before you validate	
keys are meant to mean is the unique identifier of this inserting many rows with the same then not your primary you plan to insert exact duplicates for then you have a primary key at all and you should drop it for you plan to insert different roles to each then you could just add the role to the primary key and good to

law of demeter should be the suggestion of says that you an object to get at their child if as a need to perform some most of the time the domain model working with should support that is in principle a dumb hierarchy of it is like a filesystem of where each object could have child you almost always reach through with you can optionally build up composite object types using rest and as long as the provider and the client agree on you can avoid the how do you balance rest and it seems to me that they are not in because rest is all about coupling to the point where it is pointless for the provider to try to anticipate all the needs of the whereas demeter assumes that logic can migrate to its most natural place through you could argue that rest is just a until you understand your clients is rest just a is demeter unrealistic in any of demeter

let you parameterize code over types in the same way that arguments let you parameterize it over that probably explain a whole so lets go through it a step at a you want a program to print like you write void like well and but you also like so now you void like like notice that your two functions are almost you want to reuse the but provide different for what you void like is what function arguments are they let you reuse the same code with different are like but instead of passing in different you pass in lets say got code that needs to bundle two strings into an void s string return new b and later you realize you also need to bundle ints into an void s i string return new b int return new b like we can see a bunch of redundancy what we need is a function that returns a pair of and a way to the type of what we want a pair this is what generics are void s i t return new b angle brackets let you pass in a type to a function in the same way parentheses let you pass in here is the name of a type argument just like was the value argument any place t appears in the function will be replaced with the actual type you pass in and int in the a bunch of stuff you can do with generics beyond but the basic generics let you pass types into functions in the same way arguments let you pass in

like anonymous are actually very complex even if we rule out that still leaves a of not least being captured which fundamentally the code that uses them you think of as variables become fields on with a bit of smoke and not in the least surprised that you use them idly there is a of compiler work type generation behind the that supports this

like to combine a few metrics of nodes in a social network graph into a single value for rank ordering the problem is that and are measured on different say vs and follow a power law distribution least definitely not the normal there a good way to rescale the variables so that one dominate the other in determining the obvious approaches the variables and divide by this seems it would squash the distribution too hiding the massive difference between a value in the long tail and one near the variables to the range by subtracting and dividing by this seems closer to fixing the problem since it change the shape of the but maybe it really address the in particular the means will be the means by dividing each value by this address the difference in but perhaps the mean values are more important for the other way to multiple variables following power law distribution for use in linear

much simpler is to just pad the estimate and the user progression bars are there more for ui responsiveness than duration the user needs to have feedback confirming that the program stalled but care that much about completion waiting for a and it goes to completion in 10 seconds getting frustrated when it takes another 20 seconds to complete the last the same if it goes to in 30 keeps going until and then magically jumps to but not the task is really short or completely some animated loop works as well loading iphone wait you are in the couple cases where you really need accuracy then probably worth spending some time in the code for better reliability of the

my application uses log4j for logging and usually i do logging by checking whether a particular level is enabled and then log like the this if check reduces our branch coverage during junit in order to overcome my friend suggested getting rid of checks for one of my friends suggested removing the if check and log the problem with this approach is that it might slow down the application due to formation of strings which would not end up in log files second approach i thought of was very similar to with date new felt very attractive and solution internally uses but i am concerned about the performance this might also note that is my internal utility class and in each of its log there is a check of log do you guys i went through velocity templates but it requires map of is there any lightweight solution which just substitutes values based on param index location or is this solution complexity and concern about messageformat

of it depends a lot on how your services are implemented you can do a lot to reduce the payload by just being careful of how your method signatures are not only the soap envelope but the message itself can be a lot more bulky in xml rather than a streamlined binary just choosing the right class and member names can reduce it a the following examples of serialized method returns from methods returning a collection of a just choosing the right name for and members can make a big difference in the verbosity of the serialized soap if returning repeated data short

of projects do just use arraylist or hashmap or whatever to handle all their collection let me put one caveat on whenever you are creating classes and using them throughout your if possible refer to the interfaces they implement rather than the concrete classes you are using to implement rather than insuranceclaims new insuranceclaims new insuranceclaims new the rest of your code only knows it by the interface it implements or then swapping it out for another implementation becomes much easier down the road if you find you need a different i saw this happen just a month ago when i needed to swap out a regular hashmap for an implementation that would return the items to me in the same order i put them in when it came time to iterate over all of fortunately just such a thing was available in the jakarta commons collections and i just swapped out a for b with only a one line code change because both implemented

order to run a program a bash or binary you need to have execute when you enter a the first word as in the specifies the command to and that is started up as a separate in the case of a shell it executes a new copy of the shell interpreter listed on the and runs the program using that ls 1 lambda lambda 23 mar 25 chmod 744 foo or chmod ls 1 lambda lambda 23 mar 25 you use the that is a shell builtin command that says to source the file into the current that means that it executes the commands in the file as if you had run them from the command right in the current you need only read permission to source a for if you set a variable in a it change the value in the current but if you source a bash script into the current then it does change the cat setvariables echo echo shell function in your is a lot like a but it acts like a command in the current when you source your using that defines that function in the current and it can execute like any other shell function you have far as the permissions are i would bet that before changing the permissions to 100 means only not which is fairly useless for a file since you need to be able to read it and execute it to do you had already sourced the file into your current that would mean that the function was already and it matter the permissions of the file after once the function is defined in the current you can even delete the and as long as that shell is still the function will still be as i see from your edited once you unset the you get an that indicates strongly to me that my hypothesis was and that you had already sourced the file before you changed as i sourcing and executing the file are entirely different and once you source a its permissions matter at the function has already been loaded into the currently running you can tell by running your original experiment after doing the if you you have read and then the function be

problem i was working on recently got me to wishing that i could lop off the front of a kind of like a at if you truncating a file at the back end is a common we do without even thinking much about but lopping off the front of a sounds ridiculous at but only because been trained to think that but a lop operation could be useful in some simple example not the only or necessarily the best is a fifo adding new items to the end of the file and pulling items out of the file from the the file grows over time and a huge empty space at the with current file there are several ways around this each item is copy items up to replace the although it solution is very the size of the empty space and when it reaches size or percentage of file move everything truncate the this is efficient than the but still costs time are moved in the a circular queue in adding new items to the hole front of the file as items this can be quite if you mind of things getting out in the if you do the potential to move items but a circular queue is to implement and manages if there was a lop removing an item from the queue would be as easy as updating the as in as truncating a is there no such understand a bit about file systems and see any particular reason this would be it looks to me like all it would require is another word per allocation entry to say where the file starts within the with 1 terabyte drives under it seems like a pretty small price to pay for such other tasks would be made easier if you could lop off the front of a file as efficiently as you can truncate at the you think of any technical reason this function be added to a modern file file at

problem is worse than the previous two answers you know what to sound so but where did you ever see something like and what did it mean or what do you even want that to figure out what you want to create a class that can represent add a property of that class to the server you may have to add a typeconverter or other designer support in order for to convert your preferred textual representation into an instance of the be able to get something like the properties of a going to make a guess about what some of these values and try to show you how to deal with them in a my guess could be far work with assume this applies to the domain of automobile and that the color property is meant to represent the finish given to the car as a in that would probably be an referring to the type of finish i know what other sorts of finish apply to a i know from building model cars when i was a kid that paints may be or or so those three would be enum values of one would be one of many this would give something like enum notpaint enum enum class public finishtype finishtype public paintfinish paintfinish public carcolor carcolor class car public carfinish color would allow for something like	
problem seems to be that the system recover sufficient memory even after a full garbage this also has the negative effect of promoting objects to tenured and survivor spaces that really belong size of the old generation should settle down over most objects are at least should very short if you find that the old generation keeps growing then there may be a resource leak from your graph it seems like some allocation is tipping the system over the edge and into a gc death to get the an idea of what objects are being more how long they are hanging this will give you the best idea of where you should be

realize there have already been a number of posts on design and this could possibly be me over thinking things and going round in but i have myself all confused now and would like to get some clarity from the community am trying to separate a project i design architecturally very well to start out into different layers in their own should only call the logic layer to get its should not call or have references to anything just be a way of storing the layer should hold all of the methods to delete objects in the system and would have references to both the bo and the it would apply the business logic to the operations then delegate the actual crud to the would just do the crud operations on the it would have a reference to the as it would return them for the gets question is should the logic classes only call their equivalent dal class and just call logic classes in other class should only call so if it wanted to get a client object by id it would call rather than the reason i thought it maybe should stay on the its own layer was would seem to loosen the coupling between about the if getting a client object had some logic validation in it not the best but hope it gets the point am not sure if it is bad design by me but at the moment the business layer has a number of classes including clientbull and both classes have a call to one i use an interface for each class and have a factory to build the objects to try and reduce any coupling but they can not exist without each other now due to calling methods in both is this a bad architecture design seperation of

reason you are warned away from static methods is that using them forfeits one of the advantages of objects are intended for data this prevents unexpected side effects from happening which avoids static methods have no encapsulated and so garner this if you have no use of internal they are fine to use and slightly faster to make sure you touching global data in them languages also have variables which would allow for encapsulation of data and static

see you have several options and a couple of decisions to could think about driven you could use trac to support communication rather that tickets and early a list of the features to be developed and state that the version happens when all the features are developed and make umbrella tickets for all there are and will define development define a couple of milestones based on the amount of features planned and the first milestone should contain at least one since the goal of a milestone is get the project built for testing and define one or more milestones to mark when all features are call them or during development there is a need to be shy in making and make the umbrella tasks dependent on these newer bug report need to be under any of and can have as much detail as these are these will define development one exception is a bug squashing sprint to eliminate publish the names of the developers with more assigned and not solved bugs to compel them to solve the of the process of making a a beta or a release candidate is tag the source to make the process and be able to spot bugs even when the trunk source has already on the usual way to tag consists of copying the trunk source to a directory on and make sure nobody commits into that believe a two number version number is enough for most the first number denote compatibility and the the but there are several variables that can be inside a version source binary bugfix companion product version protocol

seen compilers that emit any if no function at all exists defined in one implementation file instead of a header they would throw errors like or something and you would be confused as as i not conformant with the but it happens so consider putting at least one virtual function not in the header only the virtual so that the compiler could emit a vtable for the class at that i know it happens with some versions of someone inline virtual functions can be a benefit but of course most often you will use it when you do know the dynamic type of the because that was the whole reason for in the first compiler however completely ignore it has other semantics apart from speeding up a the for definitions is the mechanism which allows you to put the definition into the only functions can be defined multiple times throughout the whole program without a violation any in the it behaves as you would have defined it only once in the whole even though you included the header multiple times into different files linked

solving the wrong the problem is that you have data which you want your users to and that stored in a location to which the users have start by attempting to fix the problem of users with more access than they you protect the whole you may want to look into just protecting the move it to a separate location and encrypt encrypt the data with a key only accessible by a specific id not and write a small suid program to access the in your setuid do your validation of who should be running the and compare the name checksum of the calling program can inspect the command line for the process in combination with the calling cwd to find the use lsof or the with the expected value before it takes more than you really need to reevaluate the state of users on the system they either have too much access or you have too little

stumbled across something explaining how to use flex profiler in flex builder and it was a huge help to me in debugging memory i would definitely suggest trying it very easy to some things i found when profiling my using collections least large as properties of value i had several types of value object classes in my cairngorm and each had a property which was an and was used for when i found that these were one of my biggest memory so i changed my application to instead store the as an and use this for the memory used was cut something like class public var public var public var stores any number of owner2 class public var public var public var stores any number of owner3 class public var public var class public var public var class public var public var public var refers to id of owner1 class public var public var public var refers to id of owner2 would also suggest removing event listeners when they are no longer

synthesis is a particularly tricky problem because of the almost infinite number of ways of fingering the and exciting the the string will oscillate at its base frequency plus a number of harmonic with much much less recommend looking at the fourier plot of a single string can get the steady state sound of the string pretty close by adding in the correct but you also need to remember to simulate the sustain and decay periods the amplitude will rise sharply probably when the string is it will drop off a little and sustain mostly for a short period and finally decay over a longer you need to get this right for it to sound like a guitar and not something

the best approach for injecting dependencies if spring or guice are not your library was written in a it should be fairly easy to use as a straitforward java think of your past experience with there are several libraries out there that fit perfectly with the spring model but were written before spring i see nothing bad with a followed by a couple of followed by a call to the just be extra among other your client can forget to call thouse methods that spring reliably i consider something like a factory method to instantiate and wire the the dependencies are all inside the so it seem appropriate to have the application instantiate each dependency to create the main the client application decide you are providing a let the api client wire its own provide an that same example can be used to make the factory method on the maybe the client application has own way to configure and it would be desirable if the api your library provides to be flexible enough to take advantage of maybe you can include the licence is just like a whole piece of java

the rigidity of clear interfaces mean that flexible code must be use java and perl as respective not that code being messy makes it but that code being flexible makes it almost has a different meaning in exploratory code vs older perhaps talking about thanks to mario pays much attention to the content of the language and standard libraries are steeped in oo and it even has the extensively used keyword the jvm and language themselves have specifications of external has a history of clear and open specifications a clear interface that works well is very difficult to do but when done the result can be very a specification an oo is by its nature rigid any flexibility it has is rigidly circumscribed by the result is that if you correctly predicted the the degrees of freedom the design has great clarity and precision it will actually act as a towards the right questions to and give you useful terms with which to think about the spirit of perl is more than one way to do and the language syntax itself has evolved considerably over the years incompatible like this attitude carries on into programs written in the one can write perl to clear it and often this can result is code but if you understand you can change it in arbitrary that it is ugly but flexible perhaps my definition of ugly needs to mjd said of order that he have written it with because it would lack the flexibility he i hope not putting words in his mouth but i think the same would apply to interfaces and specifications that is something that tdd seems to me that java code tends be neat but and perl code to be messy but java upfront and perl favors my code i keep facing a choice between neat for i compared a visitor pattern against one big function of cascading latter is but it is many times easier to add parameters to the recursive method calls is only a problem if you need that degree of flexibility i find i do in exploratory the visitor pattern refactors the as method at the cost of defining and calling those one class per so that an added argument must be added to all those methods and all the calls of in all those i coded these designs and counted how many places needed arguments 9 places for visitor different 3 places for in one the solution is much easier to even though question about java and perl just using them as illustrative examples to make the question more concrete and and hopefully easier to arbitrarily flexible code necessarily being arbitrarily flexible make code

the thing you are having trouble with is defining the proper the interface defines the interaction between the subscriber and the make a winforms like static class the main entry point for the static void interface void class observerlist public void foreach titem in are making two things the first the interface which the subscribers will then a list for the publisher to hold all the make form one with two one labeled form 2 and the other labeled form then add a then another button labeled public partial class form1 private new private observerlist myobservers new public private void eventargs form2 frmnewform new private void eventargs form3 frmnewform new private void eventargs private void eventargs deliberately set up the form2 button and the form3 button to make multiple copies of each type of for you can have twelve up at will notice that after creating each form i put it into the observers i am able to do this because both form2 and form3 implement after i show the form i call refresh on the observer list so the new form is updated with the latest note i could have cast it to a variable of iobserver and updated just that i am trying to be as brief as for the add button i pull the text from the textbox store it in my datalist and then refresh all the make add a list box and the following public partial class form2 public private void eventargs void foreach s in add a combobox and add the following public partial class form3 public private void eventargs void foreach s in will notice that each form implements the refresh method of the iobserver interface slightly one is for a listbox the other for a combo the use of interfaces is the key element a real world application this example would be more for example instead of passing the string list in the refresh it would not have any instead the publisher in this would implement a publisher interface and register itself with the observers as they are being each observer would be able to accept a publisher in initialization then when it is refreshed it would pull the string list out of the publisher via a method exposed through the more complex applications with multiple types of data this allows you customize what data the form implementing iobserver is pulling out of the course if you only want the observer to be able to display a string list or specific then pass it as part of the the interface makes explicit what want each layer to this way 5 years from now you can look at the code and code that what it is

there are architectural strengths and there was a while in there when powerpc chips consistently beat their intel counterparts in a range of floating point intensive and that difference was reflected in how fast they ran some of the nuclear physics codes i was working on at the they ran word and excel like and then their clock speeds really started to and it was all over for powerpc chips on the i image apple only stuck with them for as long as they did so that they could get the execution layer working note that many architectures have simd instruction multiple floating point and integer arithmetic units these days those these are only mildly vectorized in the general purpose chips when compared to special purpose processors like

thilo but explain a little further webserver is this is really the problem of the you just log and then say now this user is logged you need some way to identify which user it is requesting a new site this common way of doing this is by implementing if you your network traffic while logging and then browsing a site commonly notice something like you will transmit your username and password to the completely https will encrypt this request for you to avoid you will receive a randomly generated string of a lot of weird these will typically be stored in a of some site only you should have access you will transmit the randomly generated string to the the server will look this string and see that associated with your this allows the server to identify and grant you access to your http in itself is not this means that your password and your randomly generated will be transmitted completely if someone has access to your traffic router he will be able to see your username password when you log if not using this will grant him access to your site untill you change your password he changes it first in the rest of the requests he will be able to get your session which means he could steal your identity for the rest of that cookie lifecycle you log or the session expires on the you want to feel use realistically a lot easier to social engineer a keylogger into your computer than it is to read all your traffic as others have pointed use to read your session	
thing i noticed is your script not valid should be hide the	
thing that can be done is to use javascript to grab the current time when a event occurs that triggers a to your passing this value back to your server side will allow you to render it back to the client as your initial time that you can compare of using i believe you can put script inline at the end of the document so that it runs as soon as the browser renders that portion of the this will allow you to compare the current time when the inline script runs against the trigger time that was captured when the user initiated the as mentioned by since you can only reliably control the of the it would be best to include in your metrics the server page generation if you have both you can at least see how much of the total time is taken by page and how much is dependent on the various delays that could occur on the	
thing that often helps is to use a lightweight memory if you combine this with allocation methods any until all done with the you can get something ridiculously did this for an embedded system mostly for performance but it saved a lot of memory as trick was basically to allocate a big block slightly bigger than need could allocate a chain of blocks if you and just keep returning a pointer it up by rounded up to maximum align requirement of 4 in our each this cut our overhead per alloc from on the order of bytes down to 3 we also ignored calls until we were all done parsing and then freed the whole clever enough with your frame allocation you can save a lot of space and it might not get you all the way to your but it would be worth looking at how much space overhead you really my experience with systems is that they use tons of small each with a relatively high you have virtual a large might not even hurt that if your access at any given time is local to a page or three you have to keep the memory you actually need in the long but the becomes a lot more efficient this

think it would be more correct to say that the question of whether the strategies must be deterministically identical is outside the scope of the definition of the strategy a function always returns the same result for given it is if two functions are deterministic and they always return the same value for the same inputs then they are deterministically they may or may not have the same side if they do then they are just plain this is not the let us consider an example that appears to require deterministic you might think that if two comparer implementations fail to return the same result for the same inputs then at least one of them must be but this is not necessarily the orders vary between some places sort some put mcduck with and so these are this is a perfect application of strategy and the strategies are most certainly deterministically

think your approach sounds if your wcf services will only be used by your front end i would probably think about hosting the service layer in a windows service and use tcp you have to deal with iis and possibly no but that could require you to change your infrastructure requirements could still use port but you will be faced with other annoying issues related to using ports that iis normally you can start with binding and switch later anyway with minimal impact to the overall is the beauty of the services i would also consider publishing 1 simple facade on top of your two that way your client couple itself to the concepts of your oracle db and unix this debatable you only mentioned the technologies if the two systems represent distinct business domains then keeping them separate makes if you are only splitting them because they are two different systems then i would try to abstract those systems from the passing credentials i would recommend using an authorization policy in combination with for more help on this topic check out if you found it here is an to get you

throw any exception that is automatically thrown by the clr due to user for instance reason being is to do so creates confusion for people calling your users should be able to distinguish between actively thrown exceptions by an api and exceptions that are not actively thrown by reason is that at actively thrown exception generally represents a known state in an if i call an api and it throwns an i have a reasonable expectation that the given object is in a good it recognized a potentially bad situation and actively accounted for on the other hand if it throwns a that is an indication that the api encountered an unknown error and is now in an unreliable lesser reason is that these exceptions behave differently when thrown by user code as opposed to the for instance possible to catch a stackoverflowexception if thrown by user but not if thrown by the responding to also should not throw applicationexception or systemexception these exceptions types are too general to provide meaningful information to the code which calls your true you can put a very descriptive message into the message but not straight forward or maintainable to catch an exception based on a much better to catch it based on the rule on this

times you are reporting are measured using the clock function returns an approximation of processor time used by the time real time will be less for multiprocessor but the processor time will typically be you use multiple the work may be done by more than one but the amount of work is the and in addition there may be some overhead such as contention for limited measures the total processor which will be the work any contention so it should never be less than the processor time for doing the work in a single a little hard to tell from the question whether you knew and were surprised that the value returned by was twice that for a single thread rather than being only a little or you were expecting it to be instead need the realtime library time still is less of a than one might hope but at least the numbers make some the bus frequency is 1600 so i suspect with a read and a write for each iteration some memory bandwidth limited as tstenner and the value shows that most of the time some of your processors are waiting for anyone know whether time includes such	
tip you are mvc tip create cascading dropdown lists with ajax from stephen walther was not done with mvc realease it works fine with the downloaded project fixing some small but when the you try to incorporate into mvc release things in the downloaded the scripts are in the content in release the scripts are in the scripts some not of the files in the release changed from the bets and this may be a problem downloaded his project a couple of minor and it worked fine within that project i fixed the car as you there are some type problems with tutorials and blogs are everyone wants to be considered an on new technology being released so they write tutorials on betas and the result is that the will have stuff that work with the final you need to find is a professional that has posted a professional will ensure that their tutorials what i mean by a professional is a professional trainer in that area of walther has one of the better blogs and a lot of good but remember that he is a microsoift he authors books on ms technology so he needs to be active in the blog world so he puts some good stuff out on leading edge this keeps him deemed as an expert so his books can regardless of the there will be inaccuracies in on betas and when you try to use the information in a final

to read the lisp are vectors of this means that most of those functions are look at clhs gives this item sequence test start end count are sequences of so a call to remove would is a is no a string is item to remove from a string has to be a nothing because the test is by default eql and eql compares the character in the string with your item also key is by default identity and does not change the if your argument is a then you have to do looks at each character of the sequence and makes it into a the string then will be compared with your item using the function this works the cost is that it needs to generate a string from each character of each string is a new way to do it a retrieves the first character of in every test and compares it with the character from the string again the cost is that it needs to get the character five times this the best way to write it if your original object comes as a we get the character from the string once and then remove compares this character with the default eql test with each character in the string it returns a new string of those characters that are not eql to do you expect to in common lisp this is the symbol does not work since a string is not an element of a characters are elements of remember also that strings with one item like are still strings and not a thus and are of different the first is a string and the second is a extracts a sequence from a that means it also extracts a string from another 1 where 1 is the start and 5 is the end appends this means that it also appends returns a new string with the strings and remove parts of a string see also the functions and as in one other answer to remove substrings from a string you need to write some code to extract some strings and then concatenate searches for strings in

to the assertion that this cannot be done using pure here is a counter example showing how it can be that i say it was easy it assume the name is with columns and as shown in the edits does everyone forget to include the table name in the from 1 as from where not exists from where as 1 as from where not exists from where as where and not exists from where and two parallel queries in the from clause generate values that are respectively at the top and bottom of a gap in the range of values in the the of these two lists is then restricted so that the bottom is not greater than the and such that there is no value in the original list in between the bottom and the sample this produces the range when i added an extra row it also generated the range you also have two other possible ranges for a suitable definition of you are using this there will generally not be many gaps in your can only appear when you delete rows from the table you ignore the ranges returned by this query or its relatives when inserting is usually a bad idea to reuse so in fact this effort is probably if you want to do here is one way to do

two terms differentiate between two different ways of walking a is probably easiest just to exhibit the consider the b e first traversal would visit the nodes in this that you go all the way one leg before moving first traversal would visit the node in this we work all the way each level before going that there is some ambiguity in the traversal and cheated to maintain the order at each level of the in either case i could get to b before or after and likewise i could get to e before or after this may or may not depends on you kinds of traversal can be achieved with the the root node in are nodes in n get the node from store all the children of n in do some work on difference between the two traversal orders lies in the choice of use a recursive implementation uses the use a recursive implementation looks work on the payload foreach child of alternate time to work on the payload node recursion ends when you reach a node that has no so it is guaranteed to end acyclic this still cheated a with a little cleverness you can also the nodes in this is a variation of where i do the work at each node until walking back up the i have however the higher nodes on the way down to find their traversal is fairly natural in the recursive implementation the line above instead of the first and not hard if you use a explicit but leave it as an

understand that this is a very broad but a short kind of answer will not be strategies are born to deal with broad issues should an application designer take into consideration when devising the error and exception handling the strategy will differ depending on the software type business hosted web embedded is the software type political and legal perspectives on error handling business ideas that i would have error reporting routes automatic admin in and robustness contingency and recovery against problems that are not yet users and customers fairly minimising the impact on software users and other people serviced by looking for a similar list of ideas and do use comments to point me out if i need to clarify the question further and thanks to everyone platform will definitely have some affect on the resulting implementation detail of the strategy from a developer perspective but less so from point of it is certainly most legacy systems i was asked to work on did not have a clear error handling this be made a community it seems as a good question and good questions are hard to come up do you mean by the a long term plan that gives brings consistency and coordination to error and exception in case of a larger team working on software the strategy can be formilised and distributed in a written seems to be duplicate question practices for exception management in java or and and why do you prefer exceptions or return these questions deal with a certain perspective on error handling like to learn more about other perspectives and how they contribute to the overall should be included in the error and exception handling

want to learn how others cope with the following is not homework or an assignment of any the example classes have been created to better illustrate my question however it does reflect a real life scenario which we would like feedback retrieve all data from the database and place it into an a object represents a single record and if multiple records exist in the we place the data into a of the record say we have the following public class public bool public string public string public public class public bool public string public string public string note that the getters and setters have been omitted from the classes for the sake of before any code police accuse me of not using please note that have been left out for this example database has a table for employees and another for employee what we do is to create a list object that represents the data in the database we do a deep clone of this object which we then bind to controls on the front we then have two objects and representing data from the user then makes changes to the object by deleting we then want to persist these changes to the we want to be as elegant as only deleting those records that require ultimately want to compare the two list objects so that we what properties have changed so that the changes can be persisted to the what properties no longer exist in the second so that these records can be deleted from the what new properties exist in the new so that we can create these in the wants to get the ball rolling on how we can best achieve keep in mind that we also need to drill down into the list to check for any not just the top level hope i have made myself clear and look forward to any object equality for database

went through this recently while decoupling much the same thing from our ui can see my progress and my a does represent business data pulled directly from the business logic turns that data into a truly useful business first is to decouple the datatable from the business can do that by creating objects and that make up datatables and collections of and then you can make a listview that displays those i cover the latter steps in the links i posted and the former steps are as easy as the a class that will represent your through your datatable or however you retrieve the and shove those fields into properties of that object that that list to the gridview or listview to way your listview or gridview be tightly coupled to the method that you are retrieving your what happens if you decide to get your data from a json query or a xml file later then have to build this into 1 getting data from are multiple methods to get data from a no way i can go through all of them i assume that you already know how to retrieve data from a and if you there are a few to pretend connected to the and are using an to retrieve pick up the private void foos if else catch throw new column does not exist in that you can return a list by going through that process in a loop that targets the you do pretend that your being returned is a if you do and follow the first link i gave you can replace with and achieve the same result minor the class just contains the column names in the so you have one place to change them case you were update based on can always insert an intermediate in this insert a business layer between the datatable and the and discussed what do but a datatable is not a business it is a visual representation of a you transport that to the ui layer and call it they say you have to

wpf it was possible to organise the xaml for multiple user controls by keeping the markup in separate xaml files in the themes folder and then using mergeddictionaries to import them into the availability of the silverlight 3 beta introducing merged dictionary it seemed like it might be possible to do the same with silverlight user but despite trying all combinations of build action on the merged dictionary files and the corresponding syntax for the source reference in i seem to get it anyone else does anyone know if it is possible and if so what i am doing so after numerous test getting working samples in wpf and moving the xaml and code over to silverlight 3 and it still i did a full uninstall and reinstall of all the silverlight 2 bits and all the silverlight 3 beta bits and finally got things can only assume that i somehow ended up with a faulty install of the beta i know but it seemed like i was still running in the silverlight 2 runtime despite apparently having the version 3 runtime jared for taking a look at things and checking with the sl3 thanks to and for producing the instructions and batch files for running silverlight 2 3 on the same mergeddictionaries in in silverlight	
wpf use the installed color profile in windows for correcting the colors that are pretty sure old applications are not color but i wonder if wpf does can be made to this know i can do this manually in my own wpf apps by creating a gpu shader to do the color reason i ask is because more and more monitors are now wide this means that colors that look on monitors will seem much more vibrant on wide gamut an example is my new monitor which has much stronger red and green colors than my other can correct this problem on a basis for some applications media players using a custom shader my own wpf apps using gpu but it would be nice if there was a way to have wpf do it automatically for all wpf is not a big problem but it is however annoying and i had hoped that microsoft would take the opportunity with wpf to introduce color correction by question clarified for wpf use the installed color in

you are really running into compilation slowdowns because of header the other option is to use an instead of an this is a rather unpopular approach since it degrades type if you do take this then i would also recommend adding code to programmatically do the bounds in class1 enum blah this is always eone klastblah this is always in check typename t u u castvalue if lower castvalue throw return end check in class2 void in not the prettiest but it does solve the header dependency problem by moving some of the type safety that static compilation gives you into runtime use similar approaches in the past and found that a namespace used in this way can make the resulting code almost as readable as based code with very little caveat is that you do have to make an effort to write code which i recommend regardless of whether you adopt this approach or not

you can play signed urls in flash no reading around i have managed to answer a couple of my own questions yes not a good idea to sign urls from within flash as the secret key would need to be in the swf or loaded from php so could be a security risk it is probably best to call a php method on the server to generate a signed url and return the file to flash return the path to the file but this does seem like an extra step that could be bypassed still not sure about this but i think that the signing process involves using the path to the file so each signature for each url is unique is this have further advice on

you happen to be in the then its a lot easier for an iphone developer to put their apps but if you are not from its a very frustrating especially if you are from a country which does not have its own happen to be from india and i have spent over 40 days just to ensure my card was i have faxed my docs over 7 times to usa and i must have emailed them over 30 times just to ensure my card was must have called their usa telephone number at least 5 and not even once did anyon e the answering machine keeps you on hold for over 30 long minutes and you finally have to disconnect coz you cant take it any more official email for dev support has never responded to a single email of thing to happen was i got an email from their australian office telling me my credit card was this was a big joke as my card has a balance of over 1500 usd and i use it all the time on american sites like amazon and i confirmed with my card bank hsbc and they said there was no attempt to charge my after many more phone calls and emails they charged the same card this time around its really surprising how it got rejected i am in the second phase to get a usa ein i have no clue how much more time apple would take just so that i can start selling my apps on the app i do not understand what on earth makes apple ask their developers to handle all these there are 100 other usa based companies which let u sell stuff online but you are isolated from all this legal way apple rejects app submissions is ridiculous the entire blogosphere has written stories of the they have no standard rules of rejecting your has to soon change the way its dealing with developers otherwise its not gonna take too much time for some other company to eat into its own reports suggest android is picking up market share right iphone is way ahead of the rest trust we live in a world today which is fast and least tolerant to such screw it wont take too much time for a google or for a microsoft or for couple of young smart college kids to roll their own version of the app store and kill app have been a microsoft developer for the last 8 and i have been hearing all sort of crap about of which perhaps is for a change i choose apple coz i sensed a big opportunity on the but so far its been very to microsoft has been a thousand times better than apple as far as developer support in india is no matter what people talk about the fact is on my own experience in last few no company matches microsoft when it comes to supporting their they make it super easy to download and preview their latest their documentation is top before the sdk comes the documentation is up and live on they have local groups in virtually every important city in india the worst policy apple has is as a you have to pay their payments are not on time to i can only hope apple realises that developers hold the key to getting mega bucks in the tech world

you were to look at how a struct stores its it would be something like where your float is where your char is where your int is when you change the value of you are actually changing bytes when you change your you are actually changing byte when you change your you are actually changing bytes you now look at how a union stores its it would be something like where your float is where your char is where your int is when i change the value of i am changing bytes since c is stored in byte when you change you also change c and when you change changing part of f and a and when you change changing c and where your is when you pack the 3 values into the one memory not at just creating 3 different ways of looking at and changing the same you really have an a and a char in that union at the physical just got 32 which could be viewed as an a or a changing one is to change the if you want them to change each then use a is why gcc tells you that your struct is 9 bytes while your union is only 4 not saving space just that structs and unions are not the same

you will write that do important for any realistic interaction with the for if a string field has a constraint that it must always be then at least one of your methods must make a call to or and in your class you probably want to use this to make sure that the constraint is there will also be times when you need to circumvent that preprocessing in i have seen times when developers inadvertently create infinite loops by using the public property rather than the private field think of an example off the top of my to sql generated classes are a good i because they show how much logic can exist in a try writing some extension methods and begin to understand the think the bottom line is that it depends on what kind of logic you are using at any given point in the and what kind of preprocessing exists in the if you are ever unsure or it seems like it it is probably better to use the property so that you write more maintainable code that will follow constraints added
