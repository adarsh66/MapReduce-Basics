a brief search i found an example of sending notifications using the new string sessionkey looking through the codeplex source clear that this sends a and therefore requires an active user session of the does not appear to support notifications which do not require a but adding this feature would be add a type variable to the send method and set it accordingly based on the api documentation source code for the method in the codeplex developer toolkit is keep in mind that the codeplex developer toolkit source code has not been updated in over 3 this means that it does not support many new facebook api features and you may want to browse the client library wiki page to find a library that is more up to

a clue that might your comment about the difference between an editable list and a readonly list got me so i dug a little on what i could tell from digging into the csla businesslistbase implements iqueryable in the csla as in the readonlylistbase class does may affect which dynamic linq orderby extension method is being called are and the one for iqueryable simply calls the version of orderby for the regular the other if you follow the trail of iqueryable in the provider property type delegates to the iqueryprovider get return new of that to with the limited time i had to i think delving further a into the csla linq stuff is probably from other discussion and i saw you also pointed to a recorded for the issue id 326 orderby should return a linqbindinglist that works with bound issue id 326 orderby should return a linqbindinglist that works with bound suspicion is that it has more to do with implementation of iqueryable than anything and it look like readonlylistbase implement either directly or via inheritance my copy of csla that

a dictionary there is one general you can do to greatly reduce the dictionary comparisons ahead of that the above grid contains only 16 some of them you can greatly reduce the number of total keys in your dictionary by simply filtering out entries that have unattainable thought this was the obvious optimization but seeing nobody did it mentioning reduced me from a dictionary of keys to only keys simply during the input this at the very least reduces memory and sure to map to a speed increase somewhere as memory infinitely implementation is a bit because i placed importance on being able to know the exact path of every extracted not just the validity also have a few adaptions in there that would theoretically permit a grid with holes in it to and grids with different sized lines assuming you get the input right and it lines up somehow is by far the most bottleneck in my as suspected commenting out that line bloats it from to execution it appears to think all the single digits are on their own valid but pretty sure thats due to how the dictionary file a bit but at least i reuse from of it was inspired partially by the existing some of it i had in mind criticism and ways it could be improved welcome notes he never cpan for a boggle but this was more fun to work out for new this package manages a given path through the its an array of convenience functions for the and for extending paths as new my my print package use has path isa is default sub has isa is create a clone of this with a longer sub child my my my have to do this manually or other recorded paths get push return traverses to get the string it sub my return join map returns the rightmost node on this sub tail my return sub my my map return sub pp my return basic package for tracking node without having to look on the i could have just used an array or a but that got once the matrix is up and running it really care so much about its just a sea of points and each point has adjacent relative positioning is only really useful to map it back to package use has isa is required 1 has isa is required 1 has value isa is required 1 has siblings isa is default sub its not implicitly it would be more effient in to make the link go both ways at the same but thats too hard to program and this slow enough to bother caring sub my my push convenience method to derive a path starting at this sub my return path package use has rows isa is default sub has regex isa is has cells isa is sub my push most of these functions from here down are just builder or utilities to help build some just broken out to make it easier for me to all thats really useful is the rest will generally be and ready to from by the time either or are traverse all cells and make a regex that covers sub my my for my return convert a plain cell 0 to an intelligent cell y we only really keep them in this format so we can go through and tie in neighbouring after the neigbouring is the grid should be considered sub my my my my my value return go through the presently available and freeze them into sub my my my for my 0 next unless defined my for my 0 next unless defined push for my for my return given return array of points that refer to valid sub my my my my for my 1 next if next if not defined for my 1 next if 0 next if next if not defined push return sub my my return defined sub my my my return defined sub my my my return sub my my my my return readdict my my my dictionary open my while my commenting the next line makes it go from seconds to next if early return traversegraph my my my my my inject all grid nodes into the processing my grep map while my shift put the dictionary into my my if push push current path into if it exactly next if put the dictionary into foreach my foreach my next siblingloop if given path y iterate for all its end my create a new path for each if if the new path is a add it to the bottom of the push return my my 0 f x i e a m l o e w b x a s t u return 1 d g h i k l p s y e u t e o r n return my my srand my 1 4 my 1 4 push here is where the real work 0 5 scalar get the as per join map info for name duo cpu t9300 size 6144 usage heap heap stack total calls total memory failed 947212 68763684 11191 1045641 0 121001 7248252 973159 for block 392633 43530 50048 70701 18831 19271 238398 3007 236727 mumblings on that regex regex optimization i use is useless for and for want a full not a that for its really perl regex are in is some varying code my my my dictionary open my while my return use benchmark cmpthese generate a random 16 character string to simulate there being an input my sub my my push my join return 200 filtered sub unfiltered sub unfiltered 200 27

a little we have an intranet site based on wss that is hosted on a server in and set up to use integrated windows authentication to authenticate users against active directory user accounts of setup works just fine for users who are logged into windows using an ad account from but when users try to access the site from a pc logged into windows using an ad account from a different domain the following problems user must manually enter their credentials as rather than just because internet explorer automatically inserts and causes authentication to logged if the user does something that requires the browser to pass their authentication through to a client such as clicking on a microsoft office document in a document library in order to open it for it appears that invalid credentials are passed thus forcing the user to manually enter their credentials then is there any way to implement a type of behavior when using integrated windows authentication can be done when using basic clear text so that if a user on does not enter a domain before their user is inserted automatically for i realize this deployment may be fatally so i am also open to suggestions for a different the main problem stems from two different kinds of users needing to access the same content on one sharepoint the users in all have their own workstations where they log into windows as the users in unfortunately have to use shared computers that are logged on using generic type accounts that have no permissions in sharepoint thus the requirement that the users must provide their credentials on demand when accessing a given page in i would like to preserve the convenience of the integrated windows authentication for the users of while minimizing the amount of manual authentication that the users in have to authentication across multiple

adding the nsurlrequestreloadignoringlocalandremotecachedata parameter you are instructing the local cache and any proxy servers which may handle the request between your client and the target server that they are not to return their own version of the response i think the here is that the remotecache is likely to be a proxy and you are just identifying that the request should always reach the real server and not a proxied the parameter you are inferring that your application already has a previous copy of the request and so is only interested in actually receiving data from the server if it has that is why you are getting a response of not from the behaviour does seem as you are explicitly instructing the client not to use its own which would imply that you would want to discard anything in there and certainly not use it as a reference for any subsequent i believe the advanced cache parameters are provided to allow the developer to handle their own level of be notified if data been updated on the server so they can avoid needless

all your javascript into one external file can do this dynamically and save the cached that that file use the mtime of a preconfigured file for the file if the client supports a far futures expires header on the referring to ajax libraries is another way to handle this that falls under the heading of a cdn delivery the idea being that the file is stored in multiple plallllces and the client will download the closest that result will be hard or just awkward to combine with other techniques and found that doing multiple external loads this way completely erodes any perceived benefit your only external so i use the method listed above

always best to load as much as is reasonable on the initial if your requires that you add stuff dynamically via ajax then i can see you what i you are wondering what the practice would be to keep your javascript concise and in on file and not scattered throughout your you are saying that currently your scripts are scattered throughout your page because when you are loading in or whatever they have the js along with them so that when they load their script is run the problem is that you want specific events to be triggered instantiating a lightbox or sorting a when these views are loaded by using the one omnipotent super global js if that sounds then what do any views being loaded in assume you have the code you you loaded some content into the div a when the page is fully and then you wanted to sort that table without putting the script to do so in the html that is returned from you could have the following code in you main or whatever your sorting method uses jquery custom events and the i tested this out but it should work in i tested this and it works perfectly using jquery

am creating a wcf service that will be consumed by both and java client do not have any java experience in the so are looking for guidelines or rules to follow to ensure that we do not accidentally include any types in our wcf service interface or do anything else that would preclude it from being consumed by a java client our worries if what should we be wary example of a concern is whether a value is represented in the service interface in a manner that can be correctly understood by a java second example of a concern is the use of any nullable value types present some of our development teams are files to define the various objects that the wcf interface methods will take as arguments and return as return they are then using to classes from rationale behind this is that it guarantees that the generated classes contain anything that is downside is that this adds a development burden and also precludes us from documenting these classes using tags equivalent of javadoc that a wcf service can be consumed by a java

am looking for a specific hashcode that has the following i dont know of any such hashcodes and i dont know if it is possible to do such a just wanted to put it out there and see what people have two databases used term dont think of sql or anything of that one master and one there is a need to keep the two databases in sync and to detect when the databases are not in instead of verifying every data in it would be preferable to keep some hashcode that can be but the two databases dont necessarily share every since changes from master to backup are it is possible that certain modifications from the master to backup are lets say current state of database has elements and now b gets modified such that and then later the only change that will get sent from master to backup is the intermediate is instead of looping over every element in each database to verify that they we would prefer to keep a running hash code of the elements in both the locations and then just compare the hashcode would have to compute something previous hashcode of hm1 b changes hm2 hm3 master will have hashcode of now backup will not receive the modification so if it computes a running hash it will be like hb1 hb2 we want hb2 and hm3 to as the current state of the databases are the but most not hashcodes dont work this what we would want then is that we would want to the contribution of from the hash first and then the contribution of and then remove contribution of and add the contribution of into the hash so we want something like f modifies existing hashcode by adding contribution of a new while g modifies existing hashcode by removing contribution of an b gets modified to b get modified to is the new hashcode for the current state of the database b gets modified to hm5 and hb3 should as the current state of both databases is the are there such algorithms f and i hope i made the question function with reversible

am posting this as an answer so i can explain how i did it and the answer from mitch wheat was the one that gave me the best solution for this case and i just had to modify it slightly due to the format this data was exported is the vb fixedcontents as string addressof regex that was used is what i needed to change because certain fields had quotes in them and the regex provided seem to work on all this one uses and to see if the quote is just after a comma or just in this they are both negative show me where the double quote is not before or after a this should mean that the quote is in the middle of a this instead of doing a direct i am using the function replacequotes to handle that for the reason i am using this is because i needed a little extra logic to detect whether it was at the beginning of a if i would have spent even more time on i am sure i could have tweaked the regex to take into consideration the beginning of the line but when i tried it it seem to work at this in using csv reader on a 32mb csv file 19000 it takes about 2 seconds to read the perform the load it into the csv add all the data to my generic class and real

an alternative was faced with the exact same problem at work i wasted a good week in trying to figure the best way to do i ended up with creating a join as you have but the table contains only instead of keeping track of status quo is has read all their the unread messages their should be as fast as status quo should be the least straining status on the if i kept track of all the messages everyone has the clutter in the database grows pretty rapidly easily leading to thousands of rows of in even smaller this problem is exaggerated if the lifetime of messages are indefinite you could be keeping track of message statuses that are many years keeping track of the your table contains only a handful of and they diminish for each message that a user getting the amount of unread messages is as simple as from unread where user this is a while reading is pretty much as fast as computationally writing is a for each written you need to insert an entry to this join if multiple people can read the same you need to insert one row for each if the recipients are implicit only a user name is or even with the criteria such as who has access to this creating new messages becomes even more i feel this is a fair

an interesting but like bobince you can only process one attribute per this regex will match everything up to the attribute interested you use as your replacement string to plug back in everything but the approach requires you to make a separate pass over the string for each of your target and at the beginning of each pass you have to create and compile the not very but if the string too large it should be a much bigger problem is that it catch duplicate if there are two attributes on a only catch the first i were doing this in i would probably use the regex to match the target then use a matchevaluator to remove all of the target attributes at but if the string really is no excuse for not using tools to process is what xml was

answer to your question really depends upon the purpose of your regular expressions are great and i with all the previous answers i have regular is a quick and sleak way to validate certain inputs but perhaps what you need to remember what makes good code and apply the regular expressions in the correct i read the article you and i thought the subject matter was about more about using regular expressions in the correct manner just use them for a solution because you know it will be quick to type up and it will work but in turn produces lengthy and horrible looking take it from what is written that regular expressions are i he just wanted to put accross that sometimes you can spend a few more minutes considering design and come up with a better concept to implement or just conclude that regular expressions are that

app needs to keep an index of files in which the files are known by tags and suggesting a lucene document schema i s i i actual file is looked up by id in while a file has only one set of it may have multiple versions of its content identified by a only real solution it seems is one document with one document for each version such that the tags and attributes are redundant across many i i i i concern about this schema is whether it will be performant enough and compact so here are my i understand indexing scheme when the same long string is indexed as a field in many this really bulk out the index compared to if it were indexed just i create a single term make it and then add it to many does the full string data get duplicated for each document in the if this is the am i just best off putting the actual storage of the into far as i can the only info that comes back in query results is the documents themselves ordered by to determine which fields satisfied the query for a matched must i do separate queries on the fields for each or that this is just a so concurrent access is a and index updates will be quite infrequent time the user retags or a mainly concerned about response for a single user and to some extent about index size more for conserving memory rather than disk considered some alternative document but rejected my initial instinct was to avoid data duplication by splitting documents into two one type for representing a i i i then one document type for representing the of i i are a number of problems with it requires doing separate queries for content and and then matching content results to for each version document in my i must look at its fileid to then look up the corresponding file document in a separate while this is a standard relational my understanding is that a rather awkward and slow thing to do in for a query requiring both and i want to get back the file versions that include both those terms in either the or content in one and in the by splitting the from their this becomes very tricky likely maybe i can just keep content and together by keeping multiple content i i i i question is whether i can identify a content field so i can know which version content produced the i could name each content field corresponding to the version i i i i if i could identify the content that caused the document to match the consolidating the versions messes up the and attributes in lucene shared across

are valid choices depending on architecting for extensibility say a plugin model for different imagereaders then your factory class cannot know about all possible in that you go the route asking each implementer until you find one that can read that sometimes ordering does matter you may have a genericimagereader that can handle but a jpeg2000imagereader that is better at walking the imagereader implementers will stop at whichever is you may want to look at sorting the list of possible imagereaders if a if the list of imagereaders is finite and under your then you can go the more traditional factory in that the factory decides what to already coupled to the concrete implementations of imagereader by the so adding rules for each imagereader increase if the logic to pick a imagereader is mainly in the imagereader then to avoid duplication of you can still go the route but it could just be hardcoded which types you

benchmarks so far show java and c are about on par with each your benchmarks are severely will always be orders of magnitudes faster then both and java unless you do something seriously that this is not an attempt to try to bully neither nor i like both java and and there are other reasons why you would for many problems choose either java or instead of but neither java nor would in a correct written tests never be able to perform with the same speed as because of the sheer number of comments arguing against my these two class public int public static void y new int idx new this one int myclass int idx idx version first of all needs to store its array on the the c version stores the array on the to store stuff on the stack is merely changing the value of an integer value while to store stuff on the heap means finding a big enough chunk of memory and potentially means traversing the memory for a pretty long mostly and java allocates huge chunks of memory which they keep on spending till out which makes this logic execute but even then to compare this against changing the value of an integer is like an f16 against an oil tanker of all in the c version since all those objects are already on the stack we need to explicitly create new objects within the yet again for this is a for available memory while the c version is a zip nothing of all is the fact that the c version will automatically delete all these objects when they run out of yet again this is an operation which changes the value of an integer which would on most cpu architectures take between 1 and 3 cpu the version do but when the garbage collector kicks in and needs to collect those items my guess is that talking about of cpu the c version will instantly become x86 code an x86 while the version would first become il then later when executed it would have to be jit which probably alone takes orders of magnitudes longer time then only executing the c some wise guy could probably execute the above code and measure cpu however basically no point at all in doing because mathematically proven that the managed version would probably take several million times the number of cpu cycles as the c so my guess is that now talking about orders of magnitudes slower in this and this is a in that i for something to prove my however i challenge those that commented badly against me on this post to create a sample which does not execute faster in c and which also use constructs which you normally never would use in c due to that and java are great i prefer them over c time of the but not because because they are they are slower then c and unless coded blindfolded in c or of course have the which would seriously change the speed for the above if we changed the class to a value type by using the keyword instead of the struct keyword means that would store new objects of the given type on the stack which for the above sample would increase the speed still the above sample happens to also feature an array of these though if we went through and optimized the version like we would still end up with something several orders of magnitudes slower then the c written piece of c code will be faster then python and i i love and most of the work i do today is and not however i use because faster then i use because i need the speed gain c gives me for most of my and java is though slower then and for that

big thing to keep in mind is that forms authentication works based on when the client browser sends a request to the it sends the cookie with each if the server requires a specific cookie makes this a requirement if enforcing authentication on a particular and the cookie this is when you get the unauthorized order to get your jquery the client has to request it from a host which could be an page that is protected via forms this is the first step securing access to the jquery code the next thing you need to do is secure access to the restful you put the endpoint hosting the restful wcf service in in the same directory as part of your application that is being protected by forms authentication via then will reject requests to the endpoint before wcf is told about the in this you can wrap your wcf service in forms authentication without having to do any complicated coding within the when making http requests of your is doing so from within the context of your http requests made from jquery long as the jquery was loaded from the same root as your forms authenticated will contain the authentication

both like and dislike are great for organising code into general areas such as etc and then hiding them away great for stuff like control development were there are usually a lot of properties with and be used if following a notify property change they are great when you are implementing several interfaces and you want to group the interface implementations separately from the main they do get in the way when you want to see the entirety of the code or you are browsing through it looking for and even worse when someone code and they agree with your conventions for naming and grouping i would like to see is an easily accessible feature in visual studio that allowed a and toggling option so i could have the best of both worlds when it suited perhaps such things will be easy to implement as extensions to the ide in	
bottom line issue is that world wide web desktop application no matter how much want it to numerous issues these are some which pop into is desktop applications www is made stateful usually by uri parameters and session management and now that those for a couple of mostly gone over the issue of pages are described with some form of xml and usually in which the page is described as a comparing to desktop while possibly to do nearly the same with xml and just plain component it just the once again one of the biggest issues is that in da those are stateful by nature on the level while in www you can be truly stateful on the level at most and even that requires direct use of layout managers is a assuming the web ui framework using allows you may create something that behaves quite similarly to layout while i know about gwt i believe that one could do at least a simple layout manager in jsp my and make it behave just as the swing layout managers that i really do mean the whole concept of layout managers here as a set of specialized just as peter gwt support them directly fact i heard anything beyond swing and i believe it would be more of an effort to create a for swing layout managers instead of just creating your properietary ones for

c function prototype simply wants a pointer to a buffer and the size of the what it expects to see inside the buffer is the my assumption wild guess is that the bitmap bits in a bytearray guess this needs to be broken down into but i think the general idea is get the data from your into probably a byte allocate an unmanaged buffer to store the copy the byte array to the pass the buffer pointer to your c free the buffer when you are can allocate an unmanaged buffer using pnt you can copy your byte array because its unmanaged you will be responsible for freeing it when you are as if you have access to the c it would be much better to simply pass the bitmap handle

can tell you what worked for me on a commercial board game style your representation of the board and core game logic into own with well defined interfaces to the rest of the we had functions like bool and bool along with interfaces back to the gui such as board and rules only knew the state of the and what was valid to it know anything about or anything each we would handle input from the user at the gui send commands to the state and then be the game state code would get resolve if they were valid or update the game state and then send messages back to the gui to visually represent the new state of teh these updates were queued by the visual representation so we could batch a bunch of animations to happen in good thing about this is that the board know or care about human ai your ai can be a separate submodule that acts on it can send the same commands as the human and the game logic and visual results will be the need to either have a local bit of info about the game board or expose some functionality from the game logic that lets the ai the but you could register each ai as an observer pattern on the game so they get notified when the board updates as in case they need to do any complex realtime each section of your game separate and isolated will help with unit and provide a more robust well defined interfaces are your	
can think of an interface as an abstract class that only provides constant and method prototype classes can then implement interfaces in the same way they can inherit from other when implementing an a class must implement all methods defined in the interface void class myclass public void obj new of the nice things about interfaces is that they support multiple unlike classes in so you can implement several interfaces and interfaces can extend several other naming convention for interfaces in is so you can guess that a symbol is an interface if it starts with an many interfaces have names that end on like or concept is the same as in you can read more about it

finding all descendents of a row with mptt is finding all children can be however you should be able to fix that by adding a field to your table that records the parent of the then the search contains redundant potentially denormalizing your table but since any already requires global keeping much extra to you could alternatively use a field that records the vertical level of the although that is in fact likely to change under certain types of transformations moving a subtree to a different point in the plain old representation just having and no or is of course faster for but the only queries it can answer efficiently are the parent of and the children of most workloads involve much more reading than so usually mptt is faster overall but perhaps in your case you need to consider moving to

first thing to note is that user agent sniffing does not just mean looking at it is a general term to describe the large array of methods that people use to change behaviour based on what they believe the browser the problem is looking at the user agent the problem is deciding what your site should do based on what you think the browser this means you may unavoidably limit or break your site in the for instance i have seen multiple canvas demos which block they checking to see whether canvas is they are explicitly looking for and if they see it they say ie is this means that even if ie did eventually support canvas these sites still than browser sniffing you should always attempt to detect the feature or bug you are interested the most common example of these tests is is how the existence of canvas should be and will correctly pick up canvas in any even if current versions support

get the feeling that firefox grabs a bunch of memory for itself and release it unless it has it may be apparent that my understanding of memory management in general is very at 1 point firefox requires a lot of say after it require so many your system do not need this it does not reclaim it to which keeps ever you launch other processes that need a lot of then your os will claim back memory to other processes that are running with a high summarize my ideas probably not a memory there another browser which will use less memory if it need you try

get to work with a number of mostly with developers and sometimes directly with the one thing that comes up often is that when architects prescribe an application they want it to be followed consistently every time with little to no room for good example of this is the presentation model when i think of this i think of it as have an object model to represent the state and behaviors of the current and a view object that surfaces it to the in my the things representing the state is more conceptual than a prescriptive a view might use many objects to represent this or it might use or perhaps it is so simple that it needs or perhaps it shares the ethos of the pattern is that we seperate the state management from the visualization often what i come across is the patterns being intepreted much more a typical project might look like the model object is or the viewmodel is just forwarding property to the model sometimes the view is so that the extra objects just make it more complicated than it needs to do you prefer developers follow the same process every time like a or do you prefer to leave the details up to the much autonomy do you give developers in applying

going to try to explain the best i can arrays in their fundamental so an array is basically a way to store for instance if you want a list of shopping we would use a one dimensional index holds a specific the data as you can see are represented as now i use something like this will put an integer as index the compiler will tell you that no good and you need to fix that on to matrices or take a piece of squared paper like the ones you use for math and draw a cartesian system and some put the coordinates on different piece of paper and next to them put a for this means is that at index i have a representation would be like system in form of a matrices 1 1 0 0 0 0 used just simple arrays to illustrate what are for example if you want to go 3d the data structure for that would be a array of matrices aka a list which holds each cartesian location at a specific we had as height and the same dots as above it would be something you want a way to grab a simple list of problems and try to implement them using arrays of any there is no quick way to do just have patience and

good would only add data this might even be easier in because if is with oop is trying to encourage you to take every noun verb in your head and turn it into a class that can be very suppose you have an array of temperature readings at points in and you want to display them as a in windows has a paint and when you receive you can loop through the array doing lineto scaling the data as you go to convert it to pixel i have seen entirely too many times since the chart consists of points and people will build up a data structure consisting of point objects and line each capable of and then make that on the theory that that is somehow or that they just have to be able to mouse over parts of the chart and display the data so they build methods into the objects to deal with and of involves creating and deleting even more you end up with a huge amount of code that is and merely spends of time managing of this gets done in the name of programming and least in c the efficient way will be more and the temptation to build pyramids less

have a rails application where i would like to use both memcached and the file store for different want to use the file store cache to keep a large number of pages that change often not at page caching and use memcached for everything else and db caching the reason is that the pages stored on the file store cache are likely to require a large amount of but individually most will be accessed this possible to do or will configuring memcached as the cache mean that it is also used for page a secondary what is a safe way to remove pages from the file store cache in some form of cron as there does not seem to be an option to specify ttl for this for example a unix find command would quickly find and remove all old pages or pages that been accessed in a long time is this safe to do given the app server might potentially try to serve one of those pages at the time this is very if not then what is the best way to do to use multiple caches in

have an application that performs a write to a database each time a page is this db write is not time so for performance i have the page queuing the object using of i have to have something to read the queue and process so i wrote a class that looks similar to class queueprocessor public void create background thread to run public void stop the previously created public void while check queue for process them one at a then wait indefinitely for more since this web site is fairly small in i realy want to have to add a windows service to the deployment so what doing at this time is creating a new queueprocessor in the event and starting it my thought is that the thread will run for the life of the and if the application gets killed by it will merely start up again the next time someone accesses a prevent long periods of idle where queued messages are not processed because the application has been killed by set up a wget request to execute every few minutes on one of the thus keeping the application alive and ensuring the background thread will keep question i see this design very and wondering if there are any potential problems with doing some reading on the i found that the major problem with this approach similar such as the cache removal callback is the type of function they were being asked to perform with regards to for if doing a mass update or you obviously want the task running on all of your web servers have conflicting updates and potential data loss that in my very particular the thread is processing only requests received by that server that are sitting in that message if i were to scale this app to say 5 each thread would process each queued messages without any the order of the records in the database so important that a few similar requests from different servers within a small interval would be a so i still think this solution is reasonable for my threading design

i recall there is a vector table in the beginning of memory space that points to the routine to call when a specific interrupt i may be hitting at too low a level here x86 assembly but at the base level you get your vector installed in that table then your routine is not got any of my old reference material with me so give you the actual calls but be surprised if the official method operated outside of the these days of guis sure there are more appropriate that allow interrupt sharing and all that good ignore much of just seen that you are looking at interrupt 16 and above which are outside of the hardware i moved away from that level of programming before there were any interesting bits of hardware in that space so i only ever dealt with the first 15 irqs 16th being the cascade between leaving it just in case of interest to anyone else	
i reorganized my adobe air project as a maven project so i could hook into my continuous integration most of the information i found to get it working came from various which seems to be the only way to go as far as flex stuff is i was deciding which to inherit i found that there are a bunch of different flexmojos that different people are are a few that i found each of these in use by some examples in the is the one i is the difference between the various and which is the de facto version of flexmojos should be

i strongly recommend that you use getting a syntax check that your parens are balanced as well as your in your you have an the but no you can fix that be just removing the you fix likely get some more errors like not in an aggregate or group because you have several columns that are not in you need to add to your group by or perform some kind of aggregate on is all assuming that there are multiple records with the same threadid not the primary if the then the purpose of the group stumped on the syntax i worked around it with a couple correlated sub i guessed at your table structure so modify as needed and try table threadrating int not userid int not rating int not table thread int not rating int not voters int not trigger on from threadrating i where from threadrating i where inserted on what you then we can check the plan and modify as we might be able to get it to work with the group by to you are updating data that impact ratings in only a few select recommend updating the ratings directly factoring the logic into a trigger is nice but provides lots of problems this can be aided by a your trigger will execute every single time someone touches that things like view last updated will execute this you can add logic to short circuit the trigger in those cases but it gets complicated

i think much about but always on my biggest problem always had with parallel processing is determing what should be easy to a thread to background process a but can the file processing itself be think the questions of what can and should be parallelized are answered with complex architectural decisions layered on top of the already complex architectural decisions of the application in my belief is that this complexity will be solved either by the os or by the programming the traditional thread model of parallelization found in c and its descendants is not the final

i was too late on the answer for this but i was working a little test scenario that seems to have worked very well for i used a but and regular expression to locate all the words for the expression is as here with line breaks for formatting my method was to execute this regex with a library like and then read back the named and it worked on all of the different examples listed in this minus the as i add them but as you can it be hard to do this addresses a lot of for it addresses the following items in the original question and other or and spelling that it does not explicitly address that would be something want to do before you passed the string to this this parser sees this example as 2100 one and also thousand and one hundred fifty but also or and also is not totally as what is this code finds this number as simply rather than store this monster of a regular expression in your i was considering building this regex at using something like the so easy part here is we are only storing the words that in the case of notice that there an entry for because just normal number with th tacked but ones like twelve need different so now we have the code to build our now we just execute it on our number thing i would is to or eat the word not and only leads to other what you are going to want to do is setup a function that passes the named matches for into a function that looks at all the possible magnitude and multiplies your current result by that value of you create a function that looks at the named and returns an int whatever you are based on the value discovered value matches are added to your while magnitutde matches multiply the result by the mag two hundred fifty thousand becomes then then then ending up with for i wrote a vbscript version of this and it worked great with all the examples it support named so i had to work a little harder getting the correct but i got bottom line if a add it your if a magnitude multiply your accumulator by this will provide you with some pretty amazing and all you have to do to adjust for things like is add them to your put in a code marker for and handle i hope this post helps someone out if anyone i can post by vbscript pseudo code that i used to test this not pretty and not production i what is the final language this will be written or something like a scripted greg source will go a long way in helping understand how all of this comes me know if i can be of any other i only know so i help you with the other

i would step in since i write email software for a are two common scenarios for smtp to server and to to public server to server email communication takes place over port if you want your domain to receive email from other then you have to accept smtp traffic at port this is sent as clear there are ways of encoding the specific but as far as the it is sent as ascii text in binary it is not sent over is also some private server to server communication that can take this might take place in large where they might have the internal corporate server that every one when you send an it is sent to the corporate but then this corporate server forwards the email off to a public facing that public facing server sends the email off to a receiving that receiving server is accepting email at port to has more on the server you can configure different submission ports ports you will accept email these can be anything you want them to you just have to remember to tell your users to configure the client software the most common ports are 25 and a lot of isps will block outgoing port 25 that is what spam bots use to send to public mail they have 587 open so you can send email to your smtp the common port for smtp over ssl is this can get a lot more and left out a good bit of but it in a

idea of storing connection strings in a data base is a perverse but please hear me out we all know that best practice to encrypt connection strings in the but what if we just skip the file couple of months ago i was asked to move databases from one server to this meant having to update connection strings in every program that accessed these various this is the 3rd time in 2 years had to move databases from one server to so i thought of storing connection strings in a database and assigning each a guid to be accessed via a web instead of placing connection strings in a you would just need to store the connection string guid in the and reference the connection string web service so that you could request that connection encryption can be done at the application level and connection strings are just stored encrypted in the created a proof of concept and it works fine just on a local intranet and not exposed to the benefit is obvious to such as being able to quickly update connection strings without having to touch the web this means that you could build a web application just for editing connection string in the that a dba could use on there so they never have to bother a programmer when moving the benefit is not what interested interested in what everyone here thinks about doing something like connection strings via a web

if this is obvious or covered but been googling all day and found a solution that actually problem is as i am currently drawing an image in a full screen for examples sake say the image is in the bottom right corner of the like to do a rotation at the center of that by default the rotation command rotates around the center of the uiview it as a my image moves around the screen when i rotate instead of it staying in place and rotating around its own what i need to translate my context so that the of the is at the center of my and then restore the context by translating back to the original following is the closest thing gotten to but the problem is that while the image is it moves downward while i think this is caused by animation tweening the 1st step translate and 3rd step translate instead of just realizing that the beginning and end point on the translates would be the before this make a call to a function that draws a path to a passed in inversetranslation transy translation rot final rot translation then i apply the transformation animation like normal using final etc also tried stuff like cgcontexttranslatectm and but these seem to have little been fighting with this for days and my current solution seems but i have no clue how to get rid of that translating does anyone have a solution for this or a better way to go about the time being drawing my image centered at the center and then setting the property to the origin like to rotate and then doing the rotate seems like a bit of a but until i can get the real translates working my only i move the origin when doing a rotation transform in quartz 2d for the

if your build file is large and complex then this is a clear indication that the way you have your code layed in terms of folders and it complex and too i find that a complex ant script is a clear smell of a poorly laid out code fix think about how your code is laid how many projects do you do those projects know how to build themselves with a master build script that knows how to bundle the individual together into a larger you are refactoring you are looking at ways or breaking things down so that they are easier to smaller methods and classes that do one you need to apply these same principles to your code base as smaller components that are functionally cohesive and are very loosely decoupled from the rest of the use a build script to build that component into a do this with the rest of your now create a master build script that knows how to bundle up all of your libraries and build them into your if you have several then create build script for each app and a master one that knows how to bundle the apps into should be able to see and understand the layout and structure of your code base just by looking at your build if is not clean and understandable then neither is your source

important point when discussing java ee you should be using java ee 5 and since they provide for new level of productivity compared to previous within standard java ee specs is absolutely using hibernate instead of jpa is not beneficial to there is no limitation to fall back to hibernate features when using but by using hibernate instead of jpa you are locked in into single persistence provider with no cheap way the whole idea behind using standards is the conceptual flexibility plugging in different with available extensibility using proprietary extensions if absolutely java ee 5 and ejb3 are huge steps in this of you want to minimize any proprietary features but if some seem absolutely necessary a good sign that they will be part of spec in next obstacles to java ee productivity are in its enterprise focus a lot more than than needed for majority of and in its legacy there is also a lot more to be done in presentation tier with jsf and state management watch for to address these among other

in managed with respect to the graphics is not slimdx pays a slightly penalty over completely native code on each call into but it is by no means the actual penalty depends on the call a call into drawprimitive will be vastly more expensive overall than a call to so you end up losing a lot more on the setrenderstate slimdx incorporates a tuned math library that generally performs very although you have to be a bit careful with even with a junker tool like highlights this stuff very quickly so not difficult to if we consider and code doing rendering via the version is probably within of the hard to achieve consider how much time saving by working in which you can apply to higher level graphics optimizations that you probably simply have time for if you had to build the entire thing in and even if you managed to get that extra in promptly shrink to within a few when a new round of hardware tears through your application code faster than i know what pick which is why i wrote slimdx to begin is subject to similar performance with the caveat that their math library is rather slow in this is an implementation bug that discussed with and will hopefully be fixed before too

inquiry is rather difficult for me to properly but going to give it a shot either currently trying to figure out how to set my to scroll over a and not within their own what i mean by is if you look at the tumblr screenshot actual uitableview above scrolls elegantly against a the dotted the entire table moves in if that makes the default behavior of a uitableview when scrolled in other cases looks more like the following the abundant white space at the bottom of the that screenshot was taken with my dragging the uitableview up as far as i instead of the last cell just dragging with the entire the offset at the bottom gets curious what the trick is in the case of the tumblr application to get the uitableview to scroll with all cells in without creating the abundant white space in the header or footer which vertical direction you scroll is it a uitableview sitting on top of a know uitableview is a subclass of so i figured this would be poor for the this one is driving me up a uitableview on the iphone as seen in the tumblr

is a good easy to install and easy to use from have a system using stompserver in production for sending out emails and processing other jobs saves the emails to the a handler in django sends an event to stompserver and stompserver passes the event to a consumer process which does the asynchronous task the scales up quite nicely because you can add consumer processes at runtime two consumers can send twice as many and the consumers can be on seperate one slight complication is that each consumer needs its own named queue so django needs to know how many consumers are available and send events to each queue in a consumers listening on the same queue will both get each message if you only want one consumer process then this an previously had processes which polled the database continuously for jobs but found that it was adding a lot of load to the even when nothing needed to be

is a pretty standard scheme for asynchronous background processing with vb6 clients and vb6 instance in dan and i think it should work for a client vb6 activex exe object should expose an event this takes a byref boolean called client calls startdostuff in the activex exe this routine starts a timer on a hidden form and this unblocks the calling the timer interval is very short so the timer event fires timer event handler disables the and then calls back into the activex object dostuff this begins the lengthy the dostuff method raises the checkquitdostuff the event handler checks the special flag and sets quit true if necessary to then dostuff aborts the calculation and returns early if quit is scheme means that the client actually need to be since the calling thread block while is the tricky part is making sure that dostuff raises the events at appropriate intervals too and you quit when you want too and you are slowing down dostuff when dostuff it must unload the hidden dostuff does actually manage to get all the stuff done before being you can raise a different event to tell the client that the job is

is the most basic of normal forms each cell in a table must contain only one piece of and there can be no duplicate and 3nf are all about being dependent on the primary recall that a primary key can be made up of multiple as chris said in his data depends on the key the whole key and nothing but the key help me you have a table containing courses that are taken in a certain and you have the following uh oh semesterid course name 100 programming 100 programming 200 databases 150 databases 120 web design is in because the fourth column does not rely upon the key but only a part of the course name is dependent on the but has nothing to do with which semester taken as you can we have duplicate information several rows telling us that it101 is and it102 is so we fix that by moving the course name into another where courseid is the entire key course name programming databases web design so say we also add the name of the teacher of the and some details about into the uh oh semester teacherid teachername 100 332 mr jones 100 332 mr jones 200 495 mr bentley 150 332 mr jones 120 242 mrs smith hopefully it should be obvious that teachername is dependent on teacherid so this is in to fix we do much the same as we did in 2nf take the teachername field out of this and put it in its which has teacherid as the primary key teacherid teachername 332 mr jones 495 mr bentley 242 mrs smith important thing to remember is that if something is not in it is not in 2nf or 3nf so each additional normal form requires that the lower normal forms plus some extra which must be

java way is that you should consider what data most suits your remember that in java a list is an not a concrete data you should declare the strings as a and then initialize it using the arraylist strings new separation of abstract data type and specific implementation is one the key aspects of object oriented arraylist implements the list abstract data type using an array as its underlying access speed is virtually identical to an with the additional advantages of being able to add and subtract elements to a list this is an operation with an and that if you decide to change the underlying implementation later on you for if you realize you need synchronized you can change the implementation to a vector without rewriting all your the arraylist was specifically designed to replace the array construct in most if java was being designed entirely possible that arrays would have been left out altogether in favor of the arraylist arrays keep all the data in a contiguous chunk of memory would the use of an array to store thousands of strings cause problems all collections store only references to not the objects both arrays and arraylist will store a few thousand references in a contiguous so they are essentially you can consider that a contiguous block of a few thousand references will always be readily available on modern this does not guarantee that you will not run out of memory of just that the contiguous block of memory requirement is not difficult to

looking at your i would say that you should reorder the comparison to take advantage of when using boolean stringitem in x comparison of length is always going to be an operation the length is being stored as part of the it count each character every whereas the call to startswith is going to be an where n is the length of query the length of the whichever is placing the comparison of length before the call to if that comparison you save yourself some extra cycles which could add up when processing large numbers of think that a lookup table is going to help you as lookup tables are good when you are comparing the entire not parts of the like you are doing with the call to you might be better off using a tree structure which is split based on the letters in the words in the at that you are really just recreating what sql server is doing the case of and that would just be a duplication of effort on your

make the programming language programming ides really make working with certain languages easier and better to i have been bit spoiled in my professional the companies i worked for always had the latest visual ready to about 8 i have been doing a lot of cocoa next to my work and the xcode editor makes working with that language just way too overloads are difficult to find and the overal way of handling open files just makes your screen really really really a because cocoa is a cool and powerful language to work xcode fans will now vote down my but there are so many ides that are really a lot making a switch to who just is a from a blog post of made last experiences i have are mainly about the dutch but they also might apply to any other i group all software engineers are currently in a market that might look very good for companies are desperately trying to get software engineers now on no matter the if you switch jobs you can demand almost anything you in the netherlands there is a trend now to even give 2 lease cars with a just to get you to work for how weird is how am i gonna drive 2 cars at the same course this sounds very good for but this also creates a very unhealthy you are currently working for a company which is growing fast and you are trying to attract more to finally get some serious software development from the there is to be found without offering sky high trying to find quality is very a lot of people are attracted to our kind of because of the good but this also means that a lot of people without the right passion are entering our i think that is the right when you have passion for your your job stop at you will keep refreshing all of your development rss feeds all you will search the internet for the latest technologies that might be interesting to use at and you will start about a dozen new projects a just to see if you can master that latest technology you just read about a couple of weeks ago find an useful way of actually using that that the market might look very nice of the money and of course the hot girls we but i think it will be that interesting very long fireman or might sound that i am trying to protect my own job here and partly that is but i am also trying to protect myself against the people i want to work i want to have heated discussions about stuff i read i want to be able to spar with people that have the same for the job as i i want colleagues that are working with me for the right are those people i am looking

management experience from other many industries teaches us that is cheaper in the long run than known as and subsequent also learned that the ranges in most cases from 1 to 2 which means that your investment pays off after considering that investments on that scale are usually expected to reach a break even after 4 this is pretty problem is that it took the other industries several decades to accumulate enough data for being able to that this is the case for you can easily find data to support their conclusion and draw a conclusion for software in analogy to but as of there is no proof for the software being i believe that the analogous conclusion is a pair of developers and one tester are more productive than one developer and two you have problems justifying two expensive developers sitting in front of one computer to the there are many other things that help with defect but are not as visible therefore to the

manipulation uses native functions to perform simple browser vendors optimize you are building the row from internally jquery is using to build the collection which then patches into the is slow in comparison because js code needs to loop through the dom newer browsers have native selection handling which provides dramatic speedups to selector based as time moves on this will be less of a is how the query in breaks through every element returned elements within the and test with every element still remaining and collect the final is different for jquery as engine moves through the selector the other way beginning with getting all input elements and then testing the parent that the js selector engines implement a lot more of the css selector spec than is actually usable with css implemented by current exploiting and knowledge of the we can optimize selector can be optimized in a few different you know what element type the is faster for filter first for type and then for the class for only those this apply for a very small subset of but that is almost never the case in single class test is the slowest of the common people actually loop is faster than two this only finds input elements and then directly filters them by type since are never unique may also be skipped smart engines will try to do this because unique is more direct more complex selector may actually be faster if it is more direct move the search context up to the table this i mean that instead of looping through the and searching for the checkbox in every leave them alone until after the loop and then select them all at a point of this is to eliminate the overhead of firing the selector engine up but instead do everything in one this is presented here for completeness rather than something that i think would return massive the row from assigning events as you row cell row cell may be impossible for reasons of ajax or other templates out of your the speed may not be worth turning your code into this sort of but sometimes this may make if none of these work for or return too performance it may be time to rethink the method you can assign an event listener higher up the tree and grab the events instead of you may want a faster if do some stuff way you do anything and the user actually requests

most are traditionally this means you update the present its current state render and the natural representation for this is a win32 message pump on the other hand is a platform specific geared towards the applications that make up the majority of apps on by no means the standard for applications across all platforms so not surprising that not all software fits nicely into the so to amend a typical program to fit the win32 you typically drain that queue in one once per iteration of the using peekmessage until you put that logic into a separate thread and use getmessage as most games with performance in mind there is no other practical way to do if you tried to make the game instead of polled need higher resolution timing than windows can reliably give you if you want to keep the high performance that many games go windows is only one of the platforms that games are written and reworking the game to fit nicely into the win32 model will just be an inconvenience for dedicated game platforms which expect the canonical game loop concerns about are most modern games are designed to be used in fullscreen mode with exclusive hardware not to be just one of several other applications customers of such games actually demand that the game makes the most use of their hardware and this cannot be done if there are deliberate calls or updates are dependent on external timers waking the application n times a obviously there are exceptions for many those that are designed to run primarily in a but important to note the

need to find an algorithm for generating every possible permutation of a binary and need to do so without using lists is because the tree itself carries semantics and restraints that cannot be translated into found an algorithm that works for trees with the height of three or but whenever i get to greater i loose one set of possible permutations per height node carries information about its original so that one node can determine if all possible permutations have been tried for that the node carries information on weather or not been if it has seen all possible permutations of the tree is meaning that the right node should always in some cases that i need to cover for this be a leaf while the left node is always either a leaf or a algorithm using at the moment can be described sort of like the left child node has been swap my right node with the left child nodes right set the left child node as if the current node is back to its original swap my right node with the lowest left right swap the lowest left nodes two set my left node as set my left chilnode to use this as original set this node as return return if the left child has not been if the result of trying to permute left child is return the permutation of this else return the permutation of the left child this node has a left node and a right node that are both swap set this node to be desired behaviour of the algoritm would be something like branch branch 0 branch branch 2 1 0 first branch branch 1 second 2 branch branch 1 0 2 third branch branch 0 fourth swap 1 2 so a binary tree without the use of

not sure what you are build and what is the but as a general rule of thumb i do not consider this a grievous security lets look at the attack in the middle attack on the http text traffic an especially one obfuscated against ocr will prevent this but also simply using https as pornel scraping by a remote desktop application https protection will not nor an image as the mess on a screen has to be read by a human anyway human attacker can also circumvent your obfuscated image protection against in the by instructing the listener to archive the image and then go over them if a human is behind the screen then you have no your shoulder eavesdropping if the attacker is simply standing behind the then again you have no note that if your password is then you must show it to the there is no way around one way sites try to mitigate the threat is to send the password by email under the assumption that a user can make sure they read the email when no one is at their own unfortunately email will not even let you have the benefit of encryption to protect the my the best way is to let the user input the password a password obfuscation like normally it is and then only store the hash of the password so you need not store the actual preventing you from showing it to the if you must show it to the user because you are generating then make sure you are over https and just show it all the fanfare just complicates the implementation without giving any security

of usual concurrent in any using any abstraction is and and has many take into programming complicates any application by critical sections is and sometimes bugs originating in concurrent code is and much dependent on os concurrent has gone a long way in making concurrent programming as easy as possible for for most you will see that has most of the abstractions you will interface and object you can just throw in your code and you have a thread ready to nice set of constant dynamic or just throw a at it and it does the and of all sorts relieve you of needing to implement common locking and api for all only thing left for as the software is to ensure you are writing meaning you should be aware of the dangerous situations you might be exposing yourself a situation in which two or more threads are waiting on unordered rendering an infinite waiting two or more threads which politely try to give way to the other on a shared resource but end up not taking it two people in a corridor walking up to each other and constantly moving together from side to a single thread taking up most or all of a single shared thus depriving other threads from access to point when to threads only when concurrency will directly improve your applications you are waiting on an spawn a thread on it so you can continue doing other you are just trying to elegantly split use you just might end up worsening your you do use make sure you have thoroughly contemplated the and you did not miss any exceptional way to get into things is to do the concurrency other than get a good luck

overloading is pretty essential for a lot of functors would be impossible to create without the ability to overload programming would in many cases become a pain in the if i write a numerical i rely on the value type behaving the same whether a or some i rely on the usual arithmetic operators being and so i have to write a separate overload for and another for custom pointers rely on objects being able to overload the dereferencing operator so that they can behave like overloading is extremely important for making programming for it being i just see no more complicated than creating your own which people generally find fairly if you name it it is a if you name it an but the code in the body is the exact course operators sometimes get and or may be borderline but so commonly known and used that i think asked about operator overloading in something like gladly do without their implementation is much more they work with and they enable all the nice and convenient tricks that	
own answer to this depends mostly on how many different modules be if only going to use one or often use since it makes for fewer keystrokes in the rest of the but if going to make use of many different i prefer just because that means that each module reference is i can see where each symbol comes from without having to hunt i prefer the self documenting style of plain import and only change to import when the number of times i have to type the module name grows above 10 to even if only one module being

pure using an int as your primary key is better simply due to the support for comparison of ints at the machine code strings are compared using algorithms implemented at the database unless your strings are very an integer key will take up less space on the page as well based on the other answer now on the not sure if understood your question are you asking whether it is better to use an integer as your key compared to a string either could be or are you asking whether your type should match your database assuming the would be very surprised if it is the latter whose answer i would think is lieven has now clarified his request to say that he in asking whether an int or an nchar field would be better as an index so my original take on this question was add to my it is almost always better to have an int as your the exception is when there is a key that can be captured as a short character string in an accounting system where entries are char the reasons are integers are represented as a native machine type or and manipulated via operations whereas strings are not but must be compared using a for when traversing the pk index some variant of a to locate a the comparison operation at each node is a single is this a huge probably not unless you are working with a truly massive database or transaction if you have a natural character key by all use if your is the first five letters of the last name plus the first initial plus a number to make it then obviously be far better off with an int integers simply take up less room than almost any char key assuming the use of and it just the room in the main table remember that the index fields are represented in the index as is this a big not unless you working with a massive our choice of keys often has effects for if you use the primary key on one table as the foreign key on both of the above effects are magnified when you are inserting or updating records in the table using the foreign use the key that is most if you have a choice between int and char and both are essentially go with the int over the

question is how does one abstract a database connection from the model layer of an the primary concern is to be able to easily change from different types of maybe you start with a flat then you want to move to a sql then later you decide an ldap implementation would be how can a person easily plan for something like a simple say you have a user with a first last and a very simple php class representing it might look like this ignore the problems with public instance user public public public have frequently seen where people have a dao class which has the sql embedded in it as userdao public public public public public function into user problem with strategies like this is when you want to change your you have to change every dao delete functions to deal with your new type of even if you have a program to them for you i am not particularly a fan you would have to edit this program to make it work are your suggestions for how to handle current idea is to create a super class for dao objects with its own load these functions would take arrays of the attributes of the dao and generate the query in this the only sql is in the superdao class rather than being scattered about several then if you wanted to change your database you would only have to change how the superdao class generates the foreseeable the the and the the best way to abstract the database from a php

question is very closely related to another question asked databases and databases address different not only in scale and but in the structure and usage of the as i understand it is about scalability that the architecture refers to a capability to increase capacity in a scalable the cloud is used frequently in reference to the where someone else takes care of the but an independent issue from the cloud you could operate your own set of servers in a cloud the justification for using the cloud architecture is that you have an application that has a variable need for computing so it would be overkill to have n servers dedicated to match your peak level of the cloud allows you to vary your usage of the servers as your level of activity grows over justification for using a saas model is that you want to be in the business of operating a data willing to relinquish some control and pay for the so that you can leave operation details to the experts in that they handle hardware 24x7 you handle your application and your	
question seems to have been asked but i feel like my situation is slightly have a page that contains a when a button is pressed to edit one of the records in the the button first executes some client script that pops up a modal window for the purposes of editing using from this the user hits update which updates the database and closes the once the window is the code is supposed to which will call the function to refresh the i get the error postback or callback event validation is enabled using configuration or in a security this verifies that arguments to postback callback events originate from server control that rendered if the data is and use method in order to register postback or callback data really irks me is that i use this exact same logic on a different page and it works suggestions as to how i could avoid i have removed the line of code that added the and i still get the so fairly positive it is being caused simply by the upon closer inspection i realize that there are in fact some listitems being programatically bound to i probably need to do the could someone possibly give me an example on what the syntax for doing that would look seems to be set up differently than the scriptmanager postback or callback

question will always boil down to which operator is most or you have an unordered adding to it takes no and accessing particular items takes extra you have a sorted adding to it takes more but accessing it is applications spending most of their time accessing the rather than adding to which means that the time overhead in creating a sorted list will usually be balanced or covered by the time saved in accessing the there is a lot of churn in your data it sound like there then maintaining a sorted list necessarily because you will be constantly resorting the list as considerable cpu complexity of the data structures only matters if they be sorted in a useful if they can be then have to go by the heuristic of of of determine if sorting is a good	
quick and dirty way would be to create a composite key from the two pieces of values new i b key encapsulate this a bit better you could wrap the class private readonly values new public int bool string key return string key private static string bool return make this more encapsulate the composite key as a a class that contains the two ensuring you override the and methods

rather a lot of good literature on implementing malloc and similar but i notice that you include here are you aware that you can write your own implementation of and in that might be useful as a way to do it any the characteristics you want are going to depend pretty heavily on your that on the pattern of usage over if you have only mallocs and new if you have only mallocs of or a few block also other you get some leverage by having the ability to chain memory but c that basic implementation of malloc simply allocates a header that contains the data an use and the malloced malloc then constructs a new header at the end of its allocates the and returns a when you it just resets the in use trick is that when you do a lot of mallooc and you can quickly get a lot of small blobs that in but are hard to so you need some kind of bumpo gc to merge blocks of could do a more complicated but remember that takes you want a free to take up a lot of a paper on solaris malloc implementations you might find another building an alternative again in but the basics are the and you should read the on garbage and follow it to some of the more formal you really should have a look at generational garbage the basic idea is that the longer something remains the more likely is it to this is an extension of the gc you you allocate new stuff in one part of your memory call it when you reach a high water mark on you look through the allocated blocks and copy the ones that are still in use to another section of call it then you can just clear the g0 space and start allocating eventually g1 gets to its high water mark and you fix that by clearing and clean up g1 moving stuff to and when you rename the old g1 as g0 and vice versa and trick is that in c the handles you hand out to memory are straight raw you really move things around without some heap big asks moving stuff around just be a and indeed it but consider this this is not and just for for entertainment no warranty express or basic environment for mymemoryhdl char this will be your memory mallocate some if we get past it succeded your implementation of you create the memory and return a pointer to the char nextunusued partitionsize hwm so g0 will be the bottom half and g1 the top half to start char g0 char g1 void rtn memory completely exhausted return otherwise add header at nextunused includes some pointers for and a field with values used or set to used nextunused headerlen this could be niftier rtn nextunused nextunused size of the things are free set the flag in the using an now you do all the stuff and you get to your high water each block in your memory pool block header is still marked used block into other partition clear the partition go back to the original handle you saved in what does it point you just set it to 0x00 with where the magic comes in c at the pointer you returned from your malloc is no longer under your control you move it around after the in with you can fix

real thing to consider is what your program does with the relational databases are designed to handle complex relationships between sets of not designed to perform complex the amount of data and relative simplicity of it suggests to me that you could simply use a flat file to store the coordinates and read them into memory when this way you can design your data structures to more closely reflect how going to be using this rather than how going to store languages provide a mechanism to write data structures to a file and read them back in again called is one such and sure you can find one for whatever language you just design your classes or data structures as dictated by how used by your program and use one of these serialization libraries to populate the instances of that class or data the requirement that the structures be mutable really affect much with regard to my answer i still think that serialization and deserialization is the best solution to this the fact that users need to be able to modify and save the structures necessitates a bit of planning to ensure that the files are updated completely and but ultimately i think end up spending less time and effort with this approach than trying to marshall sqlite or another embedded database into doing this job for only case in which a database would be better is if you have a system where multiple users are interacting with and updating a central data and for a case like that be looking at a database server like or sql server for both speed and also commented that going to be using as your has support for serialization so you should be to

say functional programming lends itself particularly well to flight in functional languages be very useful for writing scientific though this is a slightly specialised probably be better off with a standard imperative language like as they would tend to have the better physics libraries as well as graphics both of which you would need to use very the oop approach might make it easier to represent your another point to consider is that far as i the popular flight simulators on the market today are written pretty much entirely in my philosophy is that if no particularly good reason that you should need to use functional then use a functional language nothing to stop you using functional constructs in i suspect going to have a lot less painful of a development process using the apis for and languages more commonly associated with game development has many commonalities with flight if you want to add some complex ai to the lisp might seem like a rather more obvious though even then i at all jump for and if really keen on using a functional i would recommend you go with one of the more general purpose ones like python or even mixed languages as opposed to which could end up getting rather ugly for such a

seems to me like the three answers so far have completely missed the point of your or i asking why win32 delphi have something like the magical function that article talks a function given the name of a dll and the type information of an returns an object that implements that interface using the standalone functions exported from the seems to be all about calling code from a win32 not about importing functions from a requires that the dlls export a special function that the manager will call when it loads the and the function must return an instance of the so the dll must be written in delphi or the on the other works with any dll written in any you could use it on if you know why win32 delphi have such a maybe codegear see much demand for it since delphi and turbo pascal had already gone for so long without certainly possible to write a function that works like and i expect it would be any harder to write than the version must have unless libraries already provide most of the pieces and delphi just wraps them up into a function that looks like the several other overloaded versions of that delphi has had for would be a few steps to implementing that function in providing only a sketch of necessary because i have a running copy of delphi handy right ask and maybe find more need to make sure that type information for an interface at a the undecorated names of its would need to generate a function stub for each method in the interface and the stub would go something like assuming the calling convention is pop the return discard the and restore the return pop pop push jmp generated each it would fill in the actual function gotten from calling with the name of the corresponding interface the calling convention is easy to wrap like is a little is a pain in the it has all the stubs it would need to generate an that looks like it implements the given it have to be an actual at compile know the layout of the interface going to be asked to so having a class accomplish final step is to provide implementations of the and would be is where call when the reference count reached do much at except claim that it supports and the interface given to used to come with a sample program that demonstrated implementing an interface without any classes at it was all done with records and function pointers is all an interface ultimately after delphi also came with the corresponding code to do it with in part to show how much easier delphi can make i find the name of the demo program but sure still around

should not be mocking the ientryrepository since the implementing class is the class under you want to mock the and inject then just test that the methods that you invoke via your public interface are called this would just be an alternative to the way you have it implemented and necessarily better unless you want the class to have backing class injected in which case writing the tests that way would force that might want some more tests to make sure that when you insert an the right entry is likewise with delete insert a couple of then delete one and make sure that the proper one has been once you come up with tests to get the code to do what you want it keep thinking of ways that you could mess up writing the code and write tests to make sure those granted this class is pretty simple and you may be able to convince yourself that the tests you have that drive behavior is it take much to make it worth testing edge cases and unexpected	
should point out that you should almost never do allocation while implementing posts about way that works a new array on the means this is really not a good general you would be better using a method call per field and maintaiing the hash state as a variable passed to them makes it easy to use better hashing functions and avalanching

snapshots an audit trail is a common database for many creating or audit tables is an easy and straight forward while database level backups and transaction logs are good to they are not a version control you need create a shadow table with all the same columns as the base and then setup triggers on the base table to place a copy of the row in the shadow table when ever it is updated or some logic you can recreate what the data looked like at a given point in for an easy way to set this up in sybase you need to do lots of historical then you can keep the data in the same create two columns an added and deleted the downside is for every query you must add a where of course you can create a which shows just the active this gets a bit more complicated if you have a normalized database with multiple all with it does you simply have the and columns on each and then your query has the point in time of whenever data is modified you must copy the current and mark it as	
so first the answer to your assuming you have some structure like public class public string the original type type currtype node thisnode string while methodinfo mi if propertyvalue new propertykey if return currtype to its base currtype return public class othernode new public string return says public class testnode implementation of getintrinsicproperty above will do what but i would suggest that forcing a child class to exactly replicate your signature and a developer to understand what you this is what virtual methods are if understanding you correctly the proper way to do what you want is public class public virtual string case return call on return public class othernode public override string switch case return the and i know call on return public class testnode static void node node new var prop1 var prop2 var prop3 node new prop1 prop2 prop3 idea of virtual methods is that the type of your variable determine which implementation is but rather the run time type of the object determines far as i can the situation describing is one where you are trying do your own dispatch to the implementation of a method on the runtime type of the pretty much the definition of a virtual i get the question please

solution makes your system dependent on javascript to a more robust solution is to build something that is at least without and then on load use javascript to modify the behavior of the buttons to do something more requires more code to do it that way and as but if looking for the you may want to weigh in and determine whether handling the is a priority or ever route you you should at least consciously make a decision one way or another instead of letting it surprise you later	
solution requiring no javascript or even you are being automatically redirected to a new if your browser does not redirect you in 10 or you not wish to advantage of this solution over using the header is that you need to pause the script which will appear to the user as if the server is busy or their connection has solution also gives the user the option of proceeding to the new page immediately rather than having to wait number of while their browser displays no i think also worth noting that if you do decide to use the the you need to make sure your duration too i think most browsers generate a timed after not receiving any data from the server for 1

take on this is that model binders should be constructing presentation not entity types from your the model binder should be a very simple mapping from the collection of the form to a presentation model which is mostly scalar values with possibly some relationships to other types that are mostly scalar values or having to materialize entity instances from a repository adds a lot of as you have using a presentation model has a large number of is never a need to whitelist the fields the user is allowed to since the presentation model contains only those default model binder will work for all but the most complex model binding in i find that i only need to use a custom model binder when the value the user sees has to be bound to some other value in a conditional when using a presentation model the structure of your presentation model should match the structure of the so you do not need to use a custom model binder for structural will be able to create your views and controllers before creating a database or entity this means you can get customer on your design before doing a large amount of the work to create the final this helps to sort out structural issues in the entity model before they just create a presentation model which matches the page you think the customer wants to build the general outline of the page using a instance of this presentation and show it to the if you can then build the model and write a linq query to map that to your presentation in your the subcategories would come in from the form collection as a list of the presentation model should have the same list of in the after you can call a method to transfer the model values from the presentation model to a materialized category instance from the

takes a string of 4 hyphen delimited and string of 4 hyphen delimited titles and makes a request for json data to my web then the web service makes a tracker with status and awaits the user to confirm the tracker before json can be served up on next the user confirms the tracker there will be a drop down of the 4 titles to choose the most appropriate upon confirmation the title chosen form the drop down will be passed to an actionresult in the web service that will set the status of the tracker to and add the id associated with the title to the id column of the way i was doing it was having the javascript send in the 4 ids and titles as two separate strings inside the rest request and then adding them in the same format to an one column in the then splitting them just before adding them to the drop down is an digital photographers voices photoshop cs4 classroom 65014838 photoshop cs4 65015634 photoshop cs4 sends to service digital photographers voices photoshop cs4 classroom 65014838 photoshop cs4 65015634 photoshop creates new tracker row in sql photoshop digital photographers voices photoshop cs4 classroom 65014838 photoshop cs4 65015634 0 service then shows a drop down list with all the titles for the user to select is updated to status and the column is cleared and filled with only one id and same with the titles service can use the single id and title the user select to get data from another sql what i want to know is if there is a better way to store the and associated titles instead of delimited in one if this was a really long post way to organise

the algorithm that is the since you probably care about doing this in real generally for smaller blocks of the algorithms compress about the same or take a few mostly because the algorithms need to transmit the dictionary or huffman trees in addition to the highly recommend deflate by zlib and for a number of the algorithm is quite well bsd and is the only compression required to be supported by zip per the infozip aside from the when it determines that the compression is larger than the decompressed a store mode which only adds 5 bytes for every block of data block is 64k aside from the store deflate supports two different types of huffman tables dynamic and a dynamic table means the huffman tree is transmitted as part of the compressed data and is the most flexible varying types of nonrandom the advantage of a fixed table is that the table is known by all decoders and thus need to be contained in the compressed the decompression code is relatively written both java and javascript versions based directly off of zlib and they perform rather other compression algorithms mentioned have their i prefer deflate because of its runtime performance on both the compression step and particularly in decompression point of zip is not a compression it is a for doing packet i would bypass zip and just use the apis provided by

there an easy method of accessing custom configuration data through a interface without requiring each execution context from configuration information which would be computationally like most other classes in library are annotated with the following public static in visual members of this type are thread any instance members are not guaranteed to be thread my reading of the objects returned from the and other similar methods must not be assumed to be and thus should not be used by multiple execution this prohibits storing a in a singleton that would otherwise be because while the access to the section object may be the members on the object itself are not calls to are likely to require of the configuration files and allocating new instances which has a high overhead considering the configuration is not likely to ever change after copying the configuration data into another object that has been made seems to defeat one of the main benefits of using the configuration package in the first place access to and validated configuration information without much boilerplate is there a way to use in a manner without resorting to excess parsing and allocations of configuration does implementing your own free you from the lack of guarantee provided by microsoft even though accessing it through the interfaces if how would you implement it to be when access to the base indexer is required for accessing the configured safe usage of

there is a especially in java or other oo basic is that your command parser is a finite state the start state is an empty line index at the start of a think about echo foo bat the line into a the grammar is usually noun noun so interpret it that you can do it with a sequence of if but a hash is you load the hash with strings as and index something it could be just a which would go into a is hashtable cmds new enum cmdindx get the token into switch case process get each successor token and copy it to recognize the process you can apply the command and object factory now you have a class public interface command public void public command public class echo implements command public void the code is foreach noun in echo public command this clones the object and returns your code load the hashtable cmds new new one for each token is in the or are in a how this you look up the object in the you call the method to get a new you then invoke the processing for that command using the may be a bit in that it uses the factory why have a factory use that so that each time you execute a the object the instance of can have its own internal if you need state to persist for a long you can simplify this to it simply gets and uses the object you created when you instanciated it with new

this question is getting quite if this is the first time reading this i suggest you start near the bottom as the solution is there in a round about but the code is a bit reading a on i was able to change my existing class to support generic many objects are already dependent on so looking for a way of making a method generic rather than the entire tried the but it looks like this behavior want the entire class to be t foobar2 public return fb2 this supposed to not or is it a bug elsewhere that getting confused reference to put this in to some sort of perspective as to what i want to how do it in class public t where t return class foobar2 foobar1 fb1 new fb2 there any way i can do something similar to that in corrected some minor syntax details meant to make foo and return not still getting compiler when i remove the template behavior the error goes the answer so far say what doing is but if it is then why am i getting the error thanks for your the actual source code what i think is anwyay let me know if you think skipped an important imagematrix public various functions t imagefilter public various functions create a new instance of imagematrix and return filter2 the actual compiler undefined reference to the everything but the implementation line is located in a so being called from a separate does this its all in the same all blocks are different files i comment out the implementation line filter2 it builds so it seems to be this line thats causing 5 having could this be a problem with the scratch grasped the concept of templates the template definition must be in the header along with the declaration so now that moved the declaration in to everything had to use to get it is this if way off please correct this is in the header this looks really really imagematrix image imagematrix return to update when i use imagematrix image imagematrix return i get this error in member function t instantiated from conversion from to type error if i use all of that smelly code in update imagematrix public t imagematrix return i get the same error as in update support individual generic methods rather than generic

use the term smoke test to refer to a testing that does quick basic tests to an application or product to make it qualify for further testing like integration testing or functionality it is of little use to do integration testing or other adavanced testing if the application fails to do some of the elementary things required for these advanced for instance we have a web based application and we do smoke test to ensure we can load all the web lets users to these are the basic things that should work with the application to make it if the pages do not even load or if the users could not even we cannot do much with functionality or integration we do smoke testing with every build followed by functionality and integration

what you get if you use or or does not correspond to what is stored internally in the it is a object which overloads the way php interates its get the true representation of the element with something like iterates over a simplexml element or you access its properties using the you get a munged version of the this munged version allows you to do things like or as if it really had these as but is separate to the true xml contained in the munged representation elements are not necessarily in and elements whose names are php reserved words presented as but can be accessed with code like as if the object is an associative where multiple sibling elements have the same name they are presented like i guess an empty string is also presented like an array for some when output using you get the real

when my rails app encounters an error it dumps the error code and stack trace onto the browser do i turn this off so that these error are only recorded in the log and not outputted to the i am mostly concerned with only the validation all i want is the same functionality you get when using generated i would like to show the validation error messages and highlight the offending form right now all i get is this standard development error originally this was working on my app but somehow it was validation error	
when the profiler is going to modify your code with additional instructions to gather and track the necessary performance never want to distribute an instrumented version of your and you want to use instrumented assemblies for debugging purposes critical sections race conditions etc could certainly behave differently given the additional being instrumentation can be very valuable for the goals profiling is meant to by gathering actual data and isolating expensive optimization efforts can be focused appropriately and the results can be measured accurately avoiding wasted increased reduced and all the other problems associated with premature

whole heartily join the recommendation to manually change the crt version you link if for some reason i cannot this is the right course of action for the way to do so is change the for your make sure a manifest is generated on every build configuration as it would overwrite your manual also make sure there that isolation is locate the manifest file should be at the you should see a section similar to debug of you need to edit the version and publickeytoken attributes of the crt can inspect the files at your local folder to see the versions check how to extract the publickeytoken once you find the version you first try and look directly into manifests of other linking against your desired crt you do go expect some rough you may have some luck if your application is a console app that does not link against other components if your application is be surprised if there some intricate version dependencies amont the sxs also need to distribute with your application the specific crt who did

why that called the stack to trigger is telling you what to acquire your resource in a i would one one utsttc is just one application of raii is much management resource is anything that needs cleanup after studies of projects across many platforms show the majority of bugs are related to resource management and particularly bad on windows to the many types of objects and resource management is particularly complicated due to the combination of exceptions and for a peek under the see guarantees that the destructor is called and only the constructor relying on raii can solve many nasty problems the average programmer might not even be aware here are a few examples beyond the local variables will be destroyed whenever i us start with an overly simplistic class employing explicit file if throw the only reason we are checking the file pointer for is because it might have been moved it is not needed to check against a failed because the destructor is never executed when the constructor if the following technicalities can be skipped on the first they are not crucial to understanding the basic idea of if you plan to implement your own raii it is absolutely essential that you read on it does not make sense to copy a file hence we disallow the otherwise implicitly generated copy the following operations enable transfer of and require compiler support for rvalue a a resource is from one object to file file return construction fails an no other member function not even the destructor gets avoids using objects in an invalid it already makes life easier before we even use the let us have a look at temporary filehandle are three error cases to no file can be only one file can be both files can be opened but copying the files in a would have to handle all three cases releases resources that were even when multiple resources are acquired within one let us aggregate some filehandle this logger can write to two files at const if throw constructor of will fail if constructor fails could not be constructor fails could not be or writing to the files inside constructor body in any of these destructor will be called so we cannot rely on destructor to release the but if was its destructor will be called during cleanup of the simplifies cleanup after partial all problems can be solved with raii and smart pointers is sometimes unwieldy when you need delayed pushing aggregated objects onto the the logger needs a in that the that still needs to be a member of needs to reside on the heap in a smart to trigger the destruction have never wished for garbage collection when i do i sometimes feel a moment of bliss that i just do not need to but much more i miss all the cool toys that can be created through deterministic just does not cut have had one particularly complex structure that might have benefited from where smart pointers would cause circular references over multiple we muddled through by carefully balancing strong and weak but anytime we want to change we have to study a big relationship gc might have been but some of the components held resources that should be release note on the filehandle it was not intended to be just a sample but turned out thanks johannes schaub for pointing out and fredoverflow for turning it into a correct over settled with the approach

work primarily as a c because the application is with a fairly long history originally developed in the early the application suite originally was developed for unix based graphical my previous job was a similar a mature distributed application that was developed on multiple unix originally in the early and due to the source code size and it would be difficult to justify simply throwing that code base away to move to a new development language or even migrating to would imagine there are still a number of larger for internal not sold as a applications written in c that are still being not entirely unlike the massive cobol applications that large companies that are also still being development in others have already mentioned the embedded systems where the development is often for software put into rom or flash memory where it is referred to as for atmel where object code ram and performance matters so the usage of a programming language with fewer or generic abstractions or assumptions is critical thing about good to great c is that they are expected if not required to know more about data structures and priority binary and should be at least vaguely this is because the c language lacks the and other standard libraries available in other this is at least partly because most implementations are to lack of templates or dynamic typing or similar to have generic enough routines to be useful in more than one programming language is not a bad even if you feel comfortable enough to claim to be comptent enough to program in the additional langages a scripting or web development language might be a good and ruby are good potential programming functional languages like objective and scala are good candidates for making you admittedly prolog is actually a declarative logic programming but it is still programming experience

workflow sounds reasonable to got alice and bob each with their own repos on and each presumably pulling down from there to a localmachine to develop when they finish something they want to they can just push it to their repo on where visible to the other one thing i think you left out is repo owned by quinn in when alice bob decide something is production they push over to quinn then takes that and runs it through his rigorous set of tests and such and eventually if it passes he pushes out a new quinn could be some kind of continuous integration robot like hudson or cruisecontrol or somesuch that does the autobuild and testing this be it owned by quinn or a is also likely the place that alice and bob sync their repos with pulls the set of code that everyone develops workflow you outlined is as far as it i hope this answer	
working a site where users could technically stay logged in as long as they never close their browser therefore never get a new session what i could see a user leaves a browser open on computer the then use computer login and change their name which is stored in the they logout of but a is still logged in and still has their old name stored in the their name be updated till the next time they logout manually or they close their browser and open it again and are logged in through the remember me is a simple but in my case the subscription level of their account is stored in the session and can be do you deal with few ideas that i have a period of 10 minutes or the session data it might be exactly 10 minutes if the user is highly active as the function will get triggered right at the 10 minute point or it could be after 2 hours if the user leaves and comes back and then triggers the as little information as possible in the session and load the rest from the db on every page really like this database sessions and use the same session on all the i like but i could see it getting confusing when something like search criteria are stored in the same criteria would show up on both even such as the name or store it in the but for other information that would heavily affect their abilities on the store it in the session and load when needed to only do it once per there other better use database session and when an update is made load the other sessions change the relevant information and save them back to the is the best way to deal with sessions when the user may stay logged but a session key needs to be because of another

would say do not initialize them it will be abundantly clear what is happening without would also say to not initialize local variables until you having a meaningful value for i often see code that resembles the following void someobject myobj if myobj else if myobj myobj null assignment is but i actually feel that it is damaging as if we forgot to assign to myobj in one of the code if we assigned to yourobj rather my myobj in the then we would end up with myobj set to null which would ultimately manifest as a null reference exception at some later point during without the inital null assignment then this would be a compile error much easier to deal

you are creating destroying tables programmatically during the normal operation of your i would say this is a very bad sign that something in the database design is systems can and do handle tables with that many to make any meaningful sorts of queries on that number of you really do have to choose your indexes carefully and i you really have to know intimately how the table will be i dare say it would be a good deal less complicated to implement than the approach you proposed of creating new tables arbitrarily based on ids or numbers with less complication comes greater ease of and less chance that introduce nasty bugs that are hard to you are really keen on splitting into multiple then i suggest that you look into how other people do rather than creating tables create a fixed number of tables from the based on how many you think you are likely to and allocate records to those tables based not on some arbitrary thing like how many records are in the tables at the but on something predictable the zip code is an example or the category the document is or the domain name or country of the user who created or something logical that you can use to easily determine where a record ended up and it will be reasonably spread of the benefits of data partitioning this where you create all the partitions to start is that if you need to in future relatively easy to move to multiple database if you are creating and destroying tables going to make that less

you catching exceptions that you want to then filter more so you can then change your decide not to handle them and so rethrow you want to be really careful about not really a good better to never catch the exception in the first the reason is that a given handler should not take the decision to run nested blocks for exceptions that it is not expecting to for if there is a probably a very bad idea to continue executing any code as it will probably cause another such exception to be and blocks are just like any other as soon as an exception is caught for the first any blocks on the stack beneath the will be by which time too late another exception may be and this means that the original exception is implies that you have to careful write out a separate handler for all the exception types you want to it also implies that you can only filter by exception this is sometimes very hard advice to should be possible to filter exceptions in other but in it is it is possible in and the bcl itself takes advantage of this by having a small amount of code written in so it can filter exceptions in a more convenient a detailed with a code from the clr team my two

you have an internal data structure that you want to prevent simultaneous access to by multiple you should always make sure the object locking on is not reasoning behind this is that a public object can be locked by and thus you can create deadlocks because not in total control of the locking means that locking on is not an since anyone can lock on that you should not lock on something you expose to the outside means that the best solution is to use an internal and thus the tip is to just use data structures is something you really need to have full control otherwise you risk setting up a scenario for which can be very problematic to

you should lock before setting the private this will be reflected in both threads the same you may want to take some time to consider how to handle the locks and your factory is creating the object and adding it to the it will need a lock of some form around the routine to create the possible that the two threads could ask for the object at the same before it was and create 2 i recommend setting the private member directly it would be a good idea to have a single object inside of the returned class instance used just for and use some form of accessor or that locks on that synchronization object and then sets the for not that its two instances you can always just do something to check in the add a check for reference or even temporarily add a guid to your class setup at construction easy to verify that the same that	
you should mention that been doing that managed to do it using a which uses to keep a copy of the original just copies the stream during and adds the header during the header is a case of reading the contents of the stream from into an xml document in my adding the and then writing it to the original stream passed into this is pretty and you far as use a new instance with appropriate authentication information when you need got of the way using a adding an appropriate attribute to each method of the web service and also an appropriate with an instance of the required header but the soap serialization is currently giving me headaches in terms of specifying the right element names something been planning to ask others about when i get the not to be able to give you a full answer and also apologies for the lack of it belonging to the company rather than me but hopefully at least give you a starting	
you specified assume you are on a unix variant using the switch along with the command line utility tail can allow you to constantly monitor the end of a you could also use something like which can monitor file changes or dnotify place the file in own which usually comes standard on most distributions can then call tail 1 to get the last once the line you can grab the current system time since epoch using and subtract it from the time of the last then plot this difference using i assume you could categorize the ranges to make the graphing easier on 1 bar for less than 1 hour change another for changes between 1 5 and so is a python implementation of tail located if you want to use it upon a detection of a change in the you could perform the	
you sure that the problem is with and not the driver for the i would try another test to validate the up to your problem memory in same way that causes problem in memory usage and it does not then there is a bug in particular to if it happens you would at least know that it has nothing to do with the problem might be in either the com port code or in the driver you are i find it likelier that it the problem might be in the but love to know if there is some unknown issue with serial used before while ports without any such thing you can try to is debug into the there are plenty of other so questions on this so it should be easy to find the method to do that should let you debug down a bit further and see exactly at which point in the memory leak warning since it is a wrapper to the serial you might quickly see it go to world and will probably not get to see to

you thought about the fact that is over 2 need 16gb of memory to store the a 64 bit let alone the objects half that on a 32bit though squeezing 8gb of pointer data into the maximum of 3gb or so usable space would be a good strongly suspect that your problem is not the number of but that the serialization framework is going into some kind of infinite loop because you have referential loops in your data this simple class public string name public children public node parent simple class be because the presence of the parent property means that serialisation will go into an infinite already implementing you are of the way to solving this you just need to ensure you remove any cycles from the object graph you are to store an object technique that is often used is to store the of a referenced object instead of the actual resolving the name back to the object on

you using a validation summary on your some javascript to automatically scroll to the top of the which may well override the automatic behaviour of the client side validation to focus the last invalid have you turned client side validation you take a look at the javascript generated by the client side validation you should see methods like if if if null the call to which is a rather long method that attempts to set the focus to the control in or if you have multiple to the last control that was using the following get this behaviour to you would ideally need to ensure that all your validators are set to be server side validators will obviously require a and that might affect things lose and setting maintainscrollpositiononpostback to true would probably cause the page to reload to the submit rather than the invalid form the server side method will cause to render out some javascript the page near the bottom of the but this could be being overriden by one of the other mechanisms dicussed

you want to develop an air you must use the air if you want to develop a flex application that runs on you need to use believe joshtnjala to be partially but i wanted to add on if using the flex you no longer require the air sdk as those tools are available to the flex it is important to because i see a lot of confusion or misuse of the flex is actually three sdk developers without the flash flex to develop and actionscript3 and mxml code to flash content for one could use flashdevelop for an and compile the code using the flex adobe flex is a open source framework for building highly expressive web applications that deploy consistently on all major and operating it provides a language and programming model that supports common design a declarative is used to describe ui layout and and a powerful programming is used to create client flex also includes a rich component library with more than 100 extensible ui components for creating rich internet applications as well as an interactive flex application builder builder is merely an ide to assist in the development of flash or air this builder utilizes the sdk above to the framework may or may not be used depending on the developers many developers have taken themselves out of the flash ide nasty and began scripting their as3 purely in the flex builder ide as it provides many useful features for the not to mention its a very clean ui and is built on eclipse so it has many plugins and a solid community behind its being to expand on what joshtnala the difference between using the air skd and the flex is that if you merely want to build an air composed of actiosncript3 the air sdk is all you need if you intend to use mxml and any part of the then you must use the flex sdk this will allow you to use the many available components such as in your air so in the both will develop an air application as flex sdk incorporates the air development abstract your project figure out what you will if a component works for or if a custom implementation is then choose your this

you want to have only one insert in your trigger to avoid have a single insert statement insert into hist name values when deleting i want to use not not have a seperate insert statement for a wide not like there no replace in text not going to write the insert just replace with does have a solution but i seriously doubt that performs better than 2 inserts would the big main thing trying to avoid is having to managed 2 inserts when the table matthew battle this attitude all the those who write java or or have a do this is do they write code according to these rules and the problem is when these rules are applied to databases behave the same way code the code having essentially the same code in two is we avoid one would abstract that code to a function and call it from the two places and thus avoid maintaining it and possibly missing we all know the this while that in the end i recommend two they are separated by an you change one and forget the other right not in a different or in some compiled or even somewhere else in the same right beside each an else and the insert is repeated with instead of why am i so crazed about does it really make a difference i know two inserts be worse than other and it could be real reason is being prepared for the times when it does if avoiding two inserts just for the sake of going to miss the times when this makes a huge into from mytable flag column omitted for into from mytable flag including would say this is bad there are two i could easily replace and with a bind variable and flip it at and what most people would but if true is of the values and is you want two because you want two execution one is better off with an index and the other an you do have two inserts to not always bad and in this case good and

you were using oracle then advise benchmarking three table with primary key table hash represents a very vanilla approach really the lowest common but could mean logical reads to get each with one of those being a probable physical read of the table if it is not completely will save you one of those logical read by avoiding the probe to a separate table but might not save you the physical read because the iot segment will be larger and harder to cache than the index will potentially get you the row with a single logical but unless you have the entire table cached probably going to translate into a physical is highly

you wish to use a style where a variable will be left to fall into the bit then a reasonable alternative is of course the default junk variable for getting overwritten often in the course of a i do like the new trick that matlab now using a to designate an ignored return this is a problem for backwards in that users of older releases will be unable to use your i generally avoid using new things like that until at least a few matlab releases have been issued to ensure there will be very few users left in the for even now i find people are still using an old enough matlab release that they cannot use anonymous

your add this before any other js function return if is coded as a function so that less likely accidentally overwrite it with other as of rails the auth token is embedded as a which you can read function return your main you can then call and return your authenticity token as a string to include in your ajax for using that if you use it automatically adds the authenticity token in a hidden if you want to send all of the including the hidden auth you can simply or overridden by hidden input includes hidden and pattern is often useful when already written a form that works without and adding an unobtrusive layer of js that simply sends the data via	
your application internal or do you have an external if a client is paying for your work on and support of the it may be difficult to get them to sign off on cards like the ones you with your second card it might be hard to say what specific approach to your issue could be defect driven testing the idea is that when you get a bug report and estimate the card that says to fix see what you can add in at the same time that are similar but increase you specifically ask for technical details about how to get your project under but this book is very helpful once you start actually doing effectively with legacy

your first you could report the number of operations that succeeded provided the functions return some you could also keep a counter increases after every call in that to note what all calls succeeded and based on that counter return an appropriate error major problem with validating each and every step in a system you are probably introducing too much your second option looks like the only if you have to write a wrapper for every library function and why not add the validation if you instead of making the actual call to the said this is more

your versions are correct except your remarks about the check for in version 1 and the reduced performance in version 3 are cause of the reduced is the way is particularly that it causes a write on every this is because a write though it actually change the data of or intention to cause its cache line to be invalidated on other which means that when another cpu waiting for the same tests it cannot read the data from its but has to get the data from the cpu that previously owned this phenomenon is called cache after the resemblance with the where the ball this case the constantly moves between the players if you add the extra test before the cpus will all just which means they can all have the data in their caches until somebody writes to happens in versions 1 and because they run on every iteration of the that the remarks about the extra check protecting against other thread incorrectly freeing it are not because the other thread must not do but because such a check guard against this even imagine that the other thread does but just after the locking thread does the if you really want to protect yourself against this kind of you should add another variable holding the thread id holding the and checking the correct manipulation with the lock with issue is that on some you need memory barriers to ensure good memory particularly ensuring that the test actually reads the value every time compiler barrier should be sufficient and that any read maybe write if you that occurs inside the critical section that performed by the cpu before the actual lock is unlock has to be handled note that jon version is correct in this because he uses java not but their semantics should be
