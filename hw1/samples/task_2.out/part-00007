2 i just have to assume the integer indexes in the iterations is not a complete solution but i get pass this i could only determine if a 0 is an original 0 or a 1 that was converted to a 0 then i have to use and this would output is like 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 originality of my approach is using the first half of the examination of a row or column to determine if it contains a 0 and the last half to set the values this is done by looking at x and and then y and in each based on the results of the first half of the if a 0 in the row or column was i use the last half of the iteration to change the to just realized this could be done with only 1 boolean leaving 1 to posting this hoping someone might just do i spent way too much time on it not to the code in as integer b2 as y as integer 0 to b1 true b2 for x as integer 0 to scan row for at x and width x halfway through konw if a 0 in this a 0 is found set my first boolean to if x if 0 or 0 then b1 end the boolean is false then a 0 in this row was spend the last half of this the this is where if i change a 1 to a 0 it will cause the to so for now i change to a if there was a way to change to 0 yet later tell value had changed this would if not b1 if x if 1 then if 1 then end end 2 block do the same as the first 2 blocks but i switch x and y to do the if x if 0 or 0 then b2 end if not b2 if x if 1 then if 1 then end end

a novice at so hopefully someone can spell this out for i tried following the multiple strings in sql but i got trying to do the same thing as the originator of the above posting but with a different table and different say that the following field in table has three records table actually has thousands of shiptoplant plant plant 2 what trying to type in the sql case when shiptoplant in then shiptoplant end from keep getting the message error in query expression when shiptoplant in then else shiptoplant want to do this operation for every character on the with exception of since it is a help you could provide would be greatly background information added from the have collected data from each our 14 suppliers for the 2008 calendar i am trying to normalize the plant names that are given to us by our supplier can call a plant by a different name on our master list could be called by service trying to strip chars so that i can try to identify the plant using our master listing by creating a series of links that look at the first 10 if no 8 basic is that i know how to strip the alphanumeric characters from the be doing this operation on several but i planned on creating separate queries to edit the other i need to do a mass update query that strips all the still unclear on how to write what i started out with to take out all the it worked but failed when i tried to nest the replace btst set shiptoplant further information taken from up to 100 new permutations of our plant names appear in our line item invoice this could represent thousands of invoice trying to construct a quick and dirty way to assign a of the definitive name to each plant name the best way i can see to do so is to look at the city and state but the problem with this is that these fields have various permutations as for brookview brookview taking out alphanumerics and doing by changing the number of characters until a match is found between the invoice data and the master plant listing tables contain the city and state you can eventually find a of when you start dwindling down the number of characters you are the accuracy becomes done this in excel and had decent can anyone recommend a better to replace multiple characters in access

a question of memory optimization and loading if you put all your views in one then when your application it has to load the entire xib into memory and construct all of the objects for all of the and this takes a amount of instead you separate your views into separate then your app will start up much because only the xib containing the initial view will be and it will also use less memory at when the view you can load the xib containing the new view this will incur a minor hitch when opening a view for the first if trying to optimize memory you can also unload the previous view when switching but i recommend as this will incur a hitch every time you switch instead of just the first time you switch to any given

all about hamming distance between two values is the number of bits at which they so if you transmit but i receive then the number of bits which must have been switched in transmission is the hamming distance between a and codes are useful when the bits in each code word are transmitted somehow we care whether serial or but they for instance combined into an analogue value representing several or after each bit is independently random with some fixed either received or assuming the transmission is fairly most bits are received so errors in a small number of bits are more and simultaneous errors in large numbers of bits are a hamming code usually aims to correct to detect errors the wikipedia article for details of the two main codes which bigger errors can be but afaik used as code works by evenly spacing out the code points in which in mathematical terms is the metric space consisting of all values of the relevant word with hamming distance as the imagine that each code point is surrounded by a little of invalid if a value is received that a code then an error must have because only valid code points are ever a value in the buffer zone is then the assumption that a error the value which was transmitted must be distance 1 from the value but because the code points are spread there is only one code point that so to that code on grounds that a error is more likely than the greater error that would be needed for any other code point to produce the value in probability the conditional probability that you sent the nearby code point is greater than the conditional probability that you send any other code given that i received the value i so i guess that you sent the nearby with a certain confidence based on the reliability of the transmission and the number of bits in each an invalid value is received which is equidistant from two code then i say that one is more likely to be the true value than the so i detect the but i correct errors are not corrected by a secded hamming the received value is further from the value you actually than it is to some other code and i erroneously it to the wrong so you either need transmission reliable enough that you care about or else you need error detection as well a crc over an entire

am working on a system that requires interaction with a native c api using now stumbled upon a problem which i cannot seem to solve in any the original function is designed to return 2 kinds of based on a parameter that specifies which structure to c header file defines the structures and function as struct dword dword handle far struct bool bool far struct dword dword systemtime far iceapi lpcardidtype iceapi dword lpbyte dword lpdword pcbneeded have attempted to implement wrappers like class cardidtype public uint32 public uint32 public intptr class public bool public bool class public uint32 public uint32 public charset callingconvention setlasterror static extern bool charset callingconvention setlasterror static extern bool uint32 uint32 out uint32 the seems to work i get plausible data in cardidtype instance after calling however when i call the problems the type of structure that should be returned is defined by the and a value of 1 should result in a structure to be returnes in documentation contains the following c success equivalent implementation is like bytearray new out success i execute this the method returns false and return does not make much sense to i see no reason why this call should and definitely not with this error so i suspect i have got something wrong in my know that using as the type of pdata is probably not but according to some googling a translates to i guess the correct way to do this is to have pdata as an and create the structure using i have tried but the result is the here is the code for this charset entrypoint callingconvention setlasterror static extern bool uint32 intptr uint32 out uint32 memsize memptr out int lasterror error code is info thing i forgot to mention is that for some reason the getcardstatus call fails with an unknown entry point exception if i do not specify entrypoint this has not happened to any other function i have so it got me wondering a function call

another way of writing it which may address concerns about accessing the second table more times than when then 1 else 2 when then 3 else 4 example uses an obviously simplified so this version looks kind of silly no reason to join with dual at but in your real query you presumably have a subquery like b from othertable where so you would want to use the actual column names instead of numeric literals and the actual table name instead of and move the subquery conditions into the final where	
answer applies if using sql server management studio for sql the the button has a small button at its this and select with select ansi to get a character	
answer is i would move the cache object so it need to be built every and design your cache so that it raises keyerror when there is a cache def def key res except res return return return	
answer is spot additionally try to use the more modern ansi join syntax to take the load off the where clause so relieve the confusion programs t on d on match against in boolean and match against in boolean and will stop the inadvertant causing a combinatorial expect it to operate in reasonable time unless the database was really can you post the results of an explain select of the presumably one or both of the fulltext indexes is not being i could certainly imagine the query optimiser failing to use the second fulltext by doing something like trying to the rows that match the first fulltext query instead of going straight to the or when you want to fulltext index over two columns in you create one index over both this would in any case be much however it would mean you have to put titles and descriptions in the same this may not be such a since fulltext only works on myisam tables you typically want your canonical data in myisam you can keep the definitive copy of your data in properly normalised innodb with an additional myisam table containing only stripped and stemmed none of that is any i guess go back to the unioning you coupled with an filter to remove duplicate

answer the specific i think there is any way to set up a transaction in the database sense that will do what you think about it and see no guarantee that the various parts of your operation will be handled by the same or quite likely even the same if the request spans database as it will in this the uncommitted parts from one connection will be invisible to the other well as the ideas already consider using one or more tables to hold the incomplete data already then when the user is a single transaction can apply the data to the permanent tables and remove the staging incomplete data can be cleared out on an age criterion by a background process once confident the session has been or held until the user should that better meet your lean towards this approach particularly if i expected to have regular incomplete because this way i have to deal with incomplete data in my main

application by itself with default priority cannot make a system however kernel can and an application do much without calling the kernel has many mechanisms that take precedence over regular running those these have the highest say if you have a device with problem the system will become these come second in the dpcs are basically deferred interrupt processing when a dpc is running multitasking is esentially disabled scheduler itself is a dpc if you have a designed device driver queuing too many dpcs the system may become these are like dpcs but run in a certain thread they are mostly used to copy results to process passive level code cannot run before apcs are is windows cache which works on a separate higher priority thread to write changes in a file to acting as a lazy write this thread takes precedence over regular threads and long running flush operations can hinder system on pagefile volume causes paging operations to be delayed for multiple even if on a different partition have the this can slow down anything on the try the same app on a different disk to see the these mechanisms are involved in a single file so depending on the storage device driver you filter drivers you have installed on the you might end up with an this is usually not the case with device say your is running on a different disk than the then i would recommend starting with perfmon to understand going drill down to sub categories memory manager to understand taking the most process explorer also helps to see dpc and interrupt execution if anything around you might have a buggy otherwise there may be a filter driver interfering with

are a few big benefits to using a framework over sure very proud of the fact that slung enough js to be able to write animations from you should abstracting common functionality away from yourself is actually very you just call the method and know the innards will be and executed even if very fast at writing the stuff still time spent on that instead of solving using a common framework is like speaking a common you can collaborate with other developers very and each can pick up where others left off without to stepping into an application which uses a homegrown library for the things jquery can the people working on jquery are javascript i am really good at and you probably are but a big difference between normal good and jquery a team of insanely good people are constantly poring over a small set of common functionality tuning tweaking enhancing it to make it the best it can possibly that represents a huge number of a single person like you or me simply cannot no matter how good we and if you as good as the jquery you can only benefit by combining your talent with theirs and contributing to the jquery a melting pot of insane

are a few different ways to track is to link the advertisement any to a redirection you would normally pass it some sort of id so it knows which url it should forward but before redirecting the user to that page it can first record that click in a database where it can store the users browser it will then forward the user them really to the specified redirection script landing way to do it is to use pixel this is where you put a or a piece of javascript code onto the body of a the pixel is just an image a script posing as an which will then be requested by the user visiting the the tracker which hosts the pixel can record the relevant information by that image some systems will use javascript instead of an image they use to track this may allow them to gain slightly more information using landing page user requests pixel is an example of a threw in the png at the end because some systems might require a valid image you do not want the user to know what the tracker is you can put code on your landing page to pass data to your this would be done on the backend so it is invisible to the essentially you can just the tracker url while passing relevant data via the get the tracker would then record that data with very limited server load on the landing landing page requests tracker url and concurrently renders

are not at least they many developers talked to seem to find my view of web standards slightly but stay with me you try to create the standard before the you have several long delay before useful implementations nobody has a working implementation to and since nobody is using any of the features it exist there is little impetus to actually implement a type of potential for standards that cannot actually be who knows for sure until somebody actually tries the hla standard was a good example of this to the point where the dod had to write an memo that attempted to set the de facto standard by glossing over some of the errors in the actual potential for standards that serve any practical do people actually want see example at which has fallen into a i think of anybody met who found the css does not including box model to be inability for implementers of the standard to distinguish their products from their resulting in a stubborn desire to break with the standard in practical or see example at think that the w3c learned this the hard way in recent some of the most visible innovation has come from a new browser examples would be html5 canvas xmlhttprequest outlook web access input range rss and the video element came from the proprietary level on not from the standards tower on and these new were forged by looking at these past individual implementations copied microsoft largely for and so not by some think tank pondering the the netscape plugin and sql are all examples of where breaking changes are done gradually in a standard should be a least common denominator that smooths over the basic differences in a pidgin language that works across all of and not an enumeration of robert prescriptive rules about a language or because then you end up with rules that always make sense or apply a ideal trying to apply grammar rules to a like trying to apply grammar rules to an oh this is what the greatest defect in the css standard at this point is that there really a good way to specify that a page was written against a particular version of the we can specify doctypes for our html why i indicate that a document was written for css this will only become more important as we start adding more and more bizarre features to css that affect the actual content of the such as a future version of the standard is going to have errors one day that potentially break and be nice to let the document author ask for certain behavior rather than have browsers attempt to figure out the the lighter now that ie8 and ie7 are things really as bad as they were a specific ie6 stylesheet served with conditional comments can really go a long way to making a implementation the other advice is to to take the fluid layout and hope that someone else has done most of the troubleshooting for a compatible web site is standard or no you can make it easier on yourself if you accept that there will be some differences in the way different browsers render your be afraid of proprietary extensions by any means all right to have css3 rounded corners for your but have a for when they exist the rounded corners critical for using the and let your users choose how like to consume your

are right in your examination and as far as i can tell there is really no direct solution to the problem the reasons lies in the nature of inheritance among which has only a vague resemblance of inheritance among inherited interfaces is a brand new that has some methods in common with the interface it inherits but no direct so by choosing not to implement the base class you are making a specific assumption that the compiled program will timplementation does not implement think is somewhat of a interface extension makes more a common practice is to have a base class implementing the base and than derived classes implementing the extended but in case you want a separate class that implements both simply list those it there a specific reason you want to avoid just you like should even hard type cast an when you do on an interface it will adjust the object vtable pointers in the right if you do a hard cast have methods to you code can easily my impression is that you are treating interfaces like objects inheritance and casts in the same while their internal working is really

are the best practices for exceptions over remote sure that you need to handle all exceptions at the level of a remote method because you need to log it on the server but what should you do you wrap the exception in a remoteexception and throw it to the this would mean that the client would have to import all exceptions that could be would it be better to throw a new custom exception with fewer because the client need to know all the details of what went what should you log on the even heard of using return efficiency to tell the caller about what important thing to keep in is that the client be informed of what went a generic answer of or no notification at all is and what about runtime over remote

better solution would be to use one or more object to store your points geometry can be drawn with a so you could indeed change the stroke thickness when you but more flexible is to use the transform the you can the actual coordinates of the geometric representation and not the visualization so when you draw you need to fiddle with render compute the i use the following code static matrix rect bool matrix translatethenscale first translate to origin since just we scale the graph to the appropriate we flip the graph vertically around the viewport middle since in our graph positive is not if we push the graph to the right which will usually simply be return the fromposition rect should contain the untransformed and the toposition rect should contain the transformed this also trivially allows for scaling x and y which is often necessary for easy to compute the bounds of your bounds are modified by the so we want no graphbounds set the transform if the transform is the following graphboundsalt of course wpf can tell you which bounds you need to render should that be putting it you could do something void bool rect graphbounds matrix transmat new advantage of using this solution is that you need to mess with free to use transforms that shear scale x and y independently without getting weird distortions in your and you can treat the pen as an opaque object easier to customize from the ui if you select pen width or no further correction is	
between each benchmark i think the best approach would be just to load up a table with lots of perhaps a fake table like this table testtable integer primary testdata once loaded it up with a few gigs of test data increasing have your program query randomly and use that for your should eliminate most caching related and give you a good picture of whether there really is a significant different in performance between the various blob retrieval

currently working on two social networking sites that have a lot in yet are distinctively i find myself writing a lot of the same code for both and was wondering if there is a best practice that will limit duplicating of the main problems is that these projects are very independent of eachother and will likely have more differences than similaries once the initial work is they might be handed off to other so having shared code libraries might end up being a big suggestions from people that might have had to deal with a similiar the only developer on both of these and it looks like going to stay that way for a functionality amongst multiple

depends on the character encoding you are in character or a single byte inside a character can never be mistaken for another then as long as the string you are searching in and the string you are using to search are in the same encoding then you can continue to use the regular string search you are using a encoding other than which does not prevent single bytes within a character from appearing like other then it is never safe to do a string search using the regular string search you may find false this is because string comparison in functions such as strpos is and with the exception of which is specifically designed to prevent this encodings suffer the problem that any subsequent byte in a character made up of more than one byte may match part of a different the string you are searching and the string you are searching for are of different character then conversion will always be otherwise find that for any string that would be represented differently in the other it will always return you should do such conversion on decide on a character encoding your app will and be consistent within the any time you receive input in a different convert on the way

disagree with the by bug concept even the tester is inside or of directly counting the number of you can use some rating mechanism concerning the severity i mean to measure the carelessness of the a programmer is writing a code without handling the this problem is bigger than a error in complex logic in a complex so using a rating mechanism for each bug would be better for such a in that case each will get a fair weight and we can get a overall idea about the performance using the sum of the error the other hand this approach also can make problems because the rating is also done by human but having a team for make this rating will reduce such problems and the mechanism will get more usable with the time with necessary improvements and its your duty to sub group the bug categories and assign them the necessary i think you cannot do this at this also should get matured over time with

do you empty a vase containing five if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing four do you empty a vase containing four if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing three do you empty a vase containing three if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing two do you empty a vase containing two if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing one do you empty a vase containing one if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing no do you empty a vase containing no if the vase is not you take out one but the vase is empty so generalize do you empty a vase containing if the vase is not you take out one and then you empty a vase containing can we see that in int flowersinvase flowersinvase 0 take one flower flowersinvase 1 else the vase is nothing to we have just done that in a for recursion can be replaced with but often recursion is more talk about in computer a is a structure made up of where each node has some number of children that are also or a is a tree made of nodes that have exactly typically called and again the children can be or a is a node that is not the child of any other that a in addition to its has a a and imagine that we wish to sum all the values in some sum value in any one we would add the value of node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if now recall that the if not are also to sum the left we would add the value of child node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if to sum the value of the left left we would add the value of child node itself to the value of its left if and the value of its right if anticipated where going with and would like to see some node int root if there is no its sum is root null return 0 else there is a return that instead of explicitly testing the children to see if null or we just make the recursive function return zero for a null say we have a tree that looks like this numbers are the slashes point to and means the pointer points to 4 2 1 we call sumnode on the root node with value we will 5 expand that in everywhere we see replace it with the expansion of the return 5 5 4 5 4 2 null 5 4 2 0 5 4 2 0 1 null 5 4 2 0 1 0 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 null 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 0 0 5 4 2 0 1 0 3 5 4 2 0 1 3 5 4 2 1 3 5 4 3 5 3 5 10 15 see how we conquered a structure of arbitrary depth and by considering it as the repeated application of a composite each time through our sumnode we dealt with only a single using a singe and two simple return statements that almost wrote directly from our to sum a if a node is null its sum is otherwise its sum is its value plus the sum of its left child plus the sum of its right child the power of vase example above is an example of all that means is that in the recursive if we recursed if we called the function that was the last thing we tree example was not tail because even though that last thing we did was to recurse the right before we did that we recursed the left the order in which we called the and added the current value matter at because addition is look at an operation where order does use a binary tree of but this time the value held will be a not a tree will have a special that for any its character comes alphabetical the character held by its left child and alphabetical the character held by its right we want to do is print the tree is alphabetical easy to given the tree special we just print the left then the then right just want to print so pass our function something to print this will be an object with a char we need to worry about how it just that when print is print see that in node char worry about this printer private o void char c out worry about this printer if there is no do root null return else there is a printer value printer root this function returns a printer addition to the order of operations now this example illustrates that we can pass things into a recursive the only thing we have to do is make sure that on each recursive we continue to pass it we passed in a node pointer and a printer to the and on each recursive we passed them if our tree looks like h a j will we we go left where we go left where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to a and are we return to where we print and then go right where we go left where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to i and are we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to j and are we return to h and are return to where we print and then go right n where we go left to where we do nothing and we return to where we print and then go right where we do nothing and we return to n and are so return to k and are so we return to the if we just look at the lines were we we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right return to where we print and then go right we return to where we print and then go right see we printed which is indeed in alphabetical manage to print an entire in alphabetical just by knowing how to print a single node in alphabetical which was just our tree had the special property of ordering values to the left of alphabetically later knowing to print the left child before printing the and tto print the right child after printing the the power of being able to do whole things by knowing only how to do a part of the whole knowing when to stop that in most operator when its first operand is the general recursive function m

goodness not the only know of a library that handles but i can personally vouch for your profiling i once implemented a progress bar which was used to report the progress of a complicated file operation small files were being and then combined into a larger i had the software keep track of the time it took for writes and and then adjusted the progress bar after the program had been run a couple of the progress bar would move as smooth as no pauses and no fast works as long as the time taken for your operations are easily i would be leery of using this method on something like a download progress since the speed of the network is completely

had a geek fight with someone over what the strategy pattern really is and i need a little expert help definitive both agree that the strategy pattern allows for the guts of a class the to be swapped out at runtime while maintaining the same her contention is that to be a you would have to get the same my contention is that swapping an or logic of a class could mean that the results of the overridden operation are but that it still meets the intent of the strategy code example with your any subclasses of a class would be a they have the same method definitions and are therefore a int int temp i temp b int int temp i temp c int int temp i temp a one is not first two are because for any input they will give you the exact same the last one is just because it gives you an int does not make it a they have to the same use a abstraction term just to make them a all do but they are not all doing the thing in a different that is the essence of a the real strategy design pattern please stand	
had a similar design issue writing an asynchronous socket listener for formatted translation of what i came up with into the serialport datareceived model would be something like main class encapsulates the system it will contain the logic for generating the response based on each instance of the class will be bound to a single serial port that can be set during or after there will be a startcommunications type method it will wire up the datareceived event to another method in the this method is responsible for grabbing the data from the and determining if a full message has if it raises its own event on the which will have an appropriate method wired to you could also have it call a predefined method on your class instead of raising an event i defined an event to improve basic design is working just fine in a production and can handle more input than the rest of the systems connected to it

hard answering this since you already link to articles that explains the let me try garbage collection you have memory and since gc will run your you have but resource is in the sense that you know things will be cleaned it is since you know when it will if you open a file and lock it while you have it not knowing when the file will become available to open again later on is but the guarantee that at some point it will be closed is and idisposable serves that bad part by adding deterministic resource you choose when to dispose of your closing the the network the database your and you will typically dispose of the resource when you no longer need when you no longer need the you dispose of the object keeping it the object will stay in memory memory for a while but the file will be closed when you say ready to be opened again right you gain deterministic handling of and couple that with memory management and you got the best of two	
hard to say without being able to see your suspect you are running into robustness issues with your floating point have you considered using integer points or doing some kind of robustness enhancement like eliminating common bits in the floating point is an open source geometry library called geos which might be useful to test your data set out there are also algorithms in geos to perform snap rounding to an integer grid and eliminate common bits to help you determine if you are encountering a robustness of further note is how geos computes the intersection using duality in homogenous space i quite tell if the dot product projection technique you describe is mathmatically equivalant an my favorite solution to compute intersections in a graph of edges is to use a sweepline in conjunction with a monotone chain of when you use monotone you can eliminate a lot of edge intersection since chains never intersect this is what geos

have investigated techniques for doing this and found an interesting approach that people are using with check out and for not sure that this would necessarily solve your speed issue i were doing this in java use an executor to process all of the users feed requests there is something that you can do using etags and in calendar api of calendar api calendar api it shows the etag attribute being returned for each entry in the listing of the that value can be used to cache the whenever the etag for a particular calendar the calendar needs to be refreshed with a new that could save you quite a bit of hopefully the zend gdata api exposes those elements to client

having some trouble with understanding how iis is handling static variables on its my understanding has always been that if iis has 4 worker processes that it can handle 4 requests simultaneously and that it would be the same as having 4 separate threads running the any static variables would persist in each individual the reason a bit confused is that i have a scope that made which manages connections and caching when testing the app i notice any issues but after compiled it and hit it at the same time from two different locations i seem to get a sort of now if these worker processes are separate why would this can more than one request be processed on a single worker thread at the same this is tremendously important as there are unique that are held in these static members to handle escalation of the objects that manage these functions and it appears that they are trying to access the same running this on iis server on an x64 values that need to persist through the thread on a single i put these values into which seems to do the can be used but it may not be available during the entirity of the request in one module that i is only used on a variable to indicate if that thread has already loaded the settings for the cahcing if true then the tread is ready to fetch data from the caching do i prevent static member variables from being accessed by more than one request at a time in

having trouble designing a good architecture for a particular portion of my especially where maintaining state is have a group of parsing class reads in a block of data into a buffer and handles the overall control class takes the block of data in the buffer and a and divides it up into smaller chunks for the to is an interface that i am trying to i think i want to do something like this represents some data structure containing various bits of state that will include a bytebuffer holding the entire block of raw represents information including the position of each chunk within the and any other information the has determined about the void void chunkmetadata void will call to let it set up any state at the beginning of a and is committed to leaving a designated portion of the blockinfo constant until it makes a matching call to afterwards it might reuse the data buffer for the next runs through the data block and splits it into chunks according to a predefined data and will call multiple once for each one reason for the contract to include a buffer that remains is so that can copy the whole block of data at the beginning or and have to reassemble the chunks into the one block when they were there together all the a division of is just responsible for managing the overall routine and reading in the it care less about anything is the thing that splits the data block into chunks and it care less about what to do with them or how the data got is the interface trying to design so that concrete classes can implement it and work without or caring what it or without it caring about how to divide up the block into chunks or where the data came question should the burden on maintaining any state be on the class implementing and kept out of and if the semantics of my interface include the fact that the raw data block in blockinfo will not change between calls of and should i then only pass it in to and not to the other or is it okay to send it along for there a better design pattern to handle a situation like interface how to handle stateful

i came about this concept of design and felt really enthusiastic about can you guys suggest some resources that help me dive into design for learning design	
i create 2 projects one for desktop and one for the desktop version is a desktop exe that just references cf is obviously need to push your main app into librarys and make your actual just a very light wrapper this is quite nice design not actually running on the cf but the ff so there are a few compatability issues you may notice in a difference of the other option is to use the debugging option in visual studio to to that way you can run the app by double clicking and then just attach to that	
i create an abstract property in my base and then a subclass implements is it possible to then reference and use that property in one of my base methods later on once the subclass sets that want to sort of pass a value from my subclass to base class so that in my base class i can perform some logic using it in that base class even not a property but an field i would need to require that field to be set in a subclass if the think even i really need a property if i can set some sort of flag in my subclass via an abstract field so that the base class can use that flag for some logic that my subclass is going to depend on such as sending an i want to be able to set a flag in any subclasses using this base to say true or false so that the base sendrequest method knows whether to chose from a couple of uris that i have set in my base that flag will determine which format to use in the base sendrequest method since each subclass will vary in terms of what uri format the base class should use for that subclass in order to send the httprequest on behalf of the to use abstract property value in a base	
i decided to write this up as a as seen it be useful a number of had users before use for this uses dense binary wire which include any names on the wire just this means names are not exposed on the matter whether the name in the class at runtime is or works by assigning an integer tag to members or for datetime dateofbirth the is used in the but you need to maintain lots of serialization can also be hooked into very easily if you need to use and also has a wcf hook if you the so biased but the tool is so you lose anything by having a look

i have a app which goes thru and generates a series of outputs them to a local directory and then determines if it needs to update an existing file or add a new file into a tfs foundation have a single workspace on my local machine and there are 10 different working folders that are other coding projects i have worked on from this particular my problem happens when i go to check if the file already exists in the tfs project and an update is required or if needs to be added to the project as a new string tfsproject workspaceinfo versioncontrolserver string argpath tfs new workspace this point i check if the file exists and i do one of two if the file then i mark the file for edit and then i writeout the file to the local otherwise i will script the file first and then add the file to the i dont care if the physical file is identical to the one i am generating as i am doing this as a sas70 requirement to it exists i if it all of that to get to the when i go to check on pending changes against the project i get all the pending changes for all of the projects i have on my local machine in the show our pending pendingchanges pendingchange in thought that by setting the workspace to that it would give me only the objects for that particular working there any way to force the workspace object to only deal with a particular working that make any thanks in checking files into tfs getting more than	
i have a number of related classes that all have a method like override type of may change may also be a and the specific property will certainly but the type of the property will always be further that decided silly to have 8 different classes that all do the exact same thing on an implementation toggle a bool especially when all related on a semantic level also all derive from the same abstract base which is where comes to i parameterize the property that i want to toggle without parameterizing the actual toggle operation for i know i can do something like this class action doexecute public protected override b new how i can i capture the toggling behavior in the while still accepting the writable property as a i pass the toggling in as a then just making an just pass the property in is a value so just be toggling a i pass it in by of properties be passed by i feel like got to be something stupid and obvious that just really missing reason doing such a simple thing in an indirect manner is actually due to the use of the gof command pattern in the core functionality are more but this small subset of essentially just toggles a property that will raise propertychanged events instead of having all these commands in separate i wanted to fold them into one because so do i refactor multiple similar methods of this sort into a single

i pointed out in to implement incremental search on a you should use structures like a or for searching patterns in large for discovering patterns in the middle of some text there is one simple i am not sure if it is the most efficent but i usually do it as i insert some new text into the i just insert then remove the first insert remove the second insert again and so on until the whole text is then you can discover every substring of every inserted text by just one search from the that resulting structure is called a and there are a lot of optimizations it is really incredible to find all texts that contain a given sequence of n characters you have to inspect at most n nodes and perform a search on the list of children for every depending on the implementation binary of the child node you might be able to identify the required child node with as few as 5 search steps assuming case insensitive latin letters interpolation sort might be helpful for large alphabets and nodes with many childs as those usually found near the

in a team and we are supposed to be setting up a wifi mesh network to run on google idea is to use the geolocation of each node to generate the ipv6 then use that to choose the closest node as the preferred node for routing some optimisation is made through periodic understanding main of doing a geolocation based algorithm is that each network hop will step physically closer to the and we that travelling in the most direct path to the is going to give us the most optimal routing my problem with this approach is that physical proximity load does not necessarily imply good connection strength or fast what if a thick lead or lots of proximity is a fairly useless metric for determining primary metrics should be primarily based on something signal demonstrated cpu time connected to at least that was my understanding of how routing paths should be is this a good is there something spent a lot of time working with so please put in noobmans wireless mesh routing

in mind that in designing a bound as with an access subtypes impose a heavy cost in terms of if you have a supertype table with three subtype tables and you need to display all three in a single form at once you need to show not just the supertype you end up with a choice of using three outer joins and or you need a union all of three mutually exclusive select statements for each neither of these will be was going to paste some sql from the first major app where i worked with but looking at the sql is so complicated it would just confuse not so much because my app was but because the nature of the problem is complex presenting the full set of data to the both and is by its very nature my conclusion from working with it was that have been better off with only one subtype not to say not useful in some just that bound forms necessarily make it easy to present this data to the

is a conceptual basis for database classical database there are three and conceptual model emerges from requirements and evolves as the underlying subject matter evolves or as understanding of the subject matter the conceptual model pins down elementary data as to form and but deal with such issues as table logical model uses the relational model of it can be derived from the conceptual but it also deals with the composition of normalization and other composition issues come into play the logical model anticipates the table and also the queries and updates the application will physical model implements relations as and also adds all the other features like needed to actually build the derived from the logical but data and disk space all come into sounds lengthy and but actually if you know how to do the whole thing can be done in a matter of while the rest of the team is still debating functional for a really small project 50 it can be done in with just pencil and for larger there are tools that make design more less error and easily what happens when you discover that the conceptual model was inaccurate or and the other two models and the database itself need to be where comes to the data independence does for database design what encapsulation does for object it prevents a minor adjustment in one place from propagating all over the application objects are only dependent on the data that they a new table has to be added to a the chances that any application will be broken is vanishingly even if an existing table has to be queries that only use the old columns see any even when objects are dependent on the you can still give the altered table a new and then create a view with the old name that makes it look like the old table is still physical data independence is almost complete in a good you can reorganize add and drop and you have to change any of the change management can be done brilliantly using the really good dbms products out a lot of the dbas and programmers know how to make adequate use of these dbms even though they have been around for

is a primary concern through development when you have a good reason to expect that performance will be unfixably bad if optimization is a secondary depends a lot what kind of code but there are often better reasons to believe that your code will be unfixably difficult to or or full of or if all those things become secondary to tweaking managers of those things are our primary good managers work to find out which are dangers for this good design does have to consider all these and the earlier you have a estimate of any of the if all your manager is is that if you never think about how fast your code will run then too much of your code will be then i just say that makes optimization your the usp of your software is that faster than your then optimization is a primary with you can often predict what sorts of operations will be the design those with optimization in mind right from the and ignore optimization a lot of projects even need be fast enough without much provided you use sensible algorithms and do anything do anything is always a primary with no need to mention performance in

is a specfic however i believe that the model should be responsible for the validity of its own if this is the case then the validation belongs in the however this may not always be achievable and it may be necessary to perform validation in the however i think this should be in addition to the validation performed in the model not a replacement for problem with only having validation in the view is that at some point you will probably want another view on your your site may become popular and customers are asking for xml based apis to generate their own do you then rely on the customer to validate the if you do not have to provide apis some customers may want customized views that are sufficiently different to warrant a completely different version of the again you now have validation in the views think the ideal scenario is to have your model do the validation but to make the results of the validation available for the view to read and render the page again with the validation results think it is perfectly reasonable to have the view doing validation if you want to instantly display validation data back to the user etc but the final decision on data validity should rest with the

jet autonumber field is not an identity it is only a long integer field with a special default that default value can be increment or but as it is only a default you can append any long integer value to the field as long as it violate the incrementing autonumber will never revert to 1 except if deleted all records and or in the event of a corrupt seed the latter happened frequently in the early versions of jet 4 service pack where the seed value would get and this would lead to all sorts of including corrupted pk that eventually got and because jet is a windows hardly any computer out there is going to have anything less than jet 4 service pack onedaywhen you can get negative values if the incrementing autonumber exceeds the maximum positive value for long but this would indicate to me that you probably have enough records in your table that you need a different database or improperly treating your table as a temp table appending and deleting large numbers of others have also uniqueness is not controlled by the autonumber data but by the if you created a you could append duplicate i imagine why want an autonumber field with duplicate but the point is that you can do it if you add a unique since most autonumber fields are used as surrogate primary they will have the unique pk and the data table will be written in pk order in regard to if you are using an autonumber as a surrogate pk and you have any natural keys in the table that should be unique be no nulls you should also have a unique index on the natural key single field or a compound

just started working for the first time with a product delivered via the linux rpm rather than as a standalone and realized that this makes the test release cycle a bit more i was working with we would just change the build numbering in our build system to mark a build as a test or release candidate instead of a development and tell people to install only the candidate build for the problem with doing that with rpms is that if we change the numbering break the delivery mechanism and installed machines be able to tell which is the latest version of the rpm any best way thought of to get around this is to put the candidate rpms in a completely separate rpm but this also gets complicated because we have multiple rpms coming from the same repository that are on different release so be trying to pull the release candidate version of rpm a from the new repository while still wanting to get development snapshots of rpm b from the development must be a pretty common issue for linux so can anyone tell me the best practice thanks in advance a release cycle with a product delivered via

know at least in this value is configurable and so i doubt get a definitive answer on this the default is are you attempting to	
know at so anything i say about should be taken with a grain of i will try to explain what goes on in that piece of ruby has something called these have nothing to do with the singleton software design they are just methods that are defined for one and only one you can have two instances of the same and add methods to one of those two are two different syntaxes for singleton one is to just prefix the name of the method with the so would define a method only for object the other method is called up the singleton and it looks syntactically similar to defining a because also what happens singleton methods actually live in an invisible class that gets inserted between the object and its actual class in the class syntax looks like this opens up the singleton class of object and every method defined inside of that class body becomes a singleton method of object is this used ruby is a pure which means that including classes is an if methods can be added to individual and classes are this means that methods can be added to individual in other ruby has no need for the artificial distinction between regular methods and static methods are a they really just glorified what is a static method in is just a regular method on a class singleton of this is just a longwinded way of explaining that everything defined between and its corresponding becomes every variable that starts with a capital is actually a in this case we translate these as but rather an because how they are caches data received from a the difference between this method and usual is this method caches data and allows to data when it is expired data generation code more than once so bring our servers def ttl method has three parameters we will see exactly two of them are optional and both of them have a default in the case of the default value really it serves more as a marker to find out whether the argument was passed in or is an extension that the library adds to the it actually do it just returns it is used in this case just to make the method definition more are other methods which do something more which returns and and so we will use this as an that the type of the parameter should not be but rather fallback to default caching approach if no ttl return yield unless contains several complex ruby start with the easiest trailing conditional if a conditional body contains only one then the conditional can be appended to the end of the instead of saying a b then foo you can also say if a the above is equivalent to ttl then return yield next one is also is just syntactic sugar for we are now at not ttl then return yield is truth in truth is pretty falseness is pretty and truth falls out the special keyword is and the special keyword is everything else is in this case the conditional will be if is either or a terrible sensible value for a so the only interesting one is the snippet would have been more clearly written like then return yield since the default value for the parameter is this conditional is if no argument was passed in for the conditional is used to figure out with how many arguments the method was which means that we are not going to translate it as a conditional but rather as a method on to the in every method can accept an implicit code block as an why i wrote above that the method actually takes not a code block is just an anonymous piece of code that can be passed stored in a and invoked later ruby inherits blocks from but the concept dates all the way back to to lambda at the mention of anonymous code but at the very least at the mention of lambda you should know how to represent this implicit fourth method a delegate more a it transfers control to the basically just a very convenient way of invoking a without having to explicitly store it in a variable and then calling create window for data ttl syntax is called it means the token inside the string with whatever the result of evaluating the expression between the just a very concise version of which is exactly what we are going to translate it try to get data from value stale if stale key has it is time to our unless value nil force data if no data retrieved or data data and reset stale unless value return is my feeble attempt at translating the ruby version to class static const enum stale created caches data received from a the difference between this method and usual is this method caches data and allows to data when it is expired data generation code more than once so bring our servers public static tvalue timespan timespan create window for data var realttl ttl generationtime var stalekey try to get data from var value var stale if stale key has it is time to our if is value force data if no data retrieved or data data and reset stale if is value return fallback to default caching approach if no ttl public static tvalue return simulate default argument for has default so this be public static tvalue timespan return new convenience overloads to allow calling it the same way as in by just passing in the timespans as integers in public static tvalue int int return new new public static tvalue int return new note that i do not know i do not know i have not tested i even know if it is syntactically hope it helps

lot of people here are saying stuff about going to make a new the the server side is fast becoming especially when you consider your criteria interactivity of you want to learn 4 core and if you think you know them or can figure them out without probably the standards have evolved for too and way too easy to get a clouded picture of things should be if you just try to learn by standard know in and not in think you know do you know the difference between a block level element and an inline do you know which elements are allowed in which other css or i recommend the definitive know css selectors inside and need them for technology be stunned at what can be accomplished in which you thought you could only do with tons of tags in not no longer a joke language that it running the most most and interesting sites around so glorious i find myself not able to even speak of maybe the commenters will be less overcome with glorious aura and will be able to breathe its all of the really impressive is on the client side the language mean as i love linq i doubted it at but i am drinking that by the gallon these but if you choose php or ror or java or but that should be a secondary learn the 4 technologies above first need them no matter what doing on the	
lot of these are good rules of thumb for print designers who want to learn how to actually markup html and write but as a web developer in the frequently just take a template and write the html and css for whether or not that task was simple or difficult depended on the awareness of the capabilities of was one pain point in particular that kept coming so for print designers moving to the the absolute number one rule to remember design any element to have an you can restrict the width all you but changing preferred font and different text strings being pulled from the database on different pages means that text needs to be able to flow vertically generating overflow who remember this can usually conjure up designs that are easy to cut up and integrate in a mostly semantic designers who forget this sometimes end up creating designs that have to be shoehorned into a 3 inch by 3 inch and when i reach for the

modeling a a project can have many people working on and a person can work on multiple modeling the relation as a project which in addition to serving as a link from person also records a roletype and of that person filling that roletype on that how the english work stands in for the database fk in a of those we can in the database follow the graph from through project to person a join b on project c on we can follow it in the other from person a join b on project c on like to be able to do the same in the so we want a person to have a and project to have a and a projectrole references to a person and a should really be unless we decide that is a convenience method of the p new projectrole have a it reference to a person and a reference to a it also as a start an end and a roletype either is an or a class instance that mimics an enum value that there is only one object per enum and immutable and and thus sharable among many this mean that retrieving a person from the database should cause the whole database to be reified in the object graph in the lazy proxies that retrieve only on use can save us from then if only currently concerned with the and not his roles we can just retrieve the for i think does this i think this is a standard way of representing standard for a relation to have additional data what kind pretty much got the right and are just being rightly conscientious in getting feedback

one and most answers on thread assume that the whole collection can be constructed in you normally create a collection of anonymous type in a single if you need more you may end up with a pretty useless collection of different anonymous types are useful when you create them in a single and use them right if the creation of the collection or the further processing is a bit more the anonymous type loses some of for you efficiently pass an anonymous type along to a method for as the method know the type of the object and thus have to use reflection to get anything out of you are going to repeatedly look for items in this collection of anonymous you may want to create a named type so that you can put them in a dictionary for much faster

question relates to question on jena ontmodel i have jena models on two machines that need to remain synchronized over the main issue that i need to address is that the models may contain anonymous nodes which can originate in any of the am i on the right track or is there a more robust approach that failing to can think of 3 approaches to this the complete this is prohibitively expensive for synchronizing small since changes can occur on either i just replace machine model with the serialized model from machine i need to merge a partial use a dedicated model for serialization that only contains the changes that need to be sent over the this approach requires special vocabulary to represent statements that were from the when i serialize the model from machine a to machine anonymous node ids will be unique to machine a but may overlap with ids for anonymous nodes created on machine have to rename anonymous nodes and keep a mapping from machine anon ids to machine ids in order to handle future changes individual this approach requires no special but may not be as are there issues other than anonymous nodes that i just encountered globally unique bnode ids we can generate globally unique ids for anonymous nodes by prefixing the id with a unique machine i figured out to tell jena to use my id instead of its this would allow us to serialize individual statements without remapping bnode an example to ground this discussion a bit suppose i have a list on machine a represented serialize this model from machine a to machine because machine b may already have an anonymous node with id i remap id to a new id the list changes on machine machine b has never encountered machine id it adds a new mapping from machine id to a new id problem is further complicated with more than two if there is a third machine for it may have own anonymous node that is different from machine anonymous node machine b really does need to keep a map from each of the other anonymous node ids to its local not just from remote ids in general to local when processing incoming it must take into account where the changes came from to map the ids jena ontmodels with

really quite easy to a on your computer without paying a hosting a computer connected to the internet that runs a from a call it to have an ns record that points users to the computer from step that any subdomain queries like and will get sent to that dns entries on the computer from step 1 to send users to the right like redirect all to your done any dns requests that query for will get sent to your and it will reply with gets tricker if you have a static ip for the computer from step but there are free services to get around such as seeing how cheap hosting is you might be better off just hosting it really saves your a lot of extra at a small cost to after the i realize you may have meant just setting up a dns domain within your lan or some other private i think the threw me

reason why it is not safe to instanciate a vector of is that there is an algorithm that will do a copy of one object in your container on the implements quicksort which needs a therefore deleting it when going out of scpope of the well any or function of your own that are able to take your container as and copy one of its object on the stack will cause this issue as a in your it is simple you must ensure your class does not behaves as an or ensure you will never call such that can delete your underlying the first solution is according to me your copy constructor and your affectation operator as should not give away property of the pointer best way to achieve that is to wrapp a boost smart pointer instead of an to make your container safe when calling such the way according to defining a better copy operator to bypass this issue is not a good i see a good copy constructor implementation affectation operator as that could keep safe the result of applying the	
reason why your code work is due to how php handles indexed arrays inside you what php wanted to see single quotes this you only omit those single quotes if you are referencing a variable directly inside a that string such as can work with simple arrays but not with arrays of arrays unless you use curly braces note the single quotes in the curly exactly like normal string but rather more like referencing a variable elsewhere in

references represent the variable you make a reference to a you thinking of it as way of accessing the you should think of it as being the variable would you reset a and what use would it the problem is in your point to the same do not they just so happens they are implemented using for op missing the point of did you read a reference is an just another way of accessing the same a main have a class that takes up 500 mb of so copying this class is too which means a not an since the original class will be copied onto the stack and the function so in we did is the class is not copied and we can still access but the problem is if we check for doing lots of functions return if function was passed the the point of references you need to copy the but you also can have a you need to check for null because it cannot yet got the you have an to the not a copy or reseating them would be how would the syntax references are not like they point to an there anything to change about a reference because a reference a the reference itself takes no the address of the reference is the address of the along with the just another way of getting some sure what else to when people do strange like another answer but if something does that they deserve a

relational database paradigm makes some assumptions about usage of relation consists of an unordered set of rows in a relation have the same set of column has a fixed name and data type and semantic meaning on all in a relation are identified by unique values in primary key assumptions support simplicity and at the cost of some not all data management tasks fit into this kind of entities with complex attributes or variable attributes do for if you need flexibility in areas where a relational database solution support you need to use a different kind of are other solutions for managing data with different semantic web for allows each entity to define its own attributes and to be by treating metadata as attributes just like this is more flexible than the structure imposed by a relational but that flexibility comes with a cost of its you should use the right tool for each also my other answer to

short answer is the long answer is there any great classes exposed to manipulate rich text items in however a few that you can research are the and notesrichtexttable to name a these classes help you define some rich text elements and add them programmatically to your rich text since sending is to use the notesmimeentity classes and build the email using html way some sample s new docmail as body as stream as db false do not convert mime to rich email to be docmail send to from from reply to set stream body html code goes used because of technote found on docmail body stream true restore need to turn the convertmime setting off in the then create a new set the mail that part is already in your vba create the mimeentity and a stream to hold your html finally call the setcontentfromtext method on your mimeentity then send your note the last call is to turn the convertmime feature back on for the not sure if this will all work via but it does work well in lotusscript agents in hope this

technical answer to your original question is a qualified all objects opened from an are automatically disposed when the is in practice it is a good idea to dispose an as soon as done with it to reduce memory especially when working with code like this that opens several this behavior for linq is actually quite simple in you can find full details in but the short version is that a iterator can handle disposal for using my extension your code is relatively safe written like spsite var sw from spweb web in where from spweb subweb in select asubweb in do the result of your which assigned to is a lazy iterator of type as you enumerate over that each will be disposed when the enumerator moves to the next this means that it is not safe to use that or any object created from it outside of your also would not be safe to use outside of that block because the will be tied to the code like this that enumerates over all webs is extremely there is almost certainly a more efficient way that this could be if only by using instead of your garbage these objects require disposal because of unmanaged memory allocated that the gc even know a word of caution about your if using in your helper method to get your elevated there are a number of issues you could run into by returning your out of that elevated if i would suggest using impersonation instead my preferred method is described

terms often have precise meanings in the standards for various when that is the case they should not be c for function may be only once you say what it but it may also be before that you say what arguments it takes and what type it a variable is when you say what type it and this happens only once for each but you may a value languages also differentiate between a variable a value at declaration and the value

that should be posible with some of dealying the you can stop it before it reaches original clone it and then refire the clone after the you know how events work in the displaylist you can in flash let me first explain you click a button a mouseevent is it begin in the capturing fase where it starts on the stage calling all eventlisteners registered for the event in the order of the priority set when the listeners was if listerners has the same priority default is the are called in a random order the order that they where all listeners for the stage has been called the next displayobject in the list of the buttons ancestors is and the same thing happens continue all the way down to inner most displayobject that allow mouse events be a textfield label inside the the capturing phase ends and the target phase all the listeners on the innermost object is called in the target the bubbling phase where all the listernes are called on parents and grandparents all the way up to the stage in the same manner as before from the inside should be noted that in flash the target phase is handled as part of the bubbling how can we use when you register and event listener you specify the phase and the defaults are bubbling phase and priority so if we register a click event listener on the stage for the capturing phase with priority we would get the event before any other listerne except perhaps another identical following code would prevent click events to registered by other raises some other firstly you want to do it for solution would be be to have of all buttons that should events and it with solution would be to have that require a an interface call and then simple is third solution would be to for the events on a a since it that you would use the it reaches this parent the first two solutions you should prevent mouseinteraction for the children of the buttons to simplify detection matter what you choose next you would have to delay with a simple and then fire the event again after the raises the problem of not delaying the refired my suggestion would be to instead fire an event object that inherits from mouseevent instead of a simple the mouseevent is very simple to it only has a few so when you capture it the second time you can check if its a normal mouse click or your the solution with the inface on the it would be something is idelaybutton is code for the cloning and refiring the event might need to listen for more types of events but most of the code can be made generic enough to include that helps and sorry about the long

the actual reason for using instead of a specific delegate is that treats separately declared delegates as totally different though and both have identical argument and return they are not so if every library declared its own delegate type for each delegate those libraries would not be able to interoperate unless the user inserts delegates to perform declare two delegate completely identical but different public delegate void public delegate void a method that is compatible with either of public static void static void can assign any method having the right exceptionhandler1 x1 and yet cannot assign a delegate with identical exceptionhandler2 x2 error at compile encouraging everyone to use microsoft is hoping that this will alleviate the problem of incompatible delegate delegates will play nicely because they will just be matched up based on their solve all because have or but those are less commonly in the comments svish switching a parameter type func to predicate seem to make at least it still without any as long as your program only assigns methods to as in the first line of my the compiler silently generates code to new a delegate object that forwards on to the so in my i could change to be of type without causing a on the second line i try to assign the first delegate to another even thought that 2nd delegate type has exactly the same parameter and return the compiler gives error cannot implicitly convert type to this will make it static bool return x void p f p not method is a perfectly good thing to assign to the and as long as i do so but then i assign one of those variables to the	
the answer below is only valid for java ee as was brought to my attention in one of the other java ee 6 does support so if using java ee read this but read the other relevant my own research and from the responses to this question the answer i found is the although jaas is a standard there is no uniform way to deploy and integrate a jaas realm loginmodule in various application v2 requires you to extend some of its own internal classes that implement loginmodule or realm you can however not customize the whole login process because many methods of the loginmodule interface are marked final in the custom loginmodule and realm classes must be placed in the as classpath the and the realm must be manually registered deployment from the situation seems to be a bit better for which will let you code your own realm and loginmodule and then configure them into the application server using its own jaasrealm will delegate the actual work to your implementations of realm and even tomcat allow deploying your custom realm from your that none of the application servers that showed up my results seem to be able to take full advantage of all the jaas all of them seem to only support the basic if you need anything more complicated than then you will need to find a solution that is not managed by your java ee and because it was asked for in the comments to my here is the code i wrote for of the realm class webservicerealm extends appservrealm static final logger log string string int string void throws nosuchrealmexception webservice realm read the configuration properties from the use reasonable default values if not string configport port configport using default port string return enumeration throws nosuchuserexception list groupnames new return string return webservice string return int return string return then the loginmodule class webserviceloginmodule extends appservpasswordloginmodule all variables starting with are supplied by the and must be in void throws loginexception if null throw new and password cannot be groups must be called as last operation of the login boolean throws loginexception if return fetch some more information through the return webserviceclient return in the realm has to be tied to the this is done at the jaas configuration file which in glassfish v2 lies at add the following lines at the end of that use whatever string is returned from you is what got things working for me on this solution is not portable across application but as far as i can there is no existing portable

the version that i would recommend except with as has been pointed there was a typo on but here are a few other things that i notice that can cause of you be using the file constructor you should instead use the open you should avoid calling a close method outside a finally in this used python with you can use this in python with the following import will prevent the file from being stuck open if an exception is thrown anywhere it will close the file when the with block is although this the cause of your it is an important thing to remember because if one of the file methods throws an the file will get held open in that you should probably accept jarret answer he caught the bug

there is a new idiom in that is nice and may help you in some it is not fully what you but sometimes i think you will like underscore is a valid it is becoming a common idiom to use it as a parameter name to a lambda in cases where you plan to ignore the parameter if other coders are aware of the they will know immediately that the parameter is to conveys your and easier on the eyes as if passing your lambda to something that expects an expression this may not because now passing a lambda instead of a for many it is a nice can find out more about it	
there is a why see in msdn it will often say class is threadsafe for static something like it means when ms wrote the they intentionally used synchronization primitives to make the static members this is common when writing libraries and because it is easier to make static members threadsafe than instance because you know what the library user is going to want to do with if they made instance members threadsafe for many of the library they would put too many restrictions on you so often they let you handle you likewise need to make your static members threadsafe document that they the static are threadsafe in a the clr will make sure they are called only once and will prevent 2 threads from getting into a static marc pointed out in the comments an edge case in which static constructors are not if you use reflection to explicitly call a static apparently you can call it more than so i revise the statement as as long as you are relying on the clr to decide when to call your static then the clr will prevent it from being called more than and it will also prevent the static ctor from being called

think i can agree with that as a are definitely cases where a relative link makes more with a directory tree of a for if the project is or moved into another absolute links could be confusing if you are talking about there will be cases where relative links make and other times compare having a link to a very generic like grep versus something like multiple versions and target flavors of the gnu compiler tools living on the same in the latter absolute links to the specific tool versions will probably all comes back to what you really want to do in each the general answer is that there is no generalized

think structures are great if you need copy the object or do not want it to be modified by the passed since passed functions can not modify the originally passed structure instead got a new copy of this can be a life they passed as byref and can save you trouble of deep copy craziness in or implementing pain of an iclonesomething the general idea is defining a custom data structure in a more semantic moving to a if you are moving into a class where be part of a generally this is good practice since your structure is of the time related with one of you classes not related with a you are converting it to a class then you need to consider it defining a data and it since gonna be copied all over the you want to get affected by modifications done by the

think that the most important letter in mvc is v for working with ajax with and js is part of presentation layer so by theory it is place for view is responsible for what you send to end and mvc patter is there not only to separate view and controller but to enable us multiple views for the same data model it is best to encapsulate code in a class and use that same controller code to render different in first case that could be drawing of a static but in other scenario it is view specially designed for ajax calls and data may be in json or other standard format it as long as you respect responsibilities that every layer

think you should separate the rendering from the game have at least two different kind of entity that holds the data and logic it should what happens if it runs out of hit that is the particles attached to the representation can access the entity so it knows the hit a controller if the entity can be directly controlled by a human or an ai a car in a car that sounds like the there are lots of resources about see article from or guerrilla guide to game by jorrit for your animation for a dying when the model updates its entity and figures out it has no more hit it could set a flag to say dead and remove the entity from the game from then when the view it reads the flag and starts the dying but it can be difficult to decide where to store this flag since the entity object should a better way in my humble when your entity you could send an event to all listeners that are registered to the unitdiedevent that belongs to this specific then remove the entity from the the entity representation object is listening to that and its handler starts the dying when the animation is the entity representation can finally be design can be

those things are still i do a fair bit of that kind of optimization to be mostly writing code that has to do relatively complex things in about 10ms on an if writing code running on more modern cpus then the benefits be as you care about and doing a fair bit of then you might also look at using whatever vector operations are available on your target platform sse on altivec on compilers easily use these instructions without a lot of and the intrinsics are pretty easy to use these another thing not mentioned in the document you linked to is pointer you can sometimes get good speed improvements if your compiler has support for some kind of of thinking about cache usage can be reorganizing your code and data in a way that makes good use of the cache can result in dramatic speed increases compared to optimizing away the odd copy or unrolling a the most important thing is to only optimize code actually make sure your optimization actually makes it and look at the disassembly to see what optimizations the compiler is already doing for you before you try to improve

till a while a ago my code base was very close to every time i changed an even mildly important file practically all the files got main reason for such high header dependency was that i have many small functions that need to be inline and i was under the impression that for inline to work they need to be in the same translation unit as the calling so they need to be in the for the inline function to even compile other headers need to be included in the header as ad code visual one of the main stated advantages of this is that now inline function can cross translation still how can i really be sure that these functions really get i realize that the compiler can basically do whatever the hell it wants no matter where i define the there a way to check what gets inline functions and link time code

used pointing to shared code in practice for a few years we have had some interesting problems with it that you should probably consider before using it here is the structure that we directories in both and in a project contain external definitions that pull in the common svn pget on lib1 lib2 problem that run into is multifaceted but related to tagging and branching our source as the projects change throughout the externals definition that i showed above has a few pretty severe problems if you want to have reproducible refers to a dynamic target refer to an explicit you branch using the externals are copied verbatim since they are really just properties attached to the some of the other svn commands and actually interpret the when you tag a you really want to preserve the state of the project for all this means that you have to the externals to a specific revision so you need to change the externals definition to explicit refer to the revision that you want this solves one facet of the you have to maintain multiple incompatible branches of the common then you have to specify which branch you want explicitly along with the to this can be a bit of a luckily someone out there in subversion land write the script that automates some of this we are still have struggling with some of the difficulties supporting this in a field deployed product with a bunch of shared code and a mandate of three different versions in the field at any you do go down this then be sure to consider how you will maintain the linkages as the projects grow and found that a little bit of time thinking about a process will go a long way

uses while it uses il as an intermediate has compiled to native il is never directly interpreted for execution as java bytecode you can even the il before if you really want to performance is normally better the long if you idea that is slow is some of the are but if you know what doing itself is a very speedy in this day and age it generally comes down to the algorithm language choice help you if you implement a bad bubble if helps you use more efficient algorithms from a higher level in my experience it generally that will trump any of the other speed on your i also want to explain the compilation path is compiled to this il is distributed to local a user runs the and that program is then to native code for that machine the next time the user runs the program on that machine running a there is also a jit optimizer that can muddy things a but the general reason you do it this way is to allow individual machines to make optimizations appropriate to that you end up with faster code on average than if you distributed the same app to first thing to note is that you can to native code before distribution if you really want at this point close to the same level as if you had distributed a native that stop a determined also largely misunderstands the economics at someone might perhaps your but this assumes that all the value of the app is in the very common for a programmer to the and undervalue the execution of the interface connecting with and if you do all of that a little extra competition will help you as much as it hurts by building up demand in your if you do it hiding your algorithm save more worried about your app showing up on warez even more show up there a much better strategy is to those the the biggest impediment to adoption is that the framework redistributable has become mammoth in hopefully address that in a relatively near

using with and been using nh lazy load so but the performance penalties are too big to so starting to use what read so not an easy using nh entities with lazy loading and serializing to but the benefits are too great to code found serialization with been able to get wcf to recognize the basic also creating the datacontractserializer like override xmlobjectserializer xmldictionarystring xmldictionarystring return new true preserve new problem is when i have something like class poscustomer private branch public virtual branch get return set belongstobranch class branch private poscustomer public virtual poscustomer get return set defaultposcustomer and are two unrelated but the same for example branch 200 has defaultposcustomer and poscustomer has belongstobranch problem is that when wcf tries to serialize the object it bounces between defaultposcustomer and as if recognize that the same entities and that it has already serialized until it runs into stack i turn off the lazy true on these the serialization works just does datacontractserializer decides that an entity has already been can i stop this there perhaps some other way to serialize lazy loading entities with wcf been considering another of creating something similar to nhibernate but replace the properties that are related to other classes with the raw so instead of having a property of type have a property of type int with the value this way i might be able to avoid the cycle problem ran but try this as a last as it would be pretty complicated to got a lot of so creating a dto for each one is out of the and creating it dynamically would be so rather avoid that or use it as last i also need to do business logic on the server so be needing the entities rather than the raw no luck going the direct go with creating the dto which seems to be serialization and nhibernate lazy	
usual pattern for a page you must have personally i hate is your download will begin if it the same with a instead of the either way should behave pretty much the meta refresh approach also but still the address bar changes to the url of the file and the underlying window is blank after the file is there a version online that can be when the browser is pushed to a direct file download by any normal method it should keep the previous page environment allow me to set so p3p is have to use headers to set p3p an html tag works just as why would you need if the target url is just serving a there is no need to set a cookie at so why bother with desperately trying to avoid to dodge any popup blocker you in response to a user there are no blocker that you should need to open a just to download a file i am beginning to think there is something highly strange about the file download destination you are linking not a file download at all but some kind of odd html web linking to a download is not you just link to the job you seem to be making this much harder than it intrinsically only usual problem with just linking to a file is that if it contains xml or an the browser will display it inline instead of downloading the only way to defeat this is using the either by serving it through a script that sets this or by configuring your web server to send that header for all file if you do either of those in your server there is no

was avoiding writing what may seem like another thread on but bear with hopefully like others still am not satisfied or clear on the best approach to take given trends and new emerging technologies when it comes to selecting an architecture to use for enterprise suppose i am seeking mass community opinion on the direction and architectural implementation would chose when building an enterprise application utilising most facets of technology and what direction you would i better make this about me and my in fear of this being too vague i would like to improve my architecture to improve and would really like to hear what you guys think given the list of technologies i am about to and all best practices and architectural patterns you would suggest are welcome and if you have created a solution before for a similar type any pitfalls or caveats you may have hit or is a list of technologies adopted in my latest yep pretty much everything except wpf client by smart to by sql server and additional components to injection management testing currently have this running in an adopting a design pattern utilising sure of formal and the repository most of my structure was adopted from suppose i am more or less happy with most of my tiers really just the dal which i am a bit uneasy i these are the real questions i have faced with my current have a big question mark on if i should have a custom data access layer given the use of linq to should i perform linq to sql directly in my layer or in a dal in a repository should you create a new instance of your db context in each repository method call or one in the class you believe we can truly use poco old clr when using linq to i would love to see some examples as i encountered problems and it would have been particularly handy with the wcf work as i obviously be carrying l2s objects across the an mvc project by itself quite clearly displays the design pattern you should by keeping view logic in the controller calling methods and of course your data access in the but would you drop the facet for larger particularly where the data access is what approach would you take to get your for hearing me out and would love to see sample on architectures and how it is as said i have seen i am yet to really go through oxite but just thought it would benefit myself and additional question in dal bullet design practices for architecture with linq to sql can we truly use design pattern to

was wondering if it was possible to get the nth return value from a function without having to create dummy variables for all return values before say i have the following function in suppose that only interested in the third return this can be accomplished by creating one dummy but i think this is kind of would think that you might be able to do something like one of the following but you there any elegant ways to do this that do far the best solution is to simply use the variablethatiwilluse as a dummy this saves me from having to create a real dummy variable that polutes the workspace that i would need to in the solution is to use the variablethatiwilluse for every return value up until the interesting return values after can simply be still think this is very ugly but if there is no better then i guess accept the to elegantly ignore some return values of a matlab

work for a billing service that uses some complicated billing software for core we have all kinds of codes we set up that are used for tracking payment provider each type of code has a completely different set of data items that control what the code does and how it am tasked with building a new system for tracking changes made to these we want to know who requested what it was and and what the exact setup looked like for that the current process only tracks two of the different types of this project will add immediate support for a with the goal of also making it easy to add additional code types into the same process at a later my design conundrum is that each code type has a different set of data that needs to be configured with of varying so i have a few choices could give each code type own and build them considering we only have three codes concerned about at the this would be this concept has already failed or i be building a new system in the first also weak in that the code involved in writing generic source code at the presentation level to display request data for any code type those not yet is not a db schema capable of storing the data points associated with each code not only but what type they are and how they should be displayed list from an enum of some i have a decent db schema for this but it just feels overly complicated to query and and it ultimately requires a custom query to view full data in nice tabular for for each code type the data points for each code request as this greatly simplifies the database design and will hopefully make it easier to build the just set up a schema for each code then have code that validates requests to their transforms a schema into display widgets and maps an actual request item onto the what this item lacks is how to handle changes to the questions how would you do am i missing any big design any other to those current inclination is to go with the xml given the schema updates are expected but extremely infrequent less than one per code type per 18 should i just build it to assume the schema never but so that i can easily add support for a changing schema what would that look like in sql server 2000 moving to sql server but that be ready until after this project is supposed to be reason thinking xml is that some of the data will be enumerated drop down but i really need to query any of so i was thinking it would be easier to define this data in xml le point about introducing a whole new technology hit very close to we currently use very little xml slowly but at the moment this would look a little out of also not entirely sure how to build an input form from a and then merge a record that matches that schema into the form in an elegant it will be very common to only store a record and so i want to build the form from the record a topic for a different on all the comments so far xml is still the leading separate tables may be as good or but i have the feeling that my manager would see that as not different or generic enough compared to what currently design help with varying

worked on databases where we tried to create tables with 2b rows of data that we got to 500m and one of the biggest gotchas of working with such large table was the time taken to do deletions i often see the approach where old records are archived and then deleted from the main if the table is big enough that deletion will run for many hours as the indexes are sure where the cut off is but gut feel indicates a table 10m rows is probably too our approach was to partition data by so we ended up with a table for a week of and another summary table for and another summary for years very common in btw this was on sql interested to know if the are better at this type of stuff

would suggest you try and make your mysql environment and you environment to both use a universal datetime format rather than a localised then you can use to use a reliable format at all from that you should be able to pass your dates to your database as date typed parameters rather than as a string and therefore it will handle the underlying conversion for i use sqlserver though not mysql so i know if you get the same	
would think that with a clustered index on the that access will still be screaming and you are really storing about the same amount of data as you would with the think that with a properties table you will end up storing much more than what you actually namely the extra index of the user the property key and the fact that the property value will need to be able to handle values of a generic nature making it difficult to advice is to try to put it all in one table and then fire it up with some test it work then you could go down the path of a multiple table solution or even a solution silver bullets after

you are using forms this property already exists in the object your you can solve you problem doing something like this url to i think you real problem is checking that the current user is the one that can edit the current that you can do an extension method on the object url to extension would look like something like that static class public static bool myuser bool retour get your blog from the blog blog check if the principal is the retour return	
you are using nhibernate here is the pertinent that	
you are using selecteditem is most probably the object being you can use but have to cast it this might be better performance since you will not have to perform a string parse to get your category you can use the property which you may have configured using the databinding or the property datavaluefield on the you cannot use a or vb like syntax to perform a cast to an int32 using you use the selectedvalue have a string and to convert it to an have to write something like this value	
you binding your listview in make sure you are only doing that on	
you call linq to sql examines the set of known objects to determine whether new instances have been attached to if they these new instances are added to the set of tracked before any actual changes are to sql starts a transaction to encapsulate the series of individual changes to the objects are translated one by one to sql commands and sent to the this any errors detected by the database cause the submission process to and an exception is changes to the database are rolled back as if no submissions ever more info on this view the this	
you call that deluding still a programming just one that tries to mimic natural language and i suspect that it will fail once you get into implementation in order to make in have to put restrictions on the syntax that will confuse the users been led to think that writing advantage of a dsl is should at any is that simple and yet powerful in regard to the problem mimicking a natural language is a secondary and may in fact be to those primary someone is too stupid or lacks the ability for formally rigorous thinking required for then a programming language that mimicks a natural one will not magically turn them into a cobol was some people seriously believed that within 10 years there would be zero demand for professional since cobol was and anyone who needed software could write it and we all know how been working	
you calling the virtual method from the constructor of a base that could be the if calling a pure virtual method from class in and it is only actually defined in class you might end up accessing a vtable record that has not yet been because constructor has not been executed at that	
you can do these examples even require you could roll your own rack interface content	
you can do with an app that has very variable heap requirements is to set your max heap size very high with and tune and so that the app will not hang on to a lot of memory when the heap shrinks does that with default note that this may cause performance problems when the memory actually used by the app varies both strongly and quickly in that case better off having it hang on to all the memory rather than give it back to the os only to claim it again a second you might also want to fiddle with the to ensure that the gc leave too much unclaimed objects lying which it tends to do when a lot of room for the heap to and which would defeat the goal of wanting the heap size to adjust to the	
you can get away from ftp and use sftp then you can use key and store your public key at on the server in	
you can only pass the arguments as a see the if writing variadic functions functions which take a variable number of in you should write two versions of each one which takes an ellipsis and one which takes a the version taking an ellipsis should call call the version taking a call and no need for code duplication between the two versions of the since one calls the	
you cannot port it while maintaining the you can get pretty static class public static if throw new return new private static if yield return foreach x in foreach permutation in x x yield return	
you care about you definitely if iterating through the thing to find a certain element with any going to be worth it to use a hash if a rare and the ordinary use of the list is not a then no reason to worry about	
you check out i am not sure about the exact support of nested types but i was pretty happy with the results last time i used	
you checked your references and references in ref as smsg as since brokenreference for each ref in since at least if smsg smsg if smsg vbcrlf smsg vbcrlf smsg vbcrlf smsg vbcrlf smsg vbcrlf smsg vbcrlf smsg smsg vbcrlf end msgbox	
you connect directly to a database you need to use a web however to simplify things you can call a data web service such as sql server data services or amazon otherwise use	
you considered sitting on chair with a desk in front if your talking egronomics then thats a pretty good	
you considered the csv module for working with csv docs for csv	
you considered these are basically to tables which are hosted on a different databases on a can create a federated table locally and use that to enforce referential i cannot overemphasize the fact that this approach is fraught with future gotchas and not at all	
you could just hack it to use if the progress bar you have to make sure the source and dest names are properly escaped for a system the tag makes scp copy the files as it does between so it will show a progress	
you could use the it has a	
you create an index on a column or number of columns in ms sql server using version you can specify that the index on each column be either ascending or having a hard time understanding why this choice is even using binary sort a lookup be just as fast either what difference does it make which order i server indexes ascending or what difference does it	
you do not want to provide values for all columns that exists in your to specify the columns that you want to is otherwise how should or any other know for which columns providing a what you have to do is into mytable values 3 be sure that you omit the primary key column is the autonumber access will set it to the next value by can then retrieve the value of the newly inserted record by executing a from	
you ever heard the phrase if optimized of your and this is the only thing if wasting your

you go to it is automatically redirected to does one to the using shared so my options of configuring the server are do you implement simple website	
you have a css framework chosen out or hard to create a system of standards a i would work with your developers to choose a common framework grid or your own custom is often developed after the html is however having a set of reusable css already in place informs every party involved of the kind of stuff that has to be in there are a million ways to implement layout using and a predetermined method of implementation chosen from the start is you know what kind of cross browser challenges will exist even instead of having to hash those out every the other cool consequence of a css framework is that you can then have graphic design people use the grid system utilized by the framework and speed development even choose the common css and then move from there to get something working that all	
you have a lan with developer perhaps you should try implementing a distributed compiler such as might not help if all of the time during the build is spent analyzing or doing some single serial for the raw crunch of compiling many source files into object parallel building obviously as suggested a single by parallelizing across multiple machines can take it even	
you have a object in a typical blog a blog post can have different statuses like et what are the best ways to handle specifically regarding storing this data in the database in a meaningful way as well as in a meaningful way in seen these stored as an int associated with a row in the database the table in this sometimes a lookup table in the database to explain these statuses status table with translate these into an enum in the data access layer to have a more meaningful code representation and to avoid having this solution has a developer updating two different places and to add or change a status a better way to do this seems to be a type of problem run into frequently but never seen a good way to handle code design	
you have a you need to ensure that the a base class constructor that exists is being by i believe the compiler attempts to align constructors one for but if not the functionality you want or that constructor you need to define the base class constructor to	
you have access to the server via or would also be an option if enabled on the imap is probably the way to go if got	
you have an index file in the	
you have foo foo return call it foo but the problem is that now is a dangling because the temporary object created by the call to gets freed after bar the detailed execution sequence here foo is is called with a reference to the temporary returns the that bar has returned the temporary foo is reference is now dangling as the object was if you had foo declared return your call not be accepted by when you pass a temporary object to a you can only take it by const reference or as a this is part of the language	
you have python on linux you probably already use a short python script to do note that we use sets to filter out to be closer to decimal import row in value for key in except for x in for x in key in	
you have set to 1 and or set to 1 or you get b to match baltimore even i think you need to search for to get the happening here is that by thinking sphinx tells sphinx to use an english which allows for words not by to be considered so it puts and in the same you want to get any part of any word then you need to put something like the following in stop and restart once done then searches for should return this	
you have some there is no way to know your problem without any information what so a process crashes it usually has a very good reason to do find out what that your dlls and executables in attach a debugger and make sense of the stack trace you if you get a nonsense stack find out why that with many this one is likely to be solved by debugging	
you have the following class as a network packet char int char int using a class like payload leave the recipient of the data susceptible to alignment issues when receiving the data over a i would think that the class would either need to be reordered or add padding to ensure int int char char add char char int char char int reordering make sense for some i would think adding the padding would be preferred since it would avoid alignment issues even though it would increase the size of the is your experience with such alignment issues in network network packet payload data be aligned on proper	
you have there is an instance each instance of the class gets its own copy of the place to initialize those is in a foo int class variable is one where there is only one copy that is shared by every instance of the those can be initialized as you answer for the integral you also have the option of initializing a static const right in the class foo static const int myint is a single value shared by all instances of the class that cannot be

you know how can i make splint ignore where i declare my know that the old school c tells you to declare variables right at the in every since i am a bad person i like to declare things close to where i use good example is to put int right before the take a very simple splint int return splint and most old c compilers would like to move int up one to put round the declaration and the for now to the how do i turn off this keep the other checks that is i already use gcc as a first line off valgrind as the thinking about adding splint to my list of things that could control my stupidity this check is just gcc warnings i know about the potential portability problems that could come from that bad i feel that it increases aka not needing to jump up and down to search for this type off declarations is more valuable this we can discuss in another little more i put the above code in a file called used is ubuntu and gvim as this is the output from splint when i run 03 nov setting redundant with current parse help on parse see splint this opens up 2 more questions that i did not think about with current what current is it a parse error and not a is a posibility to patch splint to support this have not tried this but yet but i think that it is the can i make splint ignore where i declare my	
you know how long your output strings should string formatting will for to get you need a formatted length of will prepend zeroes if your number the for with the length of target you can use the def l return	
you know how many object be adding very difficult to come up with an optimal all you can do is try to minimize the cost that you know is happening which in this case is that your vector is being constantly could do this in two split your operation into building and this is where you build the list into a vector that is guaranteed to be big enough and when done copy it to another enough for 1000 add when your vector is full call reserve with enough for another set of alloc space for 16 more could choose a different container that did not result in all elements being copied upon a but your bottleneck may then become the individual memory allocations for the new	
you know the maximum depth of then you should be able to simulate the by defining a new macro at each for the 3 level example you that would look something recursion level too	
you learn c consider using these	
you link against you are in the so instead of developing an api for this command line just write a little wrapper that interacts with the program directly on the command you are not and now are just executing a binary your code will not have to be released under the may use exec and friends to do it is a simple solution and depending on how the application expects its input on the command line it can work very well based stuff is harder need a terminal of some the comments it sounds like even this is not and could still cause i suggest contacting a lawyer to make sure you are in the he will be able to interpret the gpl and tell you what you may and may not do with would think that just executing an program and then sending it data piping data into should not cause your program to also be gpl is too if i use a command line tool by executing it and piping data to it my program can still become that is just give me and or mit anytime of way simpler to	
you look at the find it very easy to use and takes a lot of work out of your also does a lot of animation and you can create sequences of animations which you can tie	
you look at the game or simulator industry you find a lot of plus maybe some added scripting there can also be tools written in other languages for scenery design or related but there is only very little lisp used in that you need to be a good hacker to get the necessary performance out of lisp and to be able to access or write the how do you get this fail there is nothing but writing code and experimenting with lisp is really useful for good software engineers or those that have the potential to be a good software of the main obstacles is the either you have a very simple one you have a performance problem with random or you have a sophisticated one you have a problem getting it working only few garbage collectors exist that would be suitable most lisp implementations have good gc but still those are not tuned for or near exceptions do with you can forget the because there usually is other alternative to automatic memory management with a garbage collector is to use no gc and manage memory this is used by some lisp applications that need to support some response example process control expert nearest thing that was developed in that area was the also later game for the playstation i games were for the playstation from naughty since they have been bought by they switched to for the playstation their development environment was written in allegro common lisp and it included a compiler for a scheme lisp on the development system the code gets compiled and then downloaded to the playstation during they had their own 3d engine always got excellent reviews from game incremental level complex behaviour control for lots of different so the playstation was really executing the scheme but memory management was not done via gc they had to develop all the technology on their own nobody was offering tools but they because their were excellent software since then i heard of a similar note that this was not just lisp for scripting it was lisp all the way the scheme side there is also a new interesting implementation called it is developed for a pinball game this could be the base for other the common lisp there have been lisp applications talking to flight simulators and controlling aspects of there are some game libraries that are based on there are interfaces to there is also something like the agent there are also some 3d graphics applications written in common lisp even some complex but in the area of flight simulation there is very little prior the topic of clos functional probably one would use if you need to squeeze all possible performance out of a then clos already has some overheads that one might want to	
you looked at	
you made modifications to the default your web server process one php runs does not have write permission to than you got your registry terminology a bit mixed registry consists of and each value has a name a each key can contain multiple values and there are no that i would suggest refactoring your function like new try return catch echo or log the return	
you mean by smart then that is actually called smart quotes are when you type and but get and or and automatically depending on the not sure how you would use smart quotes in awk or the such as are used to evaluate a command and substitute the result of the command within them into the shell expression being it can be used to compute and argument to another or to set a for less you can instead use which makes a lot of quoting rules easier to work the and are also is used for strings in which you want variable substitution and escape represents a string containing just the characters within the with not variable interpolation or escape for echo echo echo echo echo echo echo scripting such as perl and have similar though there may be slight

you need to upgrade binutils unless you run into some bug fixed in a later binutils or need new features as linker gcc code generation is largely independent of binutils for constructs like which require certain level of support from	
you need to use instead of latter would need an iterator as you use a slightly different loop it current can even overcome the problem mentioned of a logic object during invalidate iterators except of the ones pointing to the removed from i also vote for this being a variation of the singleton and i would suggest for keeping the original solution with a separate management just in case you want to have to have two loops with different delta times or explicit multithread support logic objects on different or whatever in the my opinion this is a general advantage of the singleton class over static methods you could always you can easily multiply your functionality if you want to do so in the future

you probably have access to cron either what i would do is check how much time has passed everytime someone loads a if 24 hours have passed then call your update if 48 hours have passed then call it if no one loads the page then it matter if the update function has been called or not because no one is looking you could setup a computer at home to call your remotely every 24 you can do that with a cron job and wget or if using windows you could use the task think the first option will work the call your update function every page load and only update when the 24 hour mark has if you write it correctly it matter if it gets updated at the exact 24 hour	
you provided the external code a prints then waits for some you type consumes the prints then consumes the newline you go back to the and it all happens your second read anything any prints prints then waits for some you type consumes the only remaining question is why it stops when it to help you with have to see what actually that fairly unusual to call without keeping the result in do you have a reason for doing useful c idiom cast to void is an indication from the programmer that they know discarding the return	
you really want to make sure no duplicates you should just store the the only thing you could do with a hash is use it as an first indicator if the url might but basically your doing the indexing manually while a good db could do this for from how to store there are different ways to represent the same url in a different it might be a good idea to specify how unique you want the urls to

you want the module observed by accessing the file system itself opposed to individual is outside the scope of the c and since lua itself is the exception of the dynamic loader used to implement for c written in standard the core language lacks many file system it is easy to extend the lua core since any platform that has a file system also supports dlls or shared lua file system is a portable library that adds support for directory file attribute and the emulating some of the capability of dir in lua is essentially as simple or name in local fqn local attr produces output that looks directory directory file file your copy of lua came from for then you already have lfs and the above sample will work out of the the lua solution might also be a sensible c or the lua core is not at all provides a and is easy to interact with from c either as a hosting application or as an extension to use lfs from a c you would link with the lua initialize a lua and get the state to execute the either via or by using the c api to retrieve the function from the global push the string and call the lua function with something like which leaves the table on the top of the lua approach probably makes the most sense if you already had a need for an embedded scripting and lua meets your
