200 that probably it should be a 30x status rather than 200 see is best for the response to a and should be a complete absolute your script just says without the 30x cgi servers will usually do an internal redirect by fetching the new url and returning it without telling the browser anything funny this may sound like what you want but it really because from the point of view no different from the original script returning a 200 and direct that would cause a the browser will request url practice probably not as bad as you thanks to the client should be able to respond to the redirect straight away the next as long as on the same there any way that will tell the browser to request when i hit f5 instead of post submission stick with the model for solving

a asp i ventured into webforms world about 5 years after having to handcode things like table in scripting it seemed like webforms would be a tremendous it is until you need even a slight bit of customization beyond alternating row colors and the you could have a gridview running with a few but customizing even what would seem like a simple thing could turn into hours of torture and also think a lot of the examples given in online are oversimplified for the effect of making webforms look sure you can get that gridview to show only 10 records of a record but do you realize that all of the records are being loaded into memory by as an example of the of rectifying that i spent a while creating a pageable gridview that only loads chunks of but it after an hour of i found that you had to delete an extra property that the ide inserts into the not fun when stupid stuff like that sets you at every it even get me started on then the clouds and mvc was handed to now that is a if you are a web you should know whats happening when someone makes a request to your the abstraction and layer of cruft that webforms put on top of that is a the most able to develop applications at the speed of php scripting and finally have total control over the what all as an additional people need to stop complaining that they are creating in mvc views when they find they have to use tags and the drag and drop your gridview onto the set all the then view the crap it gives and your not nearly done now you have to attach events and put more code in your talk about messing up the coding take a simple foreach loop

a proxy server is setup properly to avoid the detection of proxy you be able to proxy servers supply headers as others but those are not present on proxies meant to completely hide the will need to employ several detection such as proxy header and perhaps ip heuristics to detect such check out for some information on this also consider using a proxy blacklist they are published by many nothing is you can employ the above tactics to avoid most simple but at the end of the day merely a series of packets forming a and the protocol was not developed with ideas on in mind that many corporations deploy company wide proxies for various and if you simply block proxies as a general rule you necessarily limit your and that may not always be these proxies usually announce themselves with the appropriate headers you may end up blocking legitimate rather than users who are good at hiding

a series of incoming i want to assign each one to a bucket as it comes the bucket can either be a new one that has never been used of which there are an infinite or it can be an existing if i look at the number of buckets with one the number with the number with i want those bucket counts to follow an exponential i hope saying that correctly if of the buckets have 1 then should have should have in the number of buckets of size k should be as many as the number of buckets of size and the fraction of buckets that are size 1 should be to make the math work out i knew the number of items in it would be know how many buckets of each so i can just pile the the items into as many buckets of each size as i or if i were just generating bucket be easy even if i know the total in each new bucket has probability of being size of being size size size i am processing so as i get an item i need to choose a either an existing or a new if i make a new then i get one more of size but if i choose an existing one of size then i get one more bucket of size and one of size so what should the probability of choosing a bucket of size k be k can be zero to indicate making a new and how does it relate to am doing this to generate test data where i only know the mean number of items per bucket it turns know the number of items in and think that the exponential distribution of bucket sizes is realistic for my probably making it more complicated than it needs to but i was surprised because i thought it would be maybe it but just missing i figure out how to google exponential distribution of bucket

alternative approach to my other have the observer hold a pointer to the model at pass a into the update which is called by the this would need to know what model it is notifying but that probably difficult given that embedded in a so probably always that the observer then needs a model in setmodel you can still give it but more likely is that get rid of setmodel and just call instead of but less you could leave things as they are but declare then you can use amodel as a model in but no other method of the observer can modify the of these changes will work if the observer is expected to be able to unregister itself without a parameter to use to do	
alternative style is to allow the dtos referenced by the proxyy classes to not be the same as the dtos returned from the this may sound but this is the way it would be if yhour client were written in for the client would only see proxy versions of the service interfaces and proxy versions of the dto classess referred to in the service reduces coupling across the service

am building a using the where the server is sending an image to the client through a socket every was using but besides the overhead of this sometimes the client ended up with more than one image on the and i still though of a clever mechanism to split the bytes of each image i just need the most recent tried using but got to the conclusion that i send 100kb only 64kb and even i use more than otherwise the packet would be divided along the network and the chances of losing parts of the packet would be now a bit should i continue using tcp and put some escaping bytes in the end of each image so the client can separate or should i use send dgrams of 1500 bytes and come up with a mechanism for ordering and key goal here is transmitting the images very i mind losing some on the way as long as the client keeps receiving newer should i use another thanks in send an image every 50 should i use tcp or

another language will make you a better especially when the paradigm is significantly different from any other language you already c will give you a much better grasp of what you are actually it will be like being accustomed to a full featured graphing calculator and then learning to do all the and graphing yourself with just a blackboard and it will be a lot of but if you your mental model of the code will be much closer to what is actually happening in the really necessary to be a good i believe one of the characteristics of a good coder is the ability to understand the code in a higher level of and to see the system as a low level knowledge help you with the big if you want to be you have to move beyond just you should be able to understand the system at many different levels of abstraction from the upper conceptual diagram level down to the bare machine code knowing c will help you with understanding the low being able to debug c will help you with troubleshooting at all allows you to do the low level operations of but adds a bunch of abstraction mechanisms and code reuse facilities so you can be a little more if you already know a higher level language like and so i would recommend that you make some effort to become skilled in c and not try to tackle just the purpose of learning another language should be to expand your that even if you end up using it in a professional or hobbyist you will still improve your coding and analysis skills for the languages that you do

answer is but as you are about to create your first i just wanted to add that is not at all a recommended method of accessing the repository in a production in according to the it should not really be regarded as an option at not be seduced by the simple of having all of your users access repository directly via even if the repository is available to everyone via a this is a bad it any layers of protection between users and the users accidentally corrupt the repository becomes hard to take the offline for inspection or it can lead to a mess of permission problems the called multiple access note that this also one of the reasons we against accessing repositories a effectively the as local users accessing via and it can entail all the problems if the administrator is almost always better then access and it really is almost no additional effort to set

answer is ultimately correct rewrite your app to launch sometimes not a practical for example loading code later in the application may take too long a data acquisition forcing it to be loaded at if you decide that you want to show a splash the easiest way is to show it in the application create a splash window in your applications and add an outlet to your app delegate referencing that you can then put the window onscreen in and hide it in note that the main nsrunloop is not iterating during this so if you want to update the splash screen a progress or need to manage those redraw events think very hard about whether the long startup is if it showing a splash screen a progess is the minimum that you owe your

anything you have to understand that everything about parsing is based on describe the language you want to implement in terms of how to decompose the text in basic units and how to stack those units in some meaning ful you may also want to look for the between ll and lr can be of two implementation and grammar writing if you use a standard tool you only need to understand the second usually use ll they are simpler to write and to implement even using custom grammars theoretically cover more kinds of languages but in a normal situation they are just a hindrance when you need some correct error random gnu version of the venerable

are a number of spring but the initial spring project came about because of the perceived difficulties of working with find a number of projects on the springsource website that have grown out of but rather than being lumped into one framework taken a more modular for all the products they produce can someone please tell me how they have used spring to produce provides a number of but the most oft used one is that of dependency this allows you to wire together components by declaring the relationships in the spring container then reads this information and constructs the bean hierarchy at a standard way to describe the beans in xml is the application can someone please point to me some real world applications done in spring iread somewhere is done with are lots of applications built using not sure of big commercial but i expect there to be can someone please tell me how this pieces come together etc and of course to produce an is normally integrated with other there are various hooks into these frameworks and you need to look at each one separately in order to understand what they are all struts and spring framework integration can be found more about how you configure your application in relation to spring rather than the application see how many separate pieces of software do you need to produce an application using a web application would consist of spring mvc spring a desktop application java swing spring in terms of the spring framework itself with it would your standard javabean classes class examplebean anotherbean yetanotherbean int anotherbean yetanotherbean int beans within your application context spring with your web via are taken from the spring docs how easy is it to produce application using spring but again dependent on what if just using the spring pojo framework to build a service and integration tier then fairly if you have to build a web application then a little more complicated hugely at to understand the that

are controls look at the inheritance and a form itself have a whole lot of overhead in and of it creates a native but about should drive your decision is how you use and display your ui elements in your forms are conducive to many ui and what most developers are familiar the designer supports them and hiding and closing forms is a well often used paradigm that works just you have the load penalty whenever a form is created as it creates all of its contained but going to pay that even if a the child controls have to be created in either might argue that forms require that you recreate them every but not if you use showdialog or hide instead of you can reuse your forms and pay the price the advantage here is that the form holds your controls in teh collection and manages all of that for so you have little to worry about with the gc and remembering what roots you have usercontrol paradigm is more complex you have to manage loading and unloading controls yourself to keep memory pressure complexity also increases cost cost to cost to and likely cost to however there are some clear advantages to usercontrols in some scenarios if you use an pattern and some form of framework that handlesyour a usercontrol makes a really good view with the form becoming the workspace for the is a classic example of and so is the for the which is it depends on how and where using the how your team is already doing and how architected the solution plugging in in the is no one right

are other methods that been developed since mvc namely model view at martin website is a good overview of these own application uses a passive view as it allows us to rip off a ui and substitute another this an advantage for us as our software is a application meant to be used with a varity of metal cutting forms are thin shells which call a ui the forms implement a interface and itself with the ui we have a variety of forms used for different for example a setup form where the user modifies the extensive setup parameters for the machine he a shape entry a metal cutting form where the user positions the shapes to be all of this forms have a distinct the metal cutting form is different between different type of one may show a wysiwyg view of a flat plate of another is a spreadsheet style grid of the parts to be cut in the order they will be another yet shows the parts positioned on a rotating ui layer in turns takes the incoming input and executes the commands in turn interact with both the ui and nearly everything is handled through command objects as opposed to direct calls through structure allows a variety of uis to be connected to the same within a specific ui a variety of views can be what i have marked as model could be separate they would only be combined at the ui interface layer and above through the ui components referencing the different hierarchy looks like implement form implement ui inferaces with forms through interacts with the mode ui through the ui

are some reasons related to schedule and resources of implementation of properties and understanding all of the ramifications and intersections with other language features is a large task similar to the size of various java 5 language i think the real reason sun is not pushing properties is the same as there is no consensus on what the implementation should look or there are many competing alternatives and people who are passionate about properties disagree about crucial parts of the perhaps more there is a significant lack of consensus about whether the feature is wanted at while many people want there are also many people that think necessary or useful i think people see properties as far less crucial to their daily life than swing history

bug was a major issue for my worked around it a long time ago by using a conditional rule in an file that would disable all caching of images on the site for firefox this was a horrible thing to need to but at the time i track down the bug within firefox and having the site be slightly slower is better than showing i read in the linked bug that it was fixed in the latest firefox i changed the conditional on april 19th 2009 to only disable caching for firefox 2 few hours later received over 10 from firefox 3 users that they were seeing duplicate so this issue is still a problem in firefox decided to create a simple linux test program that would allow me to check to see if they are generating the same cache hash compile in any linux ffgenhash is the code to file long char unsigned long unsigned char s char h return char return you can here are two real life that generate the same cache hash i these images in a javascript trying to use some sort of empty tag workaround is not possible i think my only real solution is to modify the for firefox users in some way to generate a unique cache hash so the approach the half tempted to create a firebug addition that will check all resources loaded by a site and give a big error if two resources on the site share a common hash key so the developer is it would be great to run sites like google maps through this as seen weird things with those images over the past few years

do most of my work with microsoft technologies these so naturally checking out what wcf has to it seems very flexible and a great next step up from but it seems very tied to soap messages and quite a bit clunky for a platform agnostic web service not an expert on the but i imagine all of this flexibility touting means that you can break away from soap messages and return whatever data you is this true or reason i say this is that if i really wanted to create an application as a rest one of my target platforms would be not just one important goal of any web based service is to keep the data payload small whether for a mobile at dial up speeds or a full desktop if you take api as an it has been incredibly successful because you can request the data as json with no fancy soap envelopes weighing the data down and receive the smallest amount of bytes to represent the data you so a mobile application running on a device with poor connectivity consuming data can use the least amount of bandwidth besides the pattern of or any of the more successful public is a custom data structure in json xml and not wrapped in a soap envelope i could be is just my would you do this in do you have to jump through hoops to tell wcf to return this worry about the soap or is it a simple config as a web service with the smallest possible

faced a similar problem on a we solved it by first creating a simple table that only has one a bigint set as we created an sproc that inserts a new row in that using default values and inside a it then stores the in a rolls back the transaction and then returns the stored gives us a unique id inside the database without filling up a you want to know what kind of object the id is referring lose the transaction rollback and also store the type of object along side the that way findout out what kind of object the id is referring to is only one select inner

fairly sure have to implement your own assuming a solution already as far as how your logic should all you need to implement is collision i tell you specifically how this will work in your as that will depend on several variables the hotspots fixed are they laid out in a symmetrical grid if all laid out in a symmetrical you should be able to use mathematical functions to turn a given pair into a particular if of varying sizes and then probably have to search through your collection of hotspot rectanges at least a subset of that to find the rectangle that contains your

fastest loaded resource is always the resource that need to be loaded at apart from shrinking your images to reasonable sizes you should read about http should instruct your web server to deliver the responses with proper caching informations so that user agents may reuse local cached nottingham wrote a about http a good starting is a about apache configuration on http	
fastest solution to this is to find the and then use that byte in a lookup this gives you a performance of four conditional instructions and a of not only is this the least amount of but the least amount of branches which is on modern table should contain the index of the lsb for each number in the range you check each byte of your value and find the lowest then use this value to lookup the real does require of but if the speed of this function is so important then that is well worth left as an exercise for the reader to note that order to check indices will depend whether you are on a big or little endian this is for bytes if return else if return else if return return

favorite way to solve this problem is to the portion of the input that exceeds the maximum this provides a visual cue as to which part makes it without having to get into the specifics of how many bytes or characters it you can use javascript if you need to meet 508 i also like monitoring the length of the field and alerting the user when too long still doing of you want to get into complex css inside the input you can just reproduce the bad input below the field and highlight it	
feel that the mvc pattern as a framework for data driving web applications does seems to require less verbosity and hence less code with dynamic languages like python and which is a good languages make it easy to avoid the dependency between the v and c which is one of the purposes of the for example in python you can just pass your model objects to the view without the view requiring a dependency on the model it just cares that any type with the same attributes is passed once you start using a templating language in the like in it even cause script errors when an attribute avoid these dependency in a strongly typed you often start passing passing around dictionaries with literal strings as meaning most of the benefits of strongly type languages are lost your compiler tell you named a key and then attempt to find it with a key this will be discovered at given the mvc pattern lends itself to testing by allowing the v and c to be tested there is less advantage using strongly typed compiled language as tests can be used to validate your application is working as it should

found to the question on jguru written by terence who created i copied this explanation from the site linked syntax directed translations can be done with actions within the these kinds of translations can only spit out constructs that are functions of information already seen at that point in the tree parsers allow you to walk an intermediate form and manipulate that gradually morphing it over several translation phases to a final form that can be easily printed back out as the new a simple translation problem where you want to print out an html page whose title is are n where n is the number of identifiers you found in the input the ids must be printed after the title like are 3 with simple actions in your grammar how can you compute the you without reading the whole so now we know we need an intermediate the best is usually an ast found since it records the input in this just a list but it demonstrates my now you know that a tree is a good thing for anything but simple given an how do you get output from imagine simple expression one way is to make the nodes in the tree specific classes like integernode and so then you just ask each node to print itself for you would have plusnode extends commonast public string ast left ast right return left intnode extends commonast public string return an expression you can translate it back to text with wrong with seems to work it appears to work well in this case because but i argue even for this simple tree grammars are more readable and are formalized descriptions of precisely what you coded in the returns string that the specific class approach actually encodes a complete parser for int by hand in as parser generator this should make you main weakness of the heterogeneous ast approach is that it cannot conveniently access context in a your context is easily accessed because it can be passed in as a you also know precisely which rule can invoke which other rule is this expression a while condition or an if by looking at the the plusnode class above exists in a isolated world where it has no idea who will invoke the programmer cannot tell in which context it will be invoked by reading adding actions to your input parser works for very straightforward translations order of output constructs is the same as the input constructs can be generated from information parsed up to the point when you need to spit them out you will need an intermediate ast is the best form using a grammar to describe the structure of the ast is analogous to using a grammar to parse your input formalized descriptions in a language like antlr are better than hand coded actions within a tree grammar have very clear context and can conveniently access information passed from invoking translations that manipulate the tree for multipass translations are also much easier using a tree

generally use an output parameter and define the possible integer an insert new row id integer known possible error missing zero missing zero becomes a bit tedious to define but it can be extensible and it is a way to get meaningful results back to your clients and for a data access layer to pass back to a business objects layer an exact reason for failure use enums in the business objects layer for different status is also possible for a data access layer to throw exceptions if desired but i believe from a performance perspective you are better off not throwing errors when you could just check an enum or integer are other techniques this is just one that i have used with some measure of success in the

hardware requirements will somewhat depend on what kind of reliability you want for this if using this to run recommend having at least two machines you split the vms and if using n servers you should be able to get by on of them for the time it takes your vendor to replace the bad the 2 if you want higher reliability less then a san of some kind to store the data on is going to be required the live migration stuff seen is if you can live with the method down both move drives from server1 to power up reconfigure vms to use less memory and start then you really need the san the end of the your biggest sizing will be hd and your hd footprint will be relatively fixed least in most kinds of a and your ram footprint should be relatively fixed as well extra here is always cpu is usually one thing you can skimp on a little bit if you have so long as willing to wait for builds and the other nice thing about going all virtualized is that you can start with a pair of big servers and grow out as your needs need to give your dev environment more get another server and split the vms need to simulate a lower the memory usage of the existing node and spin up 3 this unless i needed very performance i need to consider clustering physical servers for performance go with a virtualized with the extensions on modern cpus and support for the hit is not that big if done

have a application with stories and categories i know that when you save a new instance of a model with a problems come up because the object is not yet in the this problem usually manifests itself on form which can be neatly worked around with what about a situation where there are no forms to speak in my i want to build an api to accept remote since i like and a whole lot of other messaging in our company is in json outgoing messages from this like to be able to receive the implement a factory that converts the values to but like the factory to be as agnostic as possible to the type of also be converted in the same except that insert ignores id and update gets the already existing instance and overrides remote submitter listens to a feed that gives among other the category objects to so it and refer to them by but it have any direct communication with the real question the most easiest consistent to inflate an instance of a django model object that has a manytomanymanager as far as i can any insert of an object with a field will require two database just because it is necessary to obtain a new id but my current awkward solution is to save the object right away and mark it so that functions down the line can play with it and save it as something a little more it seems like one step up would be overriding so that objects without ids save copy some proxy field to then save best of all would be some robust manager object that saves me the what do you object with manytomany in

have some code with various error error handlers in a few places to handle some broken third party i was getting an overflow error from the err in a routine that have an error trap but is called by a routine that i always thought error traps were only valid in the routine they were but it looks like an error in a subroutine can cause it to go to the calling error i turned off the calling error trap and found my overflow and all is but before i did i spent some time trying to find a programatic way to get vb to return to its default error handling inside that routine i have to modify outside code to but i the only error commands i could on error goto on error resume on error goto on error goto turn on the manual error handling is there a way to turn it off to the vb6 to the default error handling in

hit the nail on the head you want your as modeled using a state to be decoupled from your domain your domain entities probably have direct knowledge that they are being used in a state which will manage the job of transitioning them from state to state based upon certain but they understanding the business meaning of each state they are and be able to enforce or apply business rules related to those your domain entities that are appropriate for being managed by a state machine will have some kind of status that acts as a state for the state and will raise events which can be used by the state machine to determine when a transition is if it is indeed true that your states are sequential they always go or backwards and forwards exactly one not sure a state machine does make sense because there is no special context needed to choose the next state you can only go backwards or so any ordered list of states as an coupled with logic should suffice but real world processes are rarely that strictly even though they may appear to be at first

i believe the misinformation strings being immutable have nothing with if someone already has access to the objects in a running application would have to be assumed if you are trying to guard against someone a string in your they would certainly be a plenty of other opportunities available for a quite novel idea that the immutability of string is addressing threading hmmm i have an object that is being changed by two different how do i resolve synchronize access to the naawww not let anyone change the object at all fix all of our messy concurrency in make all objects and then we can removed the synchonized contruct from the java real reason out by others is memory it is quite common in any application for the same string literal to be used it is so in that decades many compilers made the optimization of storing only a single instance of a string the drawback of this optimization is that runtime code that modifies a string literal introduces a problem because it is modifying the instance for all other code that shares for it would be not good for a function somewhere in an application to change the string literal to a would result in being written to for that there needed to be a way of guarding against code that attempts to change string literals make them some compilers support from the would accomplish this by placing string literal into a special readonly memory segment that would cause a memory fault if a write attempt was java this is known as the java compiler here is just following an standard memory optimization done by compilers for and to address the same issue of these string literals being modified at java simply makes the string class immutable gives you no setters that would allow you to change the string strings would not have to be immutable if interning of string literals did not

implementing a specialized memcache server for a certain storage backend would be more memory efficient and lookup time could be decreased by bit wise lookup operations wrote all the protocol implementation and event driven daemon part with python within 2 giving us enough time to test on functionality and focusing on performance while team was validating protocol conformance and other the the tools like implementing c extensions for python is next to trivial for any developer a bit experienced in i rewrote the based storage backend in c and made it a python module with pyrex within a memory usage for 475k prefixes went down from 90mb to we got a jump in the query this application is running with interface for and the new storage backend handles 8000 queries per second on a modest single core running as a process to consuming less than 40mb of memory the python while handling simultaneous a project designed and implemented to production quality in less than 5 without python and it would take could have troubleshoot the performance problem by just using more powerful servers and switch to a model while complicating the code and administration accompanied with much larger memory think on the right track to go with	
important difference between and is not will only accept a string but will accept if the operand is an it will be converted to a string by calling on a primitive will be converted as if by calling the appropriate method in the associated wrapper and a null reference becomes the string i know why even people see it listed in the api docs and assume there for a good being the most obvious but a red if performance is really a you should be using a as discussed in the thread john linked or is much more as for the issue of objects in the string i think misunderstanding what the string pool at the actual character and will be stored in a dedicated data and wherever you see the literals and in the source the bytecode will really contain references to the appropriate entries in that data the string pool is populated when the classes are not when the code containing the string literals is that means each of your snippets only creates one the result of the also some object creation behind the which is a little different for each of the but the performance impact is not worth worrying

in this i would consider treating the status than as a primary and have the denormalized in the this retains the foreign but reduces the number of joins and navigations it also allows you potentially to map the code to an in your would probably use a lazy cache of the i18n text the query object tracking the number of that are happening you to program just against an enum in the object but display the i18n the i18n implementation you could switch to resx or similar if you needed or an automated translation you to obtain i18n values without being tied to an existing data query to populate a box for a search screen has nothing to do with individual so the example query guessing the i18n data is slow so the cache approach is would load all the strings a language at a time so the first time a status is needed in welsh load the status strings for and cache against the standard code for the make the view code consider using an extension method on the employee the ui static class employeeextensions public static string employee do your funky presumably using the httpcontext some other value to resolve the current culture in your view you can unfortunately there are no extension but with a method you also have the option of passing the into the method adding a

input text often has characters which are incorrect for the output things like which come from a document in 147 and 148 in are perfectly valid unicode and your application should be capable of handling them if doing something wrong and most likely all characters will of whether the characters came from someone typing them or someone pasting them in from the browser should be submitting characters to your which should be storing the same bytes to the the browser is not submitting in chances are failing to set the charset of the html page containing the this can be done using header in i just set the attribute on the form and have the browser do it for is basically useless thanks to which misinterprets it to mean using this charset if the one on the page encode the characters we instead of use this this means if you use you can end up with a mixture of encodings submitted at with no way to figure out which is come my database is accepting these which are characters in mysql is just a used for comparison and still storing the data as bytes and really care if not valid a good idea to decode and check incoming sequences in your app because invalid in modern can hide a character that will still be recognised by older browsers least ie6 opera i entered a string containing byte you entered a unicode character the browser deals with unicode not right up until the point it has to submit the serialised form to the then that it decides how to turn the characters into and if the page is being handled as it will always choose not browsers tend to cheat in a for all characters that fit in the encode them to html character references like this is wrong because you now tell the difference between a and a and insidiously wrong because if you then echo the reference as unescaped html it looks like getting it which in fact just made a big old security went into the database as a not or came out when i produced the as no complaints from the it did not come out as a single a browser will complain when given a bare in an xml an html in which invalid sequences come out as a suspect it is coming out as a character which is the character is part of the c1 control so render as anything if this is your form page is not being picked up as after and suffering the problem described

is fairly just had a quick read on design from what i can by effectively branching the files individually into an arbitrary going to be heading for a world of pain when you start to merge things back to their original location the merge probably be done in a single commit across all the i think you can do a similar thing to design parts in subversion with a bit of a design part can be simulated using externals allows externals to point to files as well as do you could setup your project heirarchy like parts folder would only contain an property which brings in the appropriate files for that part into the appropriate then checkout the rather than and you get a working copy that contains just the files you want in the structure that the part and when you going straight into trunk no merging required can also baseline your parts by first branching the entirety of trunk and and then changing your part externals to point to the branch instead of the main this increase the size of the and your working copy keeps exactly the same just sourcing all your files from the branch rather than any updates to that part also goes against the branch merging the changes of the part is just a bog standard merge of the branch back into which is standard svn the definition of parts gets more since in the scheme each part is defined manually and not need some form of script that knows the parts hierarchy and given a part can build the appropriate externals definitions which can then be applied to a parts while subversion explicitly provide the abstraction layer of it can be modeled manually fairly accurately only limited by the capabilities of and the scripts which you use to manage

is not a real answer to you but probably a solution to solve the use an implementation of sql lite for my integration i build up the schema and fill the database before each the schema creation and initial data filling happens really fast then seconds per because an do you use a physical response to answer about question because i migrated my schema and data directly from sql server 2005 and i want it to persist in source recommend to store a file with the database schema in and a file or script that creates the sample data in source you can generate the file using sql server studion management you can generate it from your nhibernate mappings or you can use a tool like sql compare and you can probably find other solutions for this when you need plain text files are stored easier in version control systems then complete binary database does something about the sqlite engine differ such that it would resolve this might solve your problems because you can recreate your database before each your database under test will be in a the state you expect it to be before each test is a benefit of that is there is no need to roll back your but i have run similar test with in memory sqllite and it worked as

is quite easy to know the web method is called asmx of the file 4guysfromrolla about they have a technology makes you expose methods as a web service so you can connect it the from everywhere and use it the data between server and you can send big files in a clear you can protect the access to the web service using but it is a pain and quite normally in asmx we use username passsword to give access to a method in plain you are in the different world about web and this is the best technology in to expose services you see the not wcf does not need iis to it can run as a system service on the using a console ambient command in so we say that wcf is a not a web remember asmx need iis to run and will only run hosted in a web wcf you can use ssl to encrypt the communication do that in asmx you need to use web services and it is quite easy to implement you can send big files and securely do that in asmx you need to use message transmission optimization can set the transmission preferences just changing one line of or if you change the xml configuration the security is much etc you get a better general overview with but there is much to expose web services that you do not need to you can use no problem at but if you need to protect the communication do it in can read here some performance comparative between the 2

more like you want to use powershell you can spawn new windows other by using see also although you probably have to use some other tools and a little trickery to create something like a have only a maximum of instances running at a you could achieve the latter by using and counting how many are already there loop or if and simply wait 2 and again whether you can spawn a new have cobbled together a little test batch for in do call lss 5 rem just a dummy program that waits instead of doing useful rem but suffices for echo starting processing instance for start 5 goto wait a can be adjusted with 2 because the first ping returns otherwise just use an address unused and waiting for instances to close 2 jump back to see whether we can spawn a new process this could probably be done but instances should contain the number of running instances in csv eq do set spawns a maximum of four new processes that execute in parallel and wait time needs to be adjusted depending on how much each process does and how long it is you probably also need to adjust the process name for which tasklist is looking if doing something is no way to properly count the processes that are spawned by this one way would be to create a random number at the start of the batch and create a helper batch that does the processing spawns the processing but which can set its window title to a would be a simple batch that sets its title to the first parameter and then runs the second parameter with the third as you can then filter in tasklist by selecting only processes with the specified window title eq this should work fairly reliable and prevents too many false searching for would be a bad idea if you still have some instances as that limits your pool of worker can use to create a sensible default of how many instances to can also easily adapt this to use to spawn the processes remotely be very viable as you have to have admin privileges on the other machine as well as provide the password in the you would have to use process names for filtering

most cases connection pooling problems are related to your application probably close its database connections correctly and when you leave connections they remain blocked until the garbage collector closes them for you by calling their want to make sure that you are closing the for example the following code will cause a connection if the code between and throws an myconnection new some correct way would be myconnection new somecall myconnection new your function a connection from a class make sure you cache it locally and call its leak a connection using this code for new connection returned from the first call to is not being instead of closing your this line creates a new one and tries to close you use sqldatareader or a close even though closing the connection itself seems to do the put in the extra effort to close your data reader objects explicitly when you use article does a connection pool from magazine explains a lot of details and suggests some debugging or these system stored procedures return information from the system table that shows the status of and information about all working see one server process id per if you named your connection by using the application name argument in the connection your working connections will be easy to sql server profiler with the sqlprofiler template to trace open if familiar with this method is easier than polling by using the performance monitor to monitor the pools and i discuss this method in a performance counters in you can monitor the health of your connection pool and the number of established connections by using routines to extract the counters or by using the new performancecounter

nfs you face some problems with client side caching and stale i have written an os independent lock module to work over nfs the simple idea of creating a file does not work well over the basic idea to work around it is to create a lock file which if present means file is not locked and a process that wants to acquire a lock renames the file to a different name like the rename is an atomic enough operation that works well enough over nfs to guarantee exclusivity of the the rest is basically a bunch of fail error checking and lock retrieval in case the process dies before releasing the lock and renaming the lock file back to

not a huge fan of this we have some software that essentially does this for some calling what they table with column definitions call it this table contains columns like and instance master table just and for each packet type instance definition table this would be this table collects the columns together to form the data structure that for it might hold in this is a since it maps the columns to the packets that use a second database of dynamic implications of this tables are created dynamically to hold the actual for if defined steps a packet type called you might have a table called in your database to hold that use linked to to figure out what field types to create and how big they should you end up with a collection of tables that match the packet type definitions from step using the columns from step i particular like the implications of step creating tables dynamically can lead to some consequences if security designed properly and the input from any fields in your application cleansed especially if this application has an interface that available to untrusted callers the you can create indexes however you want when the tables are created you have a column in step 1 where you flag certain columns as and indexes are created on top of them when the tables are

of the most common mantras in computer science and programming is to never optimize meaning that you should not optimize anything until a problem has been since code is likely to sometimes you might know that a particular way of doing things will perform when is it ok to optimize before identifying a what sorts of optimizations are allowable right from the using as few db connections as and paying close attention to that while rather than using a new connection as needed and worrying about the performance cost optimizations are ok to do right

only end up with five items if returns thats the simple answer to your but i see other problems wondering why you have this is that array the same thing as you really need to be using the same array for both not a syntax but you use the property syntax for things that declared as you should write also confused by the code you use to set up the cells are meant to be that you create one then reconfigure it every time in your implementation of your code creates a cell for each item in your this is very and will likely crash your program due to insufficient memory on the iphone if you keep lots of cells in memory like recommended approach is to call if that returns then you set up a cell using the the table view is very and will only ask you to redraw the cell when it needs you dictionary looks really shaky to what if you insert an item after the item with key all the items with key onward will need to be shifted one element to the right to work the way you a ton of bookkeeping that seems rather unnecessary to if you really needed something like this and to be i think you do why you use an which is much easier to

pointers are a poor attempt to be you could even make an argument that having function pointers makes a language since you can write higher order functions with closures and easy sorta so you tend to use them far less than mainly for oo design works around using functions by instead creating a whole interface type to pass in the function has so function pointers actually store an object so not just a raw but typed state are vastly more usable of the comments said there should be a demonstration of higher order functions with function any function taking a callback function is a higher order wndenumproc lparam parameter is the function to pass easy but since there are no closures in we get this lovely second an value to be passed to the callback that value allows you to manually pass around untyped state to compensate for lack of framework is also filled with similar for a object that qualifies or contains information about an asynchronous since the iar is all you get on your without you need a way to shove some data into the async op so you can cast it out

question contains several separate questions start servletcontext is good place where you can store handle to your but you pay by having cache per server it should be no if you want to register cache in wider range consider registering it into problem with you are retrieving xml via if you are accesing this webservice via http you can install simple http proxy server on your side which handle caching of the next step will be caching of resolved xml in some sort of local object this cache can exists per server without any in this second case the ehcache will do perfect in this case the chain of processing will be like this http request servlet look into local cache if not cached look into http proxy do proxy job to cache per server which contains only objects from requested http proxy running on same hardware as our to scale webapp without adding new http proxies for xml level of point of failure complicated forget to always send http head request into proxy to ensure that cache is up to

question for today thanks for your input on the previous already searched the forum on this and nothing quite answers this use some 3rd party libraries which pop work onto the threadpool and we want to shutdown while there are outstanding shutting down an the application will shutdown even if there is work outstanding in the because these threads are back ground than doing some form of reference counting enforcing every item queued into the pool to use this which we have control is there some way to stop the application shutting down while there is outstanding work to be looked at using the vs but these can be the same because we may have caught the threadpool as a thread was freed up but not allocated a queued help there any way to stop an application shutting down with work still in the system	
question is a good but not do you just need to pass an array of strings or does the class you are passing to need to modify the not a problem to simply pass around an however you need to be because you are just passing a pointer so if you retain it you need to be aware that the owner or some other class may modify the array spoken you would want to use nsmutablearray to dynamically build up an array of objects and when you need to share then make a copy and pass that myarr maybe modify the array nonmut

question is poorly phrased at least the title because it implies this difference is endemic and holds true for all instances of the body of the question is better phrased because it presents a reasonably detailed explanation of the sort of thing your code is it state what versions of runtimes you are nor does it state the target architecture or machine the code will run these things make big have done some this is some as to why you see the results you as good at writing performant code as you are at is not a or even likely but it is a real possibility you should versions of the jvm have some serious optimizations to make uncontended locks extremely this may skew things in your favour especially the comparison with the c implementation threading primitives you are the java code seems to run well compared to the c code it is likely that you are not terribly dependent on the heap allocation strategy would tell you the code runs less well than the java one assuming the code is then several possible reasons are using virtual functions which the jvm will inline but the clr will latest jvm does which may make some code paths considerably more efficient those involving string manipulation whose lifetime is stack the very latest 32 bit clr will inline methods involving non primitive jvm jit compilers use hotspot style mechanisms which attempt to detect the of the code and spend more effort an understanding of what your code spends most of its time doing it is impossible to make specific i can quite easily write code which performs much better under the clr due to use of structs over objects or by targeting runtime specific features of the clr like non boxed this is hardly instructive as a general

ran across some of these issues at work really have a chance to explore it there my issues should an application designer take into consideration when devising the error and exception handling ideal exception handling strategy would be a complete recovery and logging of the the if you could do such a you have written it in the code in the first as not really an per plus your implementation complexity goes the other side of this would be in the realm of autonomic systems and the i believe the most realistic strategy is to always try and force the system into a consistent state minimal you will always be forced to something loss or corrupted loss of resources resulting in reduced being in a consistent state increases your chance of staying operational at a diminished capacity rather than face a total formalizing a consistent state among the project team could mean establishing natural default values which would be used as a reset the strategy will differ depending on the software type business hosted web embedded is the software type think each type of software lends itself to different auditing and qos and it is reflected in the costs associated with downtime and or data the general strategy is the with the strategy is to minimize the appearance of the problem to the user and create you can achieve this by restarting the software quietly reset the with hosted web the session data from a crash can be dumped for later analysis and the user gets a new for a game for things like you invest in maintaining snapshot data to prevent gamers from losing progress in the event of a server server clustering and techniques are also very important in these political and legal is probably the most important part of error and exception which would come in the form of maintaining the end result of those issues is demonstrating the system failure any collateral damage is a result of an unpredictable chain of events which cannot be reasonably foreseen by the also important to demonstrate that whatever handling mechanisms in place had a positive effect by reducing keeping users in the loop in the face of a catastrophic failure is also important did my wow server but my main point is that transparency should be applied to disciplined auditing for the purposes of reconstructing the perspectives on error handling business a error handling should be totally if a server i still want my bank transaction to be completed as scheduled without having to call the bank and rerunning the a error handling is the most difficult part of the application to the number of things which can go resulting from both people and technology and how to classify them into cases which we can write code to handle is immensely we depend on the project budget and management to guide these but in the still like playing a game of russian business support i suppose error handling would be like the insurance paid during the software development phases which reduce the incidences of having to compensate customers who experience inconveniences or outages due to software also a measure of software quality and accountability they want to know which division group developer was

recommend that you consider the approach known as vertical this means that you keep defining tables with a userid you could call them start a new table when you hit the maximum row size for your the benefit of this approach is that the values are still true database this will wind up saving time when working with this data key question to answer are these really do they represent the struture of information that you must collect about the if the best way to model them is to make them the only reason you must resort to vertical partitioning is the row size limit of the on the other a flexible attribute system is called then by all means go with the property value for if users were allowed to define their own attributes then definitely want the i would say is not the best way if you understand the structure of your data and have legitimately identified hundreds of attributes for a side i must say that you should question entities with large numbers of they may be but also quite likely that missing some entities at the conceptual in other mabe all of these attributes related to the user per but to some other entity that is related to

recommendation to start with xsd is a good that will not guarantee compatibility on each as xml schema is really big and no web services stack supports all of start with but confine yourself to mainstream complextypes composed of arrays of you can safely nest complextypes and of complextypes that contain arrays or away from substitution and any other xsd even xsd enumerations should be not enough to use a nullable there are formatting concerns as the datetime is a higher resolution quantity than a java calendar and as a shipping a time to java can result in exceptions on the java using the decorator in the xmlelement attribute on the side can make sure you serialize old on it is not true that you cannot use xml doc on the classes that get with partial you can write separate code from the generated classes with the doc you even if you the your partial class code will remain when you the doc will appear on the someone if using is not enough to guarantee why use my it is not a guarantee but it is a good it it keeps you away from designing interfaces in code java or or that expose things like generic java all of which present interop there are still pitfalls in the more marginal parts of but you can usually avoid those with thoughtful should have mentioned in my original answer that you can apply an iterative process to the development of the design in then generate stub and skeleton code from the then adjust and do it

remember that you are creating a model of game that does not depend on the details of any operating your game depends on state management and algorithms which depend on the the key is to write your game logic without dependencies to specific libraries which means a lot of call directly you should write an or macro that can be changed based on the use dword when you can use a class or typedef that can be tailored to different instance if you where making a football then algorithms for throwing the positions of the players could be done completely in standard without platform if your encapsulation was good you could dump the state of you game to a file and display it separately with a rendering

running into a situation where i need the atomic sum of two values in the code i inherited goes like a b individual reads of a and b are and all writes elsewhere in the code to these two memory locations are also lockless however the problem is that the values of the two locations can and do change between the two how do i make this operation i know all about but it tends to only involve making operations atomic and not quite what i want to do there a way to do or is the best option to refactor the code so that i only need to check one i mention that i wanted to do this locklessly in the first but some people picked up on it after my second i know no one believes people when they say things like but i use locks have to emulate a mutex with atomics and be more work than refactoring the code to keep track of one value instead of now my method of investigation involves taking advantage of the fact that the values are consecutive and grabbing them atomically with a 64 bit which assured are atomic on my target if anyone has new please there a way i can make two reads

say i have a system that stores data for some complex objects in these objects have a weak inheritance maybe 4 fields common to all of them and then another 20 that are unique to each type of say 6 to 8 different types of data that is unique to each object may itself be things like other complex and items that are only used each type of object has an xml schema to describe system builds up a record for each object over a series of and so it will be very common to have only a partial what goes into each step is not a user may fill in as much as they know and then pass it up the chain for someone more knowledgeable to i want to do is create an page to show these given a record number load the schema for that type into a and then populate the form from the record i think the record by itself will be enough to create the because the record may not yet list each field i want to include on the form and implicitly include data for types like would be an elegant way to accomplish sure missing something obvious about a simple way to do but xslt probably cut is a follow up to and at the moment is purely based on responses here i may go a different way page based on xml schema and add data from xml

see anything in your requirement that says a user needs to know what a url if you implement this you are implying you may end up with things like or if you then wanted to change the way urls were have to change all the it would be preferable to have all objects in your system have an id and a view helper class which has a method such you absolutely need to do is isolate objects in your model from the plumbing of how they are located and leave the locating up to the web framework you are a general best practise is that every class specifies an id and a handler in your web infrastructure depends upon the class it it retrieves the class by an id passed to you see the dependency is one the view class depends upon the underlying but the model does not depend upon how it if you subsequently want caching of you can implement this at the view again the underlying object has no knowledge or dependency on whether it is being

server only stores time to approximately of a these always fall on the 3 and 7 counting up from 0 in the smallest you need that millisecond no pleasant way around the best options seen are to store the value in custom number fields and rebuild it every time you fetch the or to store it as a string of a known you can then store an date in the native date type for the sake of but it introduces a conceptual complexity that often

should ask a lawyer about highly unlikely that a layperson is able to come up with a reasonably and actually enforceable license just as not likely for someone with no programming experience whatsoever to write useful in case considering you also copy license agreements verbatim from somewhere else without further research since the text of those license agreements may not be legal to if you a license you stand to potentially lose and in that case you should ask for advice from someone who knows what to as response to op the cc licenses were devised by by people who have studied and are qualified to write legal they did the work of providing easy tools on how to apply that code to your why it looks if you start from definitely not of you could whip up a few but you should do that only if you plan on having to enforce that license in

should be fine for you just need to control when the output of your c program is flushed to make it available to the perl script you can do this in the c program using which will force the buffer from your c program to be pushed out so the perl program can read is nothing inherent about pipes that would cause the perl program to wait for the c program to finish writing before processing its your perl program is written so that it processes one line at a in this context reads one line from but if not one available it will block until one a call to from the c program will make this a look at the article on the implementation section gives a brief description of how pipes are which should help you understand how your processes pipes allow concurrency between and processes reading from and writing to pipes are managed by the scheduler just like other your problem here is with the

side the word is usually used to describe the parts of the string that are delimiter is used to describe the thing that separates the so to make your code more clear you should rename token to delimiter and rename dest to in your function and are several differences between your function and your function does is simply remove the token only call your function once to process all parts of the with strtok you call it multiple times for each part of the string times with null as the first also destroys the source whereas your code uses its own buffer think better to use your own buffer as you stores the position of the next token after each call where the first parameter is this position is then used for subsequent this is not thread safe though and your function would be thread can use multiple different whereas your code uses just being i will give suggestions for how to make a better not a function that is closer to to improve your function emulate think it would be better to make the following your function simply return the out of your loop when you have or a pointer to the first character of your source string that contains the next this pointer can be used for subsequent

so the between returning a copy and returning the reference returning the reference may or may not be it depends on how is implemented by your compiler implementation others have pointed but even if you return the reference the assignment after the function call usually involves a as in name returning the reference may or may not cause problems if the users of your function know what they are storing the reference as reference and using it after the providing object goes out of scope then a you want it and use your object can internally store the string as and return a that there will be no copying of the object going and and always safe your users pull out the raw pointer with and do stuff with it after your object goes out of

spite of sql being a not full featured enough to do without each server software implementing the translation from mysql to postgresql is not unless your schema is automated translation scripts will only get you so very best approach would be to hand translate the and then write your own transfer scripts for the data you should also write verification scripts to make sure the schema and data come over a if your database is important enough to migrate then important enough to spend some time on in the end you would spend at least as much time figuring out the quirks and subtle messes than an automated migration script would cause as in the time to migrate the data but doing it yourself you have the chance to take advantage of features in postgresql that present in as well as the chance to make the kinds of improvements that only come from having the chance to do something a second the bullet and do

stack alignment is when variables are placed on the stack to a particular number of so if you are using a 16 bit stack each variable on the stack is going to start from a byte that is a multiple of 2 bytes from the current stack pointer within a means that if you use a variable that is 2 such as a char there will be 8 bits of unused between it and the next this allows certain optimisations with assumptions based on variable calling one method of passing arguments to the next function is to place them on the stack opposed to placing them directly into whether or not alignment is being used here is as the calling function places the variables on the to be read off by the calling function using if the calling function aligns the and the called function expects them to be then the called function be able to find seems that the msvc compiled code is disagreeing about variable try compiling with all optimisations turned

states too complex for a state but i think running into some problems by trying to make a few of the transitions be handled specially or some machines helpful unless you can label the states in a meaningful means you need to call it something useful like et of the state machine pattern assumes that you have a detached entity that understands the states and how to transition between you have a method like the in your for where it blows up if the state be the state machine should simply prevent transitions that the number of possible transitions is small and and it makes sense to label also recommend naming the transitions as this is probably especially useful if the transitions all do the same thing but in slightly different

suppose i could offer this long long unsigned long tmp root if root 1 value find out how many bytes our value so we do any uneeded if if tmp tmp else if tmp switch case case case case return the was calculated at a very sensitive i got the task of looking into a way to make it this small refactoring reduced the execution time by a third the combination of hardware and compiler long long unsigned long tmp root if root 1 value return course there are both faster and better ways to do but i think a pretty neat example of a come to think of the unrolled loop was actually also a neat digging though the version i can present the second stage of refactoring as which performed even better than the long long unsigned long tmp 1 root while if root value root root tmp root tmp return is exactly the same albeit a slightly different so i suppose it

suspect that this may be difficult or even impossible in suspicion is methods like user input loops and xmlhttprequests return control to the browser in order to and the browser get back control until every nesting level of function call has that means all your including the function that called would have to therefore is languages have features that allow you to effectively execute an asynchronous process as one that appears to the caller to be and similarly the are and javascript does not possess these so the best you can do is timeouts and a callback as an inline function to gain access to the enclosing variables in a closure does at least take some of the pain out of some other languages have to start wrapping every bit of enclosing state in an properties to achieve

the answer is definitively to the first the halting problem does not prove in what suggesting proves the halting problem does not apply to real digital and used this very example as a proof of it a deterministic digital system a program running on real digital the number of possible states is and therefore all possible states are exact amount of memory required for the hash would state of initial initial state would be your hash and final state would be the hash and then have a pair for each initial an operating the state is gigabits of memory across all system such a general purpose program would require an impractical amount of memory to and would not be useful since the system is complex next user input depends on previous system is highly because if you index every possible initial state and associate it with the terminating you would effectively bring the running time of any program to any by zero i mean a very fast running time the time it takes to look up the terminating state it a starting from each of all possible will provide a kind of state map showing halting problem is therefore because there are only three four collapsing to possibilities given any possible initial program will reenter a previously encountered state the initial before exhausting all possible and therefore logically loops program reaches a state identified as before it has a chance to reenter a previously encountered state or exhaust all possible states the initial the simplest program will start from an initial will enter all possible states exactly and then has no choice but to halt or reenter a previously encountered state and loop i will reach roll over back to at which point it will have reentered the initial your index could be described like each initial there is exactly one or zero terminating other for each initial the program either reaches a terminating state a state already encountered since the initial state and cycles for any program running on digital it is often to determine all its states and whether it halts or loops practicality depends solely on how many valid initial states you have you can reduce with input and how feasible it is to take the time to run the program for each of them to termination and store the resulting state in the hash forcing any running time an other uses of capturing state include the function in game console emulators and the hibernate feature of computers not a perfect restoration of since some system memory must be used for the code that restores the state and some memory may never be stored gpu this proves is that any program can be represented by a hash program can be represented by an programs can be simplified to one big function with a massive

the data that caching is required by more than one it sounds like from a service oriented architecture anyway that it belong in either of services you have calling the data being cached really related to either but is something that both services then perhaps it belongs in own seperate have you considered encapsulating your cache in a third and performing a call to retrieve the data you benefits solves your original avoiding the need to read the whole cache from the database several encapsulates the cache in one place for easy allows you to abstract the implementation of the cache away from the other services by putting another service interface in the in suggest the best the only downside is the extra overhead of making the but that surely outperforms having to read the whole cache from the if the data in your cache is very closely related to both of the services that are calling the both services the data in the then perhaps the two existing services should be combined into a single what saying is making some then then principle of soa drawing on is

the values have nothing to do with the type of the generic base then they be in the generic base they should either be in a completely separate or in a base class of the generic in mind that for static you get a different static variable per type argument class never use a public mutable field of public static string class static void assign to different verify that they really are different sounds like you want a different static variable per of your generic base class so you have it your generic base

there a reason you just use the following with the route new controller action may conflict with the default but that would happen with your current system anyway you make a custom inheriting from rather than a custom the is for handling what to do after the route data has been since still using controller and you should still be able to use the if you want to customize how the route data is you probably want a custom if you want to use a route which involve controller and action use is just a wrapper which puts the controller and action into the and calls the same internal helper as in this the route still has a controller and action and so you can still use i lets you specify a route so if you give your route a name you can specify that name in and it will use that route to generate the url may be wrong about that and if so you can still use and manually add the controller and action route

things leap out about the original batch neither is going to help in the long your benchmark be sure to capture the start time the and the end time the your sample do evaluates to something like and the command subtract you need a command that produces a simple scalar time was going to say it be but the batch language is a lot more powerful than it is given credit so here is a simple implementation of for the pax beat me to an answer showing the string splitting while i was fiddling and johannes suggested moving the arithmetic outside of the measured remeber start note that we look at the so calculation work right if the program run spans local do something but probably with more care about odd things will happen if any arguments contain precent signs or carets and there may be no way to prevent capture the end time before doing anything make t0 into a scaler in 100ths of a being careful not to let misinterpret 08 and 09 as starttime 360000 6000 100 make t into a scaler in 100ths of a endtime 360000 6000 100 runtime in 100ths is now just end runtime runtime started at ran for could simplify the arithmetic and be a little more honest about the overall accuracy of this by not bothering with the 100ths of a second here it is in assuming you have a sleep command or some other time timer sleep took 3000 ms to i revised the code and its description as suggested in a think that when the nt team replaced with they thought they get away with making it very but in it is almost an entirely new many of the old favorite commands have new features if the extensions are of those is which prevents variables from modifying the another is which gives you a remarkable amount of the principle trick used here is the new substring extraction syntax where means the two characters starting at offset 3 in the value of the variable named a real take a look at the full description of set at a and if that scare look at and notice that it can parse text out of fixed of time fields containing or reported by frankie in tweaked a couple of and added some that there is a glaring oversight here that probably not going to it work if the command starts on a different day than it that it will do some math related to the time of day and report a but the difference mean it to at least warn about this case is fixing it to do the right thing is fixed error where the is not set properly for single digit this is due to returning notice the using replaces the space with a leading zero and will be set this error only occurred when a script ran from one single digit hour to the

think about presumably you want to store of expression in a storing the whole you distinguish between an identical tree and a hash hashes map a larger set onto a smaller set is why a hash is so by have least the possibility you get an expression hash it and then go look up a result in your which leads to two a hash not in the one that you seen you have to let this one as you have a cached a hash in the but since you store the old expression tree that produced the hash in your no way to compare the newly passed expression to the old you may have a match or you may have a no way to distinguish between those two you return the cached because it might be a even if not a even if it is the exact same expression tree as the one you last how do we know that the backing object a a had elements added or deleted or modified such that the result returned by the expression might be different than the cached you can hash a tree leaf return return is some operation or more generally this is the same recursion we use to evaluate an expression we call

think both are good languages with coherent and concise design and both would be a great choice as a first language to learn some other commonly suggested being i feel that either of these make for a great web development language they both have several drawbacks for that will probably use inside which is a mess that will not allow you to learn neither good general programming skills nor good web programming skills i do believe the skill sets do not overlap all that as a web development platform is also bound tightly to microsoft technologies and i have my issues with ruby you will probably use ruby on rails which is a great mvc framework for web development but it has its own issues and is also very unlike current web development techniques as they are used in it is also rather you want to learn general programming and design some desktop or server either would be a great choice though i will recommend you want to learn web then i suggest going with a more industry standard and also not a really bad language which is java using if you only plan on ever using one tool and be done with then either are good choices and i would recommend ruby on my answer above is relevant if you want to be a good programmer and use this experience as a base for learning other

think is quite but one thing to consider provides operators as template functions that accept two parameters of the same because most conversions arithmetic promotions and are not performed when template argument deduction this means that you would not be able to use any of these additional operators with such if you have a class that attempts to behave like a regular you might have written conversion or templated operators so that you can work because the two arguments are of different so template argument deduction will

think it might be an improvement if when posting example code we at least put comments in that say you should put error handling code in at certain this might at least help somebody using that code to remember that they need to have error this will keep the extra code for error handling out but will still reinforce the idea that there needs to be error handling

think this is likely to teach you the program has to have a certain size before the differences between different programming paradigms really and people likely to write identical copies if the same program in different languages unless the program is examples would also be polluted with a lot of extra things that can be done within the standard library of one but requires libraries in and the programmer who wrote it may be more familiar with one language than so his implementation in some languages representative of how it be more likely to learn the difference between these paradigms the usual by learning what each and how to use	
think what you want to do is pass an arbitrary number of i think what you have here is a case where you have multiple types of in your passing a but you also mention sometimes pass an so it seems to me what you really want to do is declare your callback to take a and a flag to indicate what it something int switch case list case ele passing things as a the list should know the so you have to worry about passing you could define multiple types of callback and always callback the right one based on what sort of processing you need to not restrained to straight c you can use you may investigate using as it is very useful for this sort of

think you can unify all of these because you know what is being used by each you identify which ones you are interested in then you can get each to output to log files in a central location linux for from here you could write a simple utility that parses each log file and massages the data into a single log file in the format that you the awk utility is very good at doing this sort of you could leave them as they are and use something like splunk to index the files for future searching and it really depends on what you require from the log files at a later hope that

those of you with curriculum development what is the best strategy regarding have seen some schools that teach arrays after variables and control often before even teaching this allows teaching of some rudimentary it then brings the problem of how to pass arrays to so it is necessary to go back to arrays pointers are taught and patch things option is to go from variables and control structures to and then teach and once you have teach arrays from and then use that to get to dynamic memory me the second option makes more because unlike simple with arrays it is easy to out of but students who did not yet learn about memory and pointers may not understand what lies outside these interested to know what others teaching is it better to teach arrays before or after

was wondering whether using a and braces approach to programming and to data validation in particular was good practice or this came about from the following was creating a form and i added listeners to all the fields which should mean that the button is only enabled if all the fields in the form have valid i was then writing the code which was run when the button is pessimistic side of me decided that belt and braces never hurt anyone and it hurt to validate the form again in case a bug in my form then i know what to put in if the validation if i do something like i have to create code to display an error message which should never be anyone maintaining this code in future is then going to worry about and possibly be confused by this in theory needless the last thing i want is someone wondering why this particular dialog is never option at the other end of the scale throw new should never i feel dirty even typing that but perhaps a good reason to use it which i have finally i ended up the downside of that is that not really belt and braces since the braces there at so if there is a bug in the code my trousers are still going to fall down as it maybe i have the extra validation at but still a part of me which thinks it be interested to hear what you do in similar the question is asking what is the best way to ensure the form returns valid assume that the output of the form is validated again before it ends up in the database and so belt and braces programming good practice or just introducing needless

wise i think there are a couple of ways you could improve your first is that your script is dependent upon the name of the script not while i think likely change the name of this you never know what mood be in a few years from instead why not just calculate the name of the script next problem is that i believe split function will fail if you ever place the directory in a path which contains a it will cause a path like to appear as much better to remove the split and just use the enumeration by the you are taking a dependency on the current path being the path containing the you should either make that an explicit parameter or use the path containing the file prefer the is the updated version i would gci in a security standpoint you have to consider the possibility that a malicious user adds a bad script into the target if they did so it would be executed with your file and could do damage to the but at the point the malicious user has access to your file likely they could do the damage without the help of your script so probably a minor

would definitely go for spring together with hibernate for persistency related advantage of using spring instead of another framework is that springs philosophy is to be usually when using a framework most probably start to depend on that framework which can be a bad issue if the application is considered to run for a longer time where you then have also to do maintenance spring uses the of basically your code can but it have call but spring will call you call call so for instance you can normal old java and you have to inherit from any big problem not the in software engineering are fight for reducing them as much as possible since they will make your life harder in maintenance later reduces among your components drammatically by managing the instantiation of components through configuration files and the i want to go the best thing is that you start reading some tutorials at the official initially it may need some time in the understanding but once you got it earn a lot of

would not dirty your control version system with such series of auto but i agree with the idea of using a control version system to provide that my suggestion use a repository for your software and another one for store the auto when the work is merge all auto commits in the main repository in only one logical i would do the main the location of your development the location of your work with dirty working remote add foo git fetch the checkout bar the begining of the tag the do git add git commit would not use a cron so you can the autocommits your your job deactivate the pending you have a lot of auto commits in branch and you have tagged the initial commit of the branch with your auto tag push foo user session push foo user session you have published your work and your lecturer may access update your foo rebase barbegin and proceed as described would squash all the there can be only push foo only one commit will be tag tag branch all i think no useful information may be gathered with such kind of i would try to avoid this but if really i would do that

would recommend using subsites or site collections for each meta project site can be defined which can rollup important information for the project the project site can then store more than just the but can become a focus for the project advice is that performance starts to suffer if you use more than site so there is some flexibility can swiftly become unmanageable when storing many documents as there is no good way of moving a subsite between content databases when a content database grows too think the site collection per project architecture will give you greater flexiblity and abvoid the nasty issues with complex lookup it will rely on some fairly clever use of the search results webpart

would stay away from anything that would run too long when working in a that includes some query just to determine a static table layout you want to write the code so you can build a do this type of thing all the but mostly with stored procedure i have most of this in a template i this will display the column nicely within quotes or show function to return this into your into columnnameint columnnamevarchar columnnamechar from sure you have one row for each column in your table you have more just delete the extra ones if you want to see any dates in use the convert as shown this from syscolumns sc inner join sysobjects so on where order by the output in sql server management studio text output and do a square over the column and copy this column based back to your code and a square over the complete values in the left column of the insert statement and if you made a column it will replace the column only and leave the code unchanged to the left and do the same thing for the values in the right of the insert and you now have an insert that will build the data you want but will not waste too much time in the	
would strongly recommend setting up one procedure for a page and managing all sql actions if there are multiple tasks to perform on the page that require multiple just have one procedure manage the other your proceedure can always return multiple recordsets if page will perform faster of data going back and one all code on the sql is already compiled with executions will be able your errors much in one place as in two places having systems to decide if enough to fail passing back and forth to data minimize your points of the transaction is going web server the is left waiting for will save tons of time troubleshooting and will help modularize your code on the sql you can reuse sprocs to perform like tasks and end up with a more fleixble scalable robust

written a few programs along these suggest all you need to to is keep a list of times that events are and every x amount of time on your check your list for you can pick up some optimization if you can guarantee the list is and that each event on the list is due exactly if you have recurring you have to make sure you cover your what i mean if you have an event that is due at and checking every then possible that you could check at and then not again until due to the inprecision of the cpu so need to be sure that one of those checks or still picks up the and that only one of them does you run at both and advantage this approach has over checking only on times you know to be on your list is that allows your list to be modified by 3rd parties without your and your event handler will continue to

wsdl web service description language of your web service does not tell the constructor info of serialization only applies to fields within your datacontract the generated client does not include any methods or constructors of your it only has a parameterless default constructor of you really want to add constructors to datacontract you could open file within your web reference fold in your and find the class and modify if you update your web the customized code will be solution like your created a partial class for the generated datacontract you will know how to do this if you inspect the you need click show all file icon in vs in order to see the	
xml error is because an xml document must have a single root suspect that the php is supposed to generate some xml and then enclose it in something that gives it a single root and that the wrapping process is a total i think we need more information about what the php code is doing to be more you can open the problematic resource in firefox instead of you should be able to view which will show you the content of the that might help you diagnose the if you use maybe you can code up a small http client to retrieve the resource and print out the	
years of using the big ugly mfc assert i have finally decided to ditch it and create the ultimate assert am fine with getting the file and line and even the expression that i can display a messagebox with these and when i press retry the vs debugger jumps to the line containing the assert call opposed to the disassembly somewhere like some other assert so all pretty much what would be really cool would be to the name of the function that i can decide whether to debug it without trying to guess what function in from the if i have the following when the assert the messagebox would show something the simplest way of finding out the current function at it should not use mfc or the even though i do use both of should be as portable as to find the name of the current function at	
you actual solutions themselves and the projects they hold build you mean that they build correctly within the or that you can go to those solution directories on the command line and run or things i would try are first narrow down the offending by telling tfs not to build in turn off support do a binary search by trimming away once you get to the offending build with the parameter to get even more details about the state of the msbuild you can write a small app that invokes the msbuild engine directly and debug that application by catching first chance exceptions and having reflector code in engine	
you add a new query to a given it is going to assume the schema in which it is attached which is why you are getting blank values for the columns you you mentioned having already created the what you need to do is use the server explorer to connect to the database and simply drag that stored procedure over into your xsd work what this will do is create a separate queryadapter that will have just the columns you specified strongly and you can with your gridview using that queryadapter	
you add the keyword to a method the pointer will become and you can therefore not change any member you use more on that keyword is part of the functions signature which means that you can implement two similar one which is called when the object is and one that int counter void void cc new const ccc delete ccc return will the method you can change the instance which you cannot do in the const if you change the method declaration in the above example to the code below you will get some will not is not completely because you can mark a member as and a const method can then change mostly used for internal counters and the solution for that would be the below mutable int void void int return cc new const ccc myclass instance has been invoked delete ccc return would myclass instance has been invoked 2	
you added an event handler to the document list you should be able to limit edit rights on that item to the user that created the often have to copy documents from another system into a list in and in that case the edit rights will be assigned to the system user that transfered the unless you use the approach suggested by kirk liemohn

you are describing is commonly known as and many source control systems have different ways of handling in the most common case derived objects are created during the integration of a new label in the build common other derived objects are compiled object archive files and database an example of source control system handling derived objects is ibm rational does not have good handling of derived objects i would suggest to create a make file for so before you run which all the relevant derived you can put a specific makefile into each directory and make them include makefiles from subdirectories so anytime you commit a just run a makefile in its directory and it will update dervied objects in the entire subtree that you you can add rules to the makefile to set derived objects as after they are makefile stategies see the gnu user make is a tool specifically designed to handle creation of derived objects based on source file modification and

you are storing the data in the session i would make sure viewstate is turned off and you are rebinding it on each postback so at least your not storing all that data in 2 could also considered leaving the viewstate on and changing logic that grabs the session data to bring back one page of data at a you would take in the current page and just return that data so that you could get all the data at first and store it in the then if any other postback actions occurred during that page view where nothing was really going on with the grid you have to rebind each have found that most of the issues i have run across in the past due to too much data being displayed in a grid were more design issues and i would step back and look at the overall problem that was trying to be solved and implement another solution to not have to display so much usually a asks for everything because they consider any alternatives or the impact of their

you can peek at a queue to see if a message is in it before simply query the queue using select instead of receive and you can look at the better bet would be to send the messages and have the stored procedure which receives the messages decide if the message should be tossed out or send hundreds of thousands of messages to service broker at a time without any sort of performance you are seeing performance issues then try sending more than one message per conversation as that is the quickest and easiest way to improve service broker

you create a new projection through a it be expected that your indexes will still apply on the columns that are indexed on the original table and included in the when you filter on the projection not in the udf against the original table with the the indexes no longer you want to do is parameterize the function to take in the you find that you have too many fields that you want to set parameters then you might want to take a look at indexed as you can create your projection and index it as well and then run queries against

you have to read the compiler error messages the first error was is not a a is a namespace brings in all of brings in only baz from want to does two good it brings in a for you to and it bring in all the rest of which is good because you should only bring in what you so as to not accidentally depend on something you realize depending as foo is static in still have to refer to you do something like writing a free function that forwards to in this is a bad idea if only doing it to save some may advise not using using declarations at instead fully qualifying all this is quote and error and it gets in the way of say that you fully qualify every use of class and then management just before about to go to that you use very similar stack because barmatic just bought out your you fully qualified be doing a lot of hoping your regex was if you used a using you can just make a fix to your header in this a using declaration is a lot like a int or a manifest constant or int foo in that it provides one place to change something referred to many fully qualifying a namespace at every use takes away that had you used a using directive and brought in all of namespace your grep might have been even if say management insisted on but you still had to use the barmatic equivalent for baz being for whatever reason bringing in one type at a time is generally the most the way to best protect yourself against inevitable but as yet unknown as in most you want to minimize tedious repetition while keeping sufficient

you need to traverse the list in order as a part of searching for but say for displaying then a linked list is a good if only storing them so that you can look up elements then a hash table will greatly outperform a linked list all but the worst possible hash your application calls for both types of you might consider keeping and using whichever one is appropriate for a particular the memory overhead would be since only need to keep one copy of each element in memory and have the data structures store pointers to these with any optimization step that you make sure you measure your code to find the real bottleneck before you make any the the	
you never would want to store a calculated value in a database in an ideal often necessary down here in the mud and muck of the real suggestion of a trigger is your best you may have to requery the count after each trigger since it may not always be possible to know how many rows were inserted or deleted on and you may need multiple queries if a chance that more than one of your counts could be affected by a single insert or delete since also counting specific also need an update in case one of the values your count filters on is the trigger or triggers may be able to package it all into a single could get pretty	
you not just use a standard css positioning and possibly jquery if not maybe	
you only allocate space for an array of zero following temp not allocate more memory or resize the you are simply writing data outside the corrupting some other part of the application do you want a resizable you can use use the member function to insert new vector also has the member function which tells you the current you want to use the primitive you have to track the size when resizing the array is copy all elements from the old array to the larger	
you only have 1 row in the the cardinality for the index should be of just counting the number of unique you think of an index as a based on buckets a then the cardinality is the number of how it when you build an index over a set of columns then the database goes over all the rows in the looking at the ordered quadruplets of those 4 for each say your table looks like b c d e 1 1 1 200 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 1 what the database looks at is just the 4 columns b c d 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 that there are only 3 unique rows those will become our but get back to in also a record or row identifier for each row in the so our original table looks like a b c d e 1 1 1 1 200 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 3 1 1 when we look at only the 4 columns of really looking also at the row a b c d 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 1 we want to do lookup by and not by row so we produce something like we group all the row ids of rows that have identicle values 00000001 and the values of which are and have become keys for our lookup table into the rows of the original none of this really but it should give you a good idea on how a implementation of an index might be the bottom line is cardinality just measures how many unique rows there are in an and in our example that was the number of keys in our lookup which was that

you possibly want static void int count for n n would put the method in a public static class of your own and make sure you have a using directive that will find worth defining something like this depends on how often use note that it has to be an extension on instead of so we can perform the which makes it less widely	
you post a more complete hard to see how there would be that particular error with out some form of goto or flow changing most commonly see this error in code like the somecondition goto code is fundamentally the reason why is that even though s2 has a not executed if somecondition is the goto statement will jump over the initialization and at the last line of the program s2 will be uninitialized and essentially point to may also want to check out this page which gives hints on how to decipher this particular valgrind common cause for this just found is when you pass over some integer constants to a variadic which are put on the stack as but when the callee gets it as got a problem on was almost about to give up and just consider valgrind being then realised that simply casting it to long fixes my upshot take this messages

your producer you are likely to have some kind of main this is probably the best place to interrupt your instead of using and i suggest you use the java synchronization objects introduced in java could potentially do something like indexer lock lock new public void perform one indexing public item perform your need to make sure that each time the indexer releases the your index is in a legal in this when the indexer releases the it leaves a chance for a new or waiting operation to take the complete and release the at which point your indexer can proceed to its next if no is currently then your indexer just reaquires the lock itself and goes on with its next you think you might have more that one thread trying to do the lookup at the same you might want to have a look at the readwritelock interface and reentrantreadwritelock course this solution is the simple way to do it will block either one of the threads that have the you may want to check if you can just synchronize on your data structure but that might prove tricky since building indexes tends to use some sort of balanced tree or or whatnot where node insertion is far from being suggest you first try that simple then see if the way it behaves suits if it you may either try breaking up the the indexing steps into smaller or try synchronizing on only parts of your data worry too much about the performance of in java uncontended locking only one thread is trying to take the is as long as most of your locking is locking performance is nothing to be concerned

your target audience is technical then treeviews folders are common ways of abstracting hierarchical all variants of the composite the era tended to consider hierarchical categorization less important than a flat space combined with a very fast imho if the size of the dataset is large 1000 then the overhead of hierarchical categorization overwhelms the nominal benefit of having documents placed into nice neat your target audience is then been my experience that users do not get hierarchies and take the time to to figure out more than a single level of	
your the second class bar seem to inherit from this seems to be a typo because it makes sense it to be a the modifier explicitly hides the base class version of the function this means that the derived version of the method effectively replaces the base class here documents the fact that the inherited method is intended as a replacement for the base class version of more see modifier
