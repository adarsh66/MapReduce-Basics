32 bit integer basic math operations of add and multiply are computed implicitly mod meaning your results will be the lowest order bits of the add or you want to compute the result with a different you certainly could use any number of bigint classes in different and for values you could compute the intermediate values in 64 bit long ints and use built in operators to reduce to the right been told that there are special tricks for efficiently computing mod c when c is of the form or that use 64 bit math or a bigint library and are quite more so than an arbitrary modulus and also properly compute cases which would normally overflow a 32 bit int if you were including the intermediate despite hearing that such special cases have a fast evaluation i actually found a description of the that in that somewhere on are the mumblings apparently is a common technique in random number generators which are doing multiplies of mod since 2147483647 is a prime number equal to ask the this clever special case method that i find any discussion mod c quickly for

a hard comparison to make because differences in the respective stacks mean you end up doing the same thing differently and if you do them the same for the purpose of comparison not a very realistic which i is in its most basic form loaded with every interpreted and then it is very much like cgi in this respect is no surprise considering it is roughly 15 years over the years various optimisations have been made to improve the most notably opcode caching with for example much so that apc will be a standard part of php 6 and not an optional module like it is still php scripts are basically session information is file based and mutually exclusive blocks other scripts accessing the same user session until or the script whereas not the case in aside from session fairly easy to have objects that live within the application context in java for that which is much more similar is a key for database access in php is transient connections whereas will nearly always use persistent connection pools and build on top of this to create orm frameworks and the the caches for which are beyond any particular a bytecode interpreted is theoretically faster but the limits to what php can do are so high as to be irrelevant for most 4 of the top 20 visited sites on the internet are php for speed of cost of running the tend to be far more important when you start to scale than any theoretical speed in mind that has primitive type safety and these sorts of things that will make code faster than php can run if you want to do a somewhat unfair sort an array of one million random 64 bit integers in both will kill it because they are primitive types and simple arrays will be more efficient than associative arrays all arrays in php are associative plus php on a 32 bit os have a native 64 bit integer so will suffer hugely for should also be pointed out that is whereas php is interpreted opcode which can make a difference but the flexibility of php in this regard is a good being able to deploy a script without bouncing your server is just drop it in and it but it is less performant though i think arguing really an irrelevant

a lisp programmer i would wish that the java community understands the following as objects can be named or but they can also be objects of this allows functions to be passed around as returned from functions or stored in data this means that functions are first class objects in a programming functions add much to the they just allow you to write functions in a shorter closure is a function plus a binding closures can be passed or returned return this allows the function to refer to variables of its even if the surrounding code is no longer you have in some then the question comes up what to do about there are languages that have but not in the functional programming world a and b as is nowadays the smalltalk had are anonymous for a long but then some dialects of smalltalk added support for as can imagine that you get a slightly different programming model if you add functions and closures to the a pragmatic view the anonymous function adds some short notation where you pass or invoke that can be a good closure plus allows you for example to create a function that has access to some variables example to a counter now you can store that function in an access it and invoke the context for the function object is now not only the objects it has access but also the variables it has access to via this is also but you can see that variable bindings access to object variables now is an when should be something a variable can be accessed in a and when should it be a variable of some object when should something be a closure or an you can use both in the similar a usual programming exercise for students learning scheme lisp is to write a simple object system using result is a more complicated programming language and a more complicated runtime too

a rather old big and complex codebase for a program originally targeted at it turns out that some sections of this program are written in an obscure dialect of x86 assembler called lap after the company and product that produced the assembler done a fairly deep google search and unable to find either the original assembler or any information or documentation about i have found some rather frustrating pages on experts exchange of people asking similar i be able to get this thing to compile until i can either find a copy of pharlap assembler or find enough information about the dialect to translate it to a more masm like either or try to muscle through just figuring it out by reading if none of this is then i just need some help with this and i should at least be able to get one section of the program to a struct declaration in a file that looks like struct bhash struct void rgb3 int int int ulong temp var used by blackbox to us int global so assembler code can see then some assembler that looks like which is presumably trying to make the same type declaration so that some assembler code can use the same cachedata dd pointer to cache data dd contains dd error diffusion dithering dd dd dd rgb value with dithering rolled dd cache dd to use you also need dd uncomment a few lines dd search for to find dd extern the lives in compiles with an error on the last line which looks like this external definition different from previous i think what this is saying is that the assembler version of this struct match the c version of this tried a number of different combinations of word and dword in place of dd in the but i get past this little maybe if i could find a way to get these two declarations to match my need for information about pharlap would be if anyone can think of a better title for this sprawling open to okay it turns out i skimmed over some important this is a file originally written for a phar lap assembler i that trying to assemble using the watcom assember the problem with that particular it turns is it seems phar lap is case while watcom so it sees bhashctl as the same as figured this out with the help of my brother in i never would have thought of case insensitivity being the cause of that lap i need and binaries if

ago we had character set detection for a mail and we rolled our the mail app was actually a wap and the phone expected there were several could easily detect if text was as there is a specific bit pattern in the top bits of bytes once you found that pattern repeated a certain number of times you could be certain it was the file begins with a byte order you can probably assume the rest of the text is that detecting nearly as easy as unless you can detect the surrogate pairs but the use of surrogate pairs is so that usually is except there are no surrogate pairs to we would assume the reader was in a certain for if the user was seeing the ui localized in we could then attempt detection of the three main japanese is again east to detect with the escape if that determining the difference between and is not as more likely that a user would receive but there were characters in that exist in and so sometimes you could get a good same procedure was used for chinese encodings and other these provide satisfactory the user must manually choose an	
agree that separating your actionscript code is the best way to but for binary assets you may want to use if you run into too much also has the benefit that it makes more sense to people who of course they have to understand the associated so communication as very	
agree that the answer to this question depends on the my current environment there are only two developers and less than a thousand users of our if you can ensure that your programming practices include requirements for implementing the business logic in the application layer than you can successfully handle the constraints outside the you have an application that will need to scale well and will eventually be maintained by a large pool of developers and utilized by an untold number of users potentially implementing data constraints in the database can improve efficiency as well as eliminate potential disaster from changes in the application

agree with most of the commentors that code generation is neither good nor i have seen generated code be a great source of pain as well as a pragmatic solution to some problem at in your case i would definitely check out one particular feature of fluent auto more info set you can create persistent classes that are automagically mapped to the db by writing nothing more than your entity this is the right way around defining your domain model in the database is kind of icky least if you can avoid 2 at	
agree with sharptooth in the general but there are sometimes objects that can have states in which some functions are valid and some are in these situations better to defer checks to the functions with these particular want to validate in a if only because that means your objects will always be in a valid but some kinds of objects need and ok	
agree with tom first will require an object per atomicintegerarray just requires the atomicintegerarray object and an array so use the latter if it should also be noted that is not thread the references to the individual atomicinteger objects may or may not be correct if accessed from multiple synchronizing access on the array object itself will eliminate this

ajax encompasses a client side framework it is perhaps best for its server side particularly the what you get with ajax is ajax for the basic without having to write a single line of on the other hand you to write some javascript or go a little working with ajax can soon become a little on the otherhand is lightweight and requires you to write although for most the jquery guys has done a very good job of hiding the ugly javascript stuff so apart from a small learning curve it comes pretty natural if you are on in css problem in using jquery with can be if you mess too much with the dom you might get validation

all know that we can use exception wrapping catch it later where what i would like to implement is distinguishing the types of errors after the stored proc is have field where stored proc dumps its it could be validation validating against db be or authorization error do that in 2 one of which is or a sql short i need a pretty and elegant mechanism to distinguish between the type of error before throwing an approaches i thought the database level have 3 error 1 for 1 for sql error and 1 for any other this could get an error struct where error messages are stored and later can be compared too what if a error message in db hard to other handling	
all major desktop browsers support so do many mobile including opera and safari on the the only major browser i know of that support iframes is the blackberry object tag is supported by most but the implementation is extremely inconsistent across the various wrong with just having a flat page with an ordinary navigation if you are only displaying one page at a and the only interface element being placed outside of the iframe is a tab then why not just integrate the tabs into the page layout and do away with the of any sort tend to break the familiar browser behaviors that people are the forward and back navigation and they completely disable the use of when building a you should try not to restrict or dictate to visitors how allowed to browse your if the user wants to open a link a new they should not be left without a navigation if they make their browser window a particular the page content should fill that not a predetermined area specified by the dimensions of the are inherently makes them which is why so few professional websites use cheap broadband is widespread enough these days that reloading a few extra kilobytes of navigational data makes no difference to the overall user

already hosting all of the sites together in one can be used to pull different parts of the same repository together in various with a repository can introduce an property on the site1 and site2 dirs that says want to avoid any recursion loops here but this has the advantage that in the same repository and can share history you can pull things that are becoming more common from site1 or site2 into commonpieces using our current solution where working migrating stuff from our project repositories into a single repository loses the development since we commonly develop features for one project and then decide to this loss of history happens a worth remembering that while on site1 will automatically update commonpieces with this property in a on site1 will not show things that have changed in have to make two separate one from site1 and one from

also going to assume that is supposed to subtract a number from all items in the reason not getting any result for z is because building the list on the way into the which means that when the stopping predicate prolog works way back out of the recursion and z becomes uninstantiated is z is z is z is z is z is is going into the recursion first and building your list on the way maybe like subtracted is head changed is the order of the rules in the recursive predicate and the terms of the stopping now it recurses until it reaches an empty at which point it instantiates the result variable with an empty list as then it bubbles back up adding values to the list as it does this

always had doubts when it comes to designing proper report of you have the following to be i will use suppose you want to give a report of the various if something goes wrong not really just informative behavior of the easy solution is to put print doing print am starting to do step print did step print am starting to do step print did step print am starting to do step print did step this is quite suppose that this code is going to end up in a i would not expect my library to print stuff i would expect it to do the job sometimes i would like to provide not only in debug but also to keep the user informed that something is actually in the process of being print is also bad because you have control of the handling of your it just goes to and nothing you can do about except solution is to have a module for doing am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step has the advantage that you sort of know a unique place for your logging and you can tinker this service as much as you you can silence redirect it onto a to or even to a disadvantage is that you get a very strong coupling with the logging basically every part of your code depends on and you have calls to logging third option is to have a report object with a clear and you pass it doing am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step am starting to do step did step you can also pass the reporter object to if they have more to it reduces coupling with a but it introduces coupling with the instantiation of the nullreporter this can be solved by using none as default and checking before calling which is because in python you have to write a conditional every time c you could define a if reporter is not doing option is to work and have an signal as your code it emits information with proper status and anyone interested can subscribe to the signals and provide nice and very but requires a little of as i think this can quickly be done with the python battery you can raise exceptions with a meaningful error but this of course can be used only if you are exiting from an error it does not work for occasional like to clarify the fact that the situation is more and not limited just to a sequence of invoked it could also involve control if print to print list of files from remote report could also be into the actual so you would have a in the and routines as a first question therefore do you think is the best design for some code in the case of a to be at the same time silent when noise could be disruptive for the but verbose when to handle a balanced intermix between logic code and reporting code between code and error checking has been solved with what could be done to partition the of reporting from the code logic more thoughts for the think not only a matter of decoupling the logging code from the logic i think also a matter of decoupling the information production from the information similar techniques already in particular to handle ui but i really see the same patterns applied to the logging i accepted the answer from marcelo because he points out at the factual evidence that a compromise is the best solution in this and no silver all the others were interesting answers as and i was really pleased to upvote all of thanks for the information during code best

am currently being offered a job for an it development business i already do my freelance job and pays well this job sounds good and it would enable me to keep my current job while doing the other the thing they want to outsource me without giving me any credit whatsoever for the development but the full the side of getting payment it sounds but on the side of only helping another company build its own reputation using my work i quite like it yes i so i started thinking and came up with possibly encrypting my found some tools online to do that however not sure how good is it to actually do i would it affect the functionality or loading also is it really that recommendable for me to do i know what to think right u guys mind telling me your opinions on the to thing here is not that being contracted by a business so that i develop for them specifically they just want to outsource what i that this it business will pay me for doing it while they tell the client they did it then you can think they be able to duplicate it or they try to duplicate it at least take some time to undestand the but face it in the end if they want to they will be able to understand and replicate my code something like the issue here is that i am interested in working with them since get me jobs abroad in mexico and the jobs would be for another and really like to get to be known but this it business agree to give me some i currently have many other options for getting to be known it recommended to encrypt

an extremely easy probably so much so that most compiler writers even consider it much of an optimization at setting the optimization flag to the lowest level mean completely after will vary in how aggressive they are at merging duplicate string they might limit themselves to a single subroutine put those four declarations in different functions instead of a single and you might see different others might do an entire compilation others might rely on the linker to do further merging among multiple compilation rely on this unless your particular documentation says you the language itself makes no demands in this be wary about relying on it in my own even if portability a because behavior is liable to change even between different versions of a single

and compilation are quite but tend to get lumped together because of both being considered of a simple architecture such as a 6502 or z80 will be fairly straightforward for the cpu chunk of the but there will be a fair chunk of code to write since you need to have a function for each want to automate this in some from an instruction set specification with all the timings and as typing this all out will be very tedious indeed old cpu instruction set specs are easy to so this helps a lot when building top of that need to implement some level of which usually involves handling and generating interrupts as the interrupt of a display device if the emulator is for a game this again will need some level of specification and code but likely have to write most of this by hand as not going to be quite so repetitive hence as the instruction set will involve some sort of language spec of whatever language you are going to be implementing the compiler and a target which you will be aiming to output code the output could be straight to could be assembly or could even be another language is really just a but it counts as compilation when the target is considered since be running on some sort of hardware or vm platform then you will be unlikely to have to worry about interrupt handling and that sort of for both are and for the emulator need to make it work very accurately unless you pick very simple things to also need to create some sort of integrated debugger for the otherwise close to impossible to tell what is going wrong when it invariably does for a compiler it should be fairly straightforwward to translate a toy language or a small subset of a more complex and build it up as you go that with both of these items you need to be able to produce input to test and if you cannot produce simple inputs then find it very difficult to get debug from the very alone makes compiler work easier to get and that want to have something which emulates a full console or something straight away

applets would seem to have their best analogies to browser in if not no perfect mirror between java and in this respect some technolgoies seem to be more similar to each other in certain respects and others in different given that java was developed largely for the purpose of and the framework for desktop there are naturally going to be fundamental although wpf browser applications are of course restricted to the windows platform they perhaps resemble applets more greatly in the respect that they can utlise the entire among other as has been pointed silverlight is more analogous to terms of the equivalent is effectively the whole of the web application side as opposed to though that is being slightly perhaps more most resembles webforms or mvc for that in the case of the former content is compiled into java whereas in the case of the latter content is compiled into so maybe assemblies of are most akin to servelets though to be honest i know enough about the java side of things to make much of a the histories of and java began somewhat differently they were both vm and java inspired nonetheless in many aspects they have converged over time so that nowadays pretty much find an equivalent technology in either of the two though often in one there has been significantly more development success is one example in favour of whereas applets are perhaps in favour of hopefully at least provided an overview of where the similarities and differences lie in the two

approach is a bit more putting the filter parameters in tables and then using group having and count to filter the used this basic approach several times for some very sophisticated and it works very well me also join on the artist and venue dimension tables get the results as needing and then join the results on the artist and venue tables to get those dimension search for the entity in a sub then in an outer query get the dimension values you keeping them separate should improve table table into id from name in into id from name in as as as as on as on on as on between and interval 1 from from on a netbook and suffering for so leave out the outer query getting the artist and venue names from the artist and venue tables option would be to filter the and tables in whether this is worth it depends on how influential the join on the concert table my assumption here is that there are many artist and but once filtered on the concert table filtered by the the number of decreases there is often a to deal with the case where no are from experience it is better to deal with this that use if statements and queries specially suited to those a single sql query can be written to handle but is much slower than the programatic writing similar queries several times may look messy and degrade but the increase in complexity need to get this to be a single query is often harder to similar layout could filter concert by artist as filter results by venue as join results on dimension tables to get etc inner inner group inner inner group cascading the each subsequent filtering has a reduce set it has to work this may reduce the work done by the group by having section of the for two levels of filtering i would guess this to be unlikely to be original may still be more performant as it benefits additional filtering in a different in your there may be many artist in your date but few which meet at least one there may be many venues in your date but few which meet at least one before the group all concerts are eliminated the meets none of the the venue meets none of the criteria you are searching by many criteria this filtering also where venues artists share a lot of the filtering also when would i use the or when would i use the cascaded original few search criteria and are from each cascaded lots of search criteria or tend to be similar

are a lot of different network simulators dependant on how detailed you want to do your and what kind of network you want to and genesis are good if you want to simulate full biological networks geussing you probably even down to the behaviour of dendrites and split and some others are good for doing population simulations where you create the population on a basis and see what the whole population this is pretty much the standard and is used a lot in research and commercial so there are worth looking i know that ibm use split for some of their is good if you want to use differential equations to model what a population would but this approach is relatively new and computationally expensive very sure if that is exactly what you if you google any of the names in caps along with the word you will end up at the relevant web page

are various different approaches here the under two main each typically with their own benefits and in terms of effectiveness and it is probably best to choose the simplest algorithm for whatever application and only use the more complex variants if necessary for whatever that these examples use since that will deal with null elements you could do better than zero for null if if t is constrained to struct it is also you can hoist the lookup out of the function if so you use operations on the hashcodes of the individual entries which are then this will lead to the same end result regardless of are several obvious options on static int int hash foreach element in hash hash return downside of that is that the hash for is the same as the hash for if not a problem for your situation probably the simplest static int int hash foreach element in hash unchecked return is fine hence the explicit are still some nasty cases and but more likely to be particularly with in the case of lists that may contain such you could always implement a custom hashing function one that takes the index of recurrence of the specific value as a parameter and returns a unique hash code is an example of such an algorithm that gets around the aforementioned problem in a fairly efficient it also has the benefit of greatly increasing the distribution of the hash codes generated the article linked at the end for some a analysis of exactly how this algorithm produces hash codes would be quite but testing it across a large range of input values and plotting the results should verify it well static int int hash int int bitoffset stores number of occurences so far of each var valuecounts new foreach element in curhash if out bitoffset the current hash code is shifted one further left on each successive recurrence of a value to widen the 37 is an arbitrary low prime number that helps algorithm to smooth out the hash return has few if benefits over small numbers and a mix of positive and negative numbers they may lead to a better distribution of hash as a negative to offset this becomes a useless entry contributing nothing and any zero element results in a can zero not to cause this major static int int hash foreach element in int h if hash unchecked return other core approach is to enforce some ordering then use any hash combination function you the ordering itself is immaterial so long as it is static int int hash foreach element in f is any you like returning hash return has some significant benefits in that the combining operations possible in can have significantly better hashing properties of bits for but this comes at significantly higher the sort is log and the required copy of the collection is a memory allocation you avoid given the desire to avoid modifying the implementations should normally avoid allocations one possible implementation of would be similar to that given in the last example under the addition section any constant number of bit shifts left followed by a multiplication by a prime you could even use successive primes on each iteration at no extra since they only need be generated if you were dealing with cases where you could calculate and cache the hash and amortize the cost over many calls to this approach may yield superior also the latter approach is even more flexible since it can avoid the need to use the on the elements if it knows their type and instead use per byte operations on them to yield even better hash such an approach would likely be of use only in cases where the performance was identified as being a significant if you want a reasonably comprehensive and fairly overview of the subject of hash codes and their effectiveness in blog would be worthwhile in particular the a simple hashing algorithm

arguments are handled by the shell assume you are using bash under so any terminal settings should not affect since you already have quoted the argument it ought to the only possible explanation i can think of is if your command is a wrapper script and messes up the escaping of the arguments when passing on to the real this is easy to or perhaps a bit hard to do correct wrapper script should pass all its arguments on as any other version is most likely a bug with regards to being able to handle embedded spaces this is not uncommon to do however also any occurrences of or similar are troublesome and must be written as possibly in order to handle embedded spaces and this is sinned against a reason for the not so intuitive syntax is that the original joined all arguments as which did not work for embedded then was introduced that expanded to for all parameters and if no parameters are given it should expand to unfortunately some unix vendor messed up and made expand to even in case of no and to work around this the clever not so hack of writing was making only expand if parameter is set avoiding expansion in case of no my wrapper assumption is wrong you could try to debug with outfile java find out what arguments are passed to example from running 93 vars enoent such file or enoent such file or enoent such file or enoent such file or

assignment operator is not thread means if your threads are only reading the array if the array was initialized at programme start and does not change then you are if a writer exists who writes new you are vulnerable to a race basic issue is a reader begins to read an the value is loaded from memory into a at this the reader swaps the writer then updates the value in the reader then swaps back in and acts on the value he loaded which is no longer means that things like do not work for 10 trigger when the value of is no longer believe in you should have access to the function such as these will permit you to easily achieve thread safety in this

at why you might be like to add an explanation of what the second code sample actually does why not think you are getting confused by this line because this line is often described as a bit there are technically 2 different entities being changed here the new object is created and the variable is assigned its line actually creates a new object on the heap dynamic memory call this so that this new object on the heap can be its memory address is stored in role is to act as an so we can find we often is a because we are lazy the statement is technically is a dictionary on the heap and foo stores its memory address so that we can find it and use you then run the are using the address in to find a different object call it in the and make yet another object on the heap with the same if keeping this is now 3 objects in is its memory address is then stored in the this storing into overwrites the existing memory address one that pointed to this means that we have no remaining pointers to and hence will never be able to find it this is why we say has hope you can see from this situation why was never needed only ever intended to use to access the

avoid the zend style approach you mentioned the problem is it becomes trivial to create two different point to the same while this part of the success of mvc style frameworks for web applications is they make it easier to provide a clean url and to associate a single url on your site with every the approach offers little advantage over query approach take here is to eschew and just just use will be passed into the action method as an example extends public function doing it this leaving it up to the end users of your system to decide how they want to handle style while encouraging a design that leads to more single resource

believe the default for projects built through visual studio is you use your executable depend on a dll being present on the target if wrapping this in an it probably be an issue and you can go either use so that i can ignore the whole dll as points vital to be if linking with other you need to use the same option they if using a third party almost certain that need to use the dll version of the runtime	
believe the idea of is more about when you open and close the not about getting performance idea is that a session will start a transaction before your code is ever business logic your framework has full access to the database until the possible transaction is committed for instead of having to do it each time idea of is important so that you can mix web frameworks and lazy loading of if a getter method is called while rendering your data after your code has been and you closed the you lazily load that	
best thing is to parse the content as not as code execute the for json is a very easy way to assemble data from a server at a but you should never execute you should parse the data with a regular expression to confirm it is correct and only contains sql injection usually happens when you accept form data in the key would be to check for sql reserved words that cause a namely you could easily create a list of reserved words and run them through a regex expression probably has something nice or on the i am sure php could do this easily crud retrieve update and verbs are nice to look but forget about the server side sql stored procedures that already exist to do things or worse execute sql statements you could url encode the characters if you need to use them outside of a web page

biggest difference is that selenium has support for different browsers just ie or see selenium has a remote control server which means that you need to run the browser on the same machine the test code is you can therefore test your web on different os general i would recommend using used watin few years but i satisfied with its stability has probably improved by the biggest plus for selenium for me is the fact that you can test the web on different	
bindings with the are a bit complicated because there are two things it a binding for the and a binding for which one of those values is what makes it even more complicated is that there are a couple of perfectly legitimate ways of doing and which one you choose entirely depends on your structure to some personal in order to get a list of you bind the in your probably bind this to the key of an in this each menu item represents one by the title of the menu item is the string returned by calling on each item in the if you want to use a different property for the menu you can also bind the just make sure the key path you specify for has the key path for as its prefix you might use for and for will give you menu items that represent what you need next is some way of identifying the selected there are three different bindings you can and they the index of the array object that the user the object value of the objects in the and the string title of the selected item of the objects in the array if you bound that in your you might bind to a property on your controller when the user clicks the you only have to refer to the

blog about stuff i really want to	
blog post great programming industry sort of answers short the first microcomputers run and the number of programmers was growing faster than the new ones could be educated by the old the programming culture basically started over in the early 1980s on and then the microcomputer programmers had to spend the next 30 years going through the growing pains that the programmers had already gone post rescued from wayback machine and posted great programming industry january while back i bought a copy of structured programming available as a free pdf from the primarily so that i could read essay on structured expanded version of in addition to on structured it contains an essay by hoare on and one by hoare and dahl on program was this last program which ended up having the greatest impact on it describes a programming language called simula simula 67 is an extended version of algol which contains some extra simulation it has these things called which each describe the behavior of a bunch of individual it has this thing which allows one class to include all of the attributes and behaviors of another also this function and statically typed and garbage similarity to java was so striking that i was depressed for i started looking a little bit forward and backwards from java and simula and i found some interesting similarities between a progression of languages that happened since the microcomputer revolution and a progression that happened before the microcomputer trying to interpret history a good portion of which i did not live so i realize that i am entering dangerous i encourage those of you who lived through this history to confirm deny any parts of my speculation that you am more familiar with the more recent so start 4k basic for the altair you can try out on peter simh based altair began a period of popularity for followed by one for pascal and and ignoring garbage collection in the rough order in which features were added level control structures while with and and recursive noticed that i can construct a very similar progression going from fortran to algol 60 to simula with the exception that the object oriented features come more or less at the same time as garbage i realize that i am picking and choosing my comparison points making me vulnerable to the texas sharpshooter also using a progression of popular languages for the languages and a progression languages that each sort of inspired the next for the but i have often felt like history is repeating and this particular pair of sequences worked as a lense to focus my have a hypothesis that many parts of the programming industry essentially rebooted with the microcomputer and two possible reasons that may have contributed to this reason alan kay has argued that when people join a community faster than they can be a new pop culture develops where things which used to be common knowledge among the community become relatively little is it possible that the microcomputer revolution caused the number of programmers to grow so quickly that the overall more ignorant programmer communities of the early 1980s needed to repeat the evolution that their predecessors from the mainframe and minicomputer eras went reason the early microcomputers just have the horsepower to run the more sophisticated programming systems that had been developed on mainframes and trying to run a smalltalk or lisp system in or or 64k on a 1mhz processor just particularly by the mid 1980s the microcomputers were powerful enough to do some of the fancier but by maybe the new programmers had spent enough time in their impoverished environments that they were only able to be drug into higher level programming languages a little bit at a my speculations are then it is kind of depressing that we have lost so many but it is also kind of encouraging that we are making because it would mean that we stuck in an endless cycle of technology reinventing the same thing over and but instead we are almost caught up to where we were before our industry did a great and we are getting closer to stepping into genuinely new i were to continue the two progressions of languages that i made i would continue the older one into and the newer one into with the new features being something like and was actually inspired by simula i and not simula but alan team paid a lot of attention to simula 67 in the i read somewhere i find the link that simula begin was required reading in the learning research group at xerox by glomek at denatale collection is nearly as old as the use of mathematical formulas in programming lisp is of the same vintage as fortran and cobol initial conception of programming purposely left out inheritance as he like the way dahl and nygaard had done it in just wrote about concept of

couple of years i ran into the very same issue at an ecommerce company where we upgraded their website to the main issue is that we had no idea how many customers had the old asp pages in their as well as the issue of yes you can map the asp extension to but you lose the ability to run the asp files at so that would require that you update all asp which may not be best solution i found at the time was to implement an isapi redirection filter in this is an app that is run by iis the asp or it would make a decision based on the url or any rules you whether it should allow the asp files to run or whether they should be or use to handle the it is not always a clean since it runs before your request and confusion can happen later if other developers know it is so make sure if you go this that your website has plenty of comments or documentation to let developers know there is this thing in iis is a good explanation of how to implement this in code go here and check it

decision process for me is pretty all new development will be done with existing sites that need minor modifications will continue to be existing sites that need major modifications will be candidates to move to basic reason that making the switch has to do with testability and imo mvc web sites are significantly more i can test everything but the view logic with unit tests by using and testing htmlhelper extensions i can even test a fair amount of view with webforms i had to jump through lots of hoops to test codebehind and as a result left a lot of the app for manual also feel that the architecture is simply better from a design because of the clear separation of concerns less tempting to insert business logic in the wrong place the it makes conceptualizing and understanding the application much also able to reuse even view code with less effort because i have extraneous bits of logic from other layers hanging around to get in the only real downside i see at present is that not as mature and you already have as many reusable components built for i expect that to over even though it is possible to intermix mvc with i see retrofitting existing apps as a viable alternative unless there is significant other work to be just my but i would rather start from scratch with mvc than try and get an existing app to work with i suppose it would depend on the size of the but anything with any significant number of pages is going to have a lot of routing

does sounds like fragmentation is caused by you allocating objects on the then deleting some now have a hole in the memory that is if you allocate another object too big for the the hole will remain eventually with enough memory you can end up with so many holes that they waste you way around this is to try and decide your memory requirements up if got particular objects that you know you are creating many try and ensure the same can use a pool to make the allocations more efficient for a particular or at least let you track it better so you can understand going on and come up with a good way of doing this is to create a single bool byte need to tune the value 20 to what your program need to pick a good pool size the pool up front when your program starts and it so that it is as big as the maximum requirements for your you may want to heapalloc it the equivalent in your os so that you can control when it appears from somewhere in you application override the new and delete operators for a suspect class so that they return slots from this your objects will be stored in this can override new and delete for classes of the same size to be put in this pools of different sizes for different go for the worst offenders at done something like this before and it solved my problem on an embedded i also was using a lot of so i created a custom allocator for stl custom allocator there are loads of this was useful for records stored in a my program

drawing the meshes are you doing if using opengl then there is a much better way to go and save yourself all the all the polygons are always two only reason why you would want to use lighting is if you have an open or partially inverted mesh and you want to somehow indicate what part belong to the inside by having them the problem posing is an open problem in geometry processing and afaik there is no general way that can always determine the as you there are heuristics that work almost approach is reminiscent of a famous choose a vertex on the mesh and shoot a ray from it in the direction of the if the ray hits an even number of faces then the normal is pointed to the if it is odd then the normal is towards to notice not to count the point of origin as an this approach will work only if the mesh is a closed manifold and it can reach some edge cases if the ray happens to pass exactly between two polygons so you might want to do it a number of times and take the leading

far as i strings are immutable in i kind of understand that means if you string1 string is destroyed and you get a reference to a new string what happens if you have the same string in different places around your have a string hash assigned for identifying several so for example a is identified by a hash value of the properties of that that way easy for me to check to for each hash is computed separately all the properties are taken into account so that to separate instances can be equal even if they differ on some question how does delphi handles those if i compute to separate hashes to the same 10 byte length what do i two memory blocks of 10 bytes or two references to the same memory a change is composed by some properties read from the database and is generated by an individual the tchange class has a gethash method that computes a hash based on some of the values not resulting on a other threads receive the change and have to compare it to previously processed changes so that they process the same hence the hash as they have separate two different strings are trying to determine if be a real improvement to change from string to something like a 128 bit hash or be just wasting my version of delphi is delphi delphi strings

first should not the static variable requires a constant second sets each time the function is so there was no need to make it in the first the first notation was correct initialized to say then it would be initialized once when the program starts and would thereafter only take new values when the code changed the second notation still sets on each call to the and so renders the use of if you try hard you can devise scenarios under which the second version has a use for for if the function returns a pointer to it that other code then then it might be but that is esoteric in the extreme and would be a pretty bad

garbage collector do anything with those as the runtime allocate just remain	
general answer is that garbage will tend to be collected less often but the gc pauses will tend to be is assuming you already have more memory available to the vm than your working set otherwise you might be spending a lot of time in garbage gc characteristics vary greatly depending on which collector you are using and which version of and whether you specified a higher in addition to the higher older versions of java did not resize the young generation space after the vm had so even if you specified a really large the size of the young generation would still be really small so you would see frequent young generation a young generation collection there will be some objects that will be promoted to the tenured space even though they are this means that the tenured generation will slowly fill up with dead young requiring periodic full the number of such objects that end up in the tenured generation is proportional to the number of young gcs constant activity in your so the advantage of a larger young generation is that there will be fewer young generation and therefore fewer objects from the young collection will be promoted to the tenured are a number of tuning parameters besides for java and you will have to experiment with them since the optimal settings will vary for each

getting the infamous exception from my application when i call into a native this is being done from a managed application on windows ce 5 compiling the same dll for windows xp using the same managed application and everything works fine the routine in the dll is doing some very complex recursion which is ultimately what is causing the but it works fine on a seems like i may just need to adjust the stack size when building the i believe the default stack size for both ce and xp are both 1mb when using the visual c compiler using visual studio if that if they both default to the same not sure why one would overflow and the other would i tried adjusting the stack size with the compiler flag and the linker flag but that seem to do it is also not entirely clear to me that i can specify the stack size in a but rather the executable must set but if that is the case how would i adjust the stack size for my managed process to use when calling into the native overflow from native dll called from managed

glad you was thinking of asking a question like does cpan have to suck so but decided it worth sacrificing my reputation when i already know the and since this question is marked thank you for not moderating me down for giving my personal take on this even if you think i am mistaken or some i did quite a lot of perl coding in the and enjoyed but eventually concluded that the language lacked a lot features that were needed for i became a developer for several and now am now a very technical project i still use perl for scripts and data crunching and other bits and and have recently started using perl scripts to test the web services our coders have i came to for the but stayed for the pleased to see the language has grown up and has all sorts of fantastic like moose and mvc and templates and so and would like to be using and i but it is taking and i only have a few hours now and then to work with why it to answer the the obvious most perl programs need cpan more than one way to do i need modules to do a lot of things that i would use modules for if it was easy to do for i have been parsing xml documents with and regular i know wrong the first step to recovery is admitting you have a but i can copy and paste the code to do this in a few or i could go away and try and make cpan work for another month or lets get a little more cpan is earlier this year i tried to use cpan to install moose because i had read great things about it and was keen to do proper oo programming in perl and for it not to be so i followed the install and pressed hundreds of time before getting dumped on with pages and pages of compiler warnings in the final what the hell do i do my main dev box has some sort of moose module just waiting am to bite me in the ass when i least expect that was about two months and i have not been i speculate that lots of have dependencies on other programming languages and that makes it more brittle opposed to languages whose libraries are coded in the same i further speculate that experiences like this scare potential users for cpan beginners is where is the authoritative cpan documentation the introduction and tutorials for and how was i supposed to know i have been reading cpan documentation on and off for a few and am starting to figure out where things see that almost all individual perl modules on cpan are beautifully documented but it took me a long time to find that install process is too four steps and hundreds of prompts may have been okay ten years ago when there were fewer packages and fewer but now it is just why i just type something like in my shell and have it be this is particularly given that advanced users often claim portability is a citing things like packages and par that i still and why is installing locally even harder when so many people seem to want to do are vexing like whether i should install cpan modules with cpan or with the package management where advice is more there is more than one way to do and when you start doing advanced you have to make decisions about how to install modules and what modules to use and where do you remember a beginner and the documentation is kind of fragmented and the learning curve is my solution has been to try and work around this by not using cpan while i read a little advanced perl has a very steep learning advanced perl users apparently do not remember this and cannot see imo there is a world of difference between using perl as it was originally conceived as a practical extraction and reporting language with powerful regular expressions and using it as a modern development platform with oo and templates and mvc and all sorts of other i have yet to find a incremental path from casual perl use to advanced perl there you apologies for the d

have done this trie in c with 8 bit and simply used the array version alluded to by the i am guessing that you want full unicode support a char is among other assuming you have to have support for the lookup is probably your best as a 64k entry array in each node really work very the only hack up i could think of on this is to store entire strings or possibly on branches that do not yet depending on how sparse the that adds a lot of logic to detect the and to split them up when an alternate path is is the read vs update update jul 2013 strings have a function like java to get the bytes for a string then having an array in each node to represent the current byte value is probably a good way to you could even make the arrays variable with bounds indicators in each since many nodes will have only lower case ascii letters or only upper case letters or the digits in some

hoping someone can provide some advise for an easier way to deal with this i am working on creating a flattened view of a highly normalized set of the goal of flattening is to provide a view which normal people can use to develop reports the source data contains a couple of tables as table variables int not null not not primary key unique table int not null references runs on delete int not null references on delete not primary key in the record values table corresponds to one of the variables in the original input say an address or an account for an input record that has 12 variables in there will be twelve rows in the record values inputs to the original process include records of varying widths and variable these are split out into tuples in the i am writing a procedure to reassemble the variables back into a record that looks like is actually an underlying account current approach is to dynamically build the table by finding the unique variables for the given set of runs not important and then building a sql string that will create the challenge is how to efficiently load this resulting work table from the original since the names and number of the variables varies with the only way i can think of to approach this is through something a cursor for the list of each variable in the create a cursor to find all the record values for that for each record update the appropriate in the work is going to run as the parent tables have of millions of anyone have an idea about how to generate an approach that i can use to do one update per destination anyone jump on the design of the original tables there were business reasons to do it this i like but there were good reasons for doing for any thoughts you can flattening name value pairs into a

i assume allows you to reuse session identifier only if we operate in cookieless but not if we use cookies to store session from my allows you to reuse a session for if you make a request and your query string contains an expired creates a new session and uses that session the problem is that a session id might inadvertently appear in a public place such as in a results page in a search this could lead to multiple users accessing the server with the same session identifier and then all joining the same session with the same shared not sure i understand how reusing session identifier could cause session id to appear in a results page in a search avoid this potential security recommended that you include the optional regenerateexpiredsessionid attribute and set it to true whenever you use cookieless this a new session id will be issued if a user connects with an expired session the only drawback is that this process also forces the current page to lose all view state and form because performs a redirect to make sure the browser has a new session needs to perform a redirect to make sure browser has a new session it just extract session id from the url and throw it when using if a client sends an invalid session id a stale cookie for the server will reject the generate a new id and send that value back in the cookie with the to be sure i understand what you are session is and if you make a but your cookie contains a session id of an already expired then server will generate a new if session is cookieless thus id is contained in url then by default will create new session using that same the redirect is performed to ensure that the client received the new session id value and properly sends it back with the just a that why it instead just put new session id in a url and send it there must be a reason why this work and thus redirect is session	
i believe it if you follow the practice this may be impractical for a large program written in c because of the degree of manual labour this may but in a more modern language most of this work is done for you because an out of memory condition results in a thrown benefits of doing this consistently are that the program will not enter an undefined state due to the out of memory condition resulting in a buffer overrun obviously leaves the possibility of an undefined state due to an early exit to the although this is a different class of having done your program can consistently handle the error or if the failure was a critical decide to quit in a graceful

i connect to the sql server 2008 remotely it only works after that the server the service cannot be stopped or restarted and when trying to connect again it gives a server has connections the default port is set to 1433 and i cleared the 0 from the dynamic i enabled the ip and the public ip and set the 1433 ip to named pipes and the other protocol memory or are am connecting from the remote machine using the user and a strong the server is set to accept both authentication for the first time from the remote machine works queries work and data can be retrieved from the after disconnecting and trying to connect again it gives a timeout this error is generated because the sql server is hanged this point it is impossible to stop or restart the sql server service from the service the only solution is to restart the connecting to the server locally from sql management studio still think it has something to do with going into an infinite loop or it drop the connection on the 1433 port after disconnecting from the remote machine and it still waits for input from server 2008 remote connection only works

i have time to address all your questions at the moment may come back to this tomorrow but i can quickly answer the first it ok to use one file for all of my technically as in the language will allow you to do but you beyond the benefits of improving the organization of your it also lets you use a nice feature of php known as you follow the example that page you can define the function as makes it so that you have to explicity include all the files with your class as long as you put them in files named the same as the class autoloading will automatically include files as they are that in your code you show that you have a class named if you save this definition to a file named when you have a line of code new will automatically include at that this is very and is definitely good motivation to keep each class in its own

i made my own carousel control in i have stumbled upon a bug and was wondering if anyone knew how i could fix this like a method call or a series of methods calls or some here is a print screen of my you can clearly see with this my mouse pointer is over the button with 16 written on but the button with 18 written on it is the one that is blue as if my mouse were over that i also set the tooltip to be bound to the content and the tooltip says my mouse is over the button with 18 one this should be the correct behavior as 18 is the buttons thus the button with 18 on it should be on top of the button with 16 on wpf did not render the canvas in such a fashion and i was wondering how to overcome i tried but i had no the left side of the canvas shows what it should look but the right side fails to produce the same result even though the values are and even this screenshot proves my point that this is a bug in canvas

i realize this question was asked and but i have specific questions about this that i feel were not clear on that thread and prefer not to get lost in the shuffle on another thread as threads said that rendering the email address to an image the way facebook does is overkill and unprofessional user experience for and it seems that the general consensus is to use a javascript solution using html entities or some other method that breaks up makes the string unreadable by a simple the application building even need the i just need to display the email this is a business web so it needs to as professional as here are my i go the route and pass the html entity version of each are there no web crawlers sophisticated enough to execute the javascript and pull the rendered text or is this considered best practice and completely almost spammer so unprofessional about the image if facebook is one of the highest trafficked applications in the world and not at all run by why is their method completely dismissed in the other thread about this your answer in the other is to not bother myself with this issue and let the spam filters do all the please explain why you feel this we are displaying our email addresses that they have given and i feel responsible to protect them as much as i if you feel this is please explain obfuscation

i think the largest hurdle learning so much as gaining experience in writing commercial windows software and web could argue that good development practices are and only can really be acquired through experience in actually developing a project that being my best advice would be to start learning and practicing object oriented design patterns and practices and then applying them to a specific designing and maintaining an website for would help you to experience the intricacies of developing with also give you insight into how to and interact with key operating systems such as you may quickly find is that mastery of in isolation for to build a half decent website you are likely going to have to also understand something of databases an alternative for data reading blogs and msdn articles can be very but usually applicable to the current flavours of the establish a specific goal to achieve and go about researching designs and strategies to implement check out some of the patterns and practices it covers a wide range of topics many of which include design patterns and strategies which may be helpful as you learn the there are also a lot of projects to be found on and take code project with a grain of

implemented a lot of the code in zend other have the reason that returns strings instead of native php integers or floats is that database extensions return and the reason for that is that there might be no native php type to represent certain database is a signed by the php type is limited to so if you fetch data from the database and implicitly convert it to some values might be there are several other similar for and the string representation for all data types is the best way to remain simple and be safe about avoiding data and avoid writing lots of code to do data type that extra code would incur a performance if you have specific cases where you need database results to be mapped to native php data you should implement it yourself in your application code in a custom

in the process of reviewing a code base and trying to determine how to migrating it from to not an overnight project and the suggestion which i have received is to write new code against java 5 and migrate the old code in a no expert in the new features in java 5 i know of but have never written any for production features of java 5 are typically used in production are there features to be avoided not considered to be are the best refactoring strategies which i can use migrate a code base of this make changes to classes one at a time only when a class is objective reduce risk on the code limitation resources to do advice is appreciated thanks in a year too but better late than you for all of the comments lots of great points of in the life of a software always going to be the projects you strive to finish but never get around to because of something more respect to the use of java 5 that it was something which was required in the production so that was why we did not use java found that the stronger typing for enums and unboxing of primitives were the features i tend to apply the both to old and new the refactoring was fairly but code comprehension improved significantly and standards became easier to the ones i had the most trouble with was the i think a concept which i still had a chance to fully grasp and appreciate so it was difficult for me to find previous cases where the application of generics was again to everyone who contributed to this thread and apologies for the late follow for migrating code base from java to java

is definitely measurable overhead when calling a virtual function the call must use the vtable to resolve the address of the function for that type of the extra instructions are the least of your not only do vtables prevent many potential compiler optimizations the type is polymorphic the they can also thrash your course whether these penalties are significant or not depends on your how often those code paths are and your inheritance my opinion having everything as virtual by default is a blanket solution to a problem you could solve in other you could look at how classes are generally the header for a class should make quite clear which functions can be overridden by derived classes and how they are having programmers write this documentation is helpful in ensuring they are marked correctly as would also say that declaring every function as virtual could lead to more bugs than just forgetting to mark something as if all functions are virtual everything can be replaced by base classes private everything becomes fair by accident or intention subclasses could then change the behavior of functions that then cause problems when used in the base

is one category of virtual functions where it still makes sense to have them consider the following base inline virtual derived1 public base inline virtual implicitly calls derived2 public derived1 inline virtual implicitly calls foo delete virtual call to delete will perform a virtual call to call correct derived class this call is not however because each destructor calls parent destructor in these cases are the compiler can inline since they do not call the base class functions same principle exists for base class constructors or for any set of functions where the derived implementation also calls the base classes

it is generally possible to call a dll function from multiple since every thread has own stack and calling a dll function is more or less the same as calling any other function of your own it is possible depends on the dll functions using a mutable or example if you do something like it is most certainly safe to be used from different in this example you guarantee that between and no other thread makes a different call to if the dll functions do not depend on some kind of predefined all necessary parameters are available at once and all other configuration is the same for all you can assume be it might be possible that a dll function looks but internally uses which if for example if the dll creates a temporary file with always the same name or it accesses a database which can only handle one request at a it counts as a shared i think of better the dll vendors that their dlls are use them from multiple threads without if they are not or even if the vendors know you should play it safe and use least until you run into performance in that case you could try creating multiple which wrap your dll calls and use them as

just completed my mips assembly class and i have a suggestion for use pc used pc and qemu and the best for general course work is the assembler and runtime the editor is it crashes less and it allows you to easily debug and set it is open source and created by missouri state comes as a file so you can run it on both windows and mips the general an easy way to tell if a number is even or odd is to and 1 with the number and if the result is 0 then the number is since we want all the even numbers in a series we can just loop and increment our number by 2 like you did in your posted adding an immediate value you should use or not you also said you wanted to put the result in register but this is not a valid mips check out mips wikipedia link to see a list of all the register modified your program to work it stores the final result in and then prints the final li 0 loop li 0 sum of even addi 2 generating even numbers in register add compute the bne loop if t0 reached 100 then go to li la syscall print out li move syscall print out actual li 10 terminate program run syscall exit running this in mars i get the program is finished running

just hide the key and decrypt it when you need using the key is the complicated crackers might set a breakpoint to the place where you use the decrypted key and dump they might scan your code for patterns which show that you are using a known crypto algorithm algorithms have precalculated etc why you need to make the whole software executable hard to for this you use executable running code in a virtual integrity checks all this is to slow down debugging and modifying your most people here point out you stop just slow them go to a cracker forum and ask there for suggestions about key hiding they are most likely helpful if you ask public key crypto hide the key any but it might make it harder theoretically to make a key if doing a licensing

just started learning common rapidly falling in love with just moved onto the type i seem to be developing a particular fondness for applicative i understand in cl strings and lists are both but there seem to be any standard functions for mapping over a only i can see why they would be supplied for what with them being the fundamental datatype and but why was it not designed to work with as they are a more general it would seem more useful to target applicative functions at them rather than or am i completely misunderstandimatifying how it i was feeling particularly confused about was the way that sequences the abstraction and lists an implementation seem to be muddled up in the consensus seems to be that this is for historical lisp has been around so long that you can pretty much map out the development of software engineering practices through its functions and which functions apply to sequences and which to lists seems arbitrary at first glance because cl has a mixture of functions that operate only on and functions that do the same thing in a more general way on as someone who is just learning cl at the i think it would be useful if authors introduced sequences first as the cleaner and then bought in lists as the most fundamental implementation of that lists would still be needed as syntax of but by the time it is necessary to state this explicitly many readers would have worked this out by which would be quite an ego boost when starting programming and common lisp

listening to the framework guidelines for once actually helps plenty of material in the book is just plain elements of java style yet again in redmond should avoid similar type names in cross or mixing namespaces mixing across domains and models in generial even in one that is extremellly strict and it also has an incarnation in resolution and compiler crashes and even fully qualifying all the time is no btw aliases and are extremely limited and cause mild duplication at as well as prove weakness in generic programming etc my data domain types are a primary target for a more appropriate and thus for name refactoring which cheap a process in rich asts but simple support like in in ide and feel powerful according to dynamic ruby also be read dynamic features sheep will blame everyone but not think about namespaces or functional or similar communicates the semantics better the intent plumbing support to build your own processing usually of primitive but typed nature or message typed not critique as in aforementioned book which itself breaks straight out of intro lifts all to reference and becomes a useful artifact in usage is actually possible and quite programming really are no rules but beware that you will see mixing of namespaces in development when least which means only one thing for a plus somewhat less more and intellinonsense errors of problem in all so it is your even tool vendors can mess up for machines to say output of enhanced popular ides based on outdated browse then others do it real well for managed that i am against duplicating there are cases are tough but when mixing dual interop representation etc other models where same name makes it more where duplication is a necessity of but that is lower level idioms that is not friendly or encouraging of in favour of

looks like trying to port from ruby to if it might be easier to use a native memcache client implementation such i generally agree with markusq that translating from a language to a language is probably going to be less productive overall than just rewriting in an idiomatic fashion for the target a straight translation from ruby to is going to give you some very ugly at yield ruby keyword allows you to invoke a block of code that was passed as an implicitly declared argument to the for you can think of the method definition as actually looking more ttl when you call as stuff in the braces gets assigned to the variable block in the expanded definition yield then invokes the code in this is a gross but should help you get the general to your the simplification i just did necessarily going to get you because as soon as you find a way to translate that another piece of code will break your for say a given method needs to inspect the if no arguments load defaults from config file and ignore of course since lambdas are objects in you may encounter code like the lambda a b c foo is now defined as a function that sums its three then god help you if you encounter code that defines methods on the or fo a takes advantages of malleable def puts prints def puts prints prints still prints each instance of each class in ruby can have its own class not really sure how you would port even simple examples to without fancy ruby has a lot of these features that will break a simple translation so i would recommend learning the thing trying to and then redoing it from

makes sense to use a pointer to a pointer whenever the pointer actually points towards a pointer chain is hence etc are reason for creating such code is because you want the to be able to properly check the types you are using mystery dont have to use such types you can always simply use a simple and typecast whenever you need to actually dereference the pointer and access the data that the pointer is directing but that is usually bad practice and prone to errors certainly there are cases where using void is actually good and making code much more think of it more like your last its mostly for helping the compiler to make sure things are used the way they are supposed to be

my using vhdresizer and diskpart on a windows xp vhdresizer from these instructions from on this didnt on entering not sure on the exact wording but it was along the lines of cant extend this easiest way to do this long as you have enough hard drive is to extend your existing vhd using vhd expander which gives you two vhd the newly extended file will take the name of your existing you might want to and compact your vhd prior to extending your virtual pc 2007 go to your vhd as hard disk your newly extended vhd as hard disk your an command execute list select your new vhd volume by executing select volume where is your new vhd most likely execute you should see a success if not you may have to recreate your extended vhd due to an error in the by typing down the both vhd files from the hard disks your newly extended vhd as hard disk your will get a windows newly added hardware message after a short the vm when using your newly extended is information on extending volumes using the image virtual and virtual diskpart and expand the virtual disk disk 3 the number in the list part part 1 the number in the list part the new and save changes virtual and virtual can get download virtual server can do a custom install and only select more using with windows is not possible to use you can only use reason for this is that vhdmount uses vds virtual disk to assign a disk letter to the virtual hard disk after it is but vds is only included in windows server 2003 and this is not too big of an issue as unlike windows server windows xp will automatically mount the virtual hard disk when it is plugged this means that the only functionality you lose on windows xp is the ability to specify exactly which drive letter should be	
my which is javascript and jquery but also uses master pages and ajax i am consistently seeing on the status bar of ie 6 occasionally ie the message items or items followed by this message never goes away and may or may not prevent some page functionality from running certainly seems to bog but not can cause this to happen of the time by just refreshing an but the number of items the file it mentions usually it is or googled for answers and there are several suggestions or some of them worked for and others practical for us to implement or are some of the caching images so it repeatedly asks for the same image if the image is repeated on the page and the server assumes that it should be cached locally since already served it in that page ie displays the images but sits and waits for a server response that never typically the file it says it is waiting on is repeated on the page is using png graphics with indeed it but they are themeroller generated graphics according to the are ie the components are the only things using all of our png references are in if that changed some of the graphics from png to but it is just as likely to say waiting for as it is for are being specified in css javascript but are on things that currently being displayed none items for this be but if it then i would think preloading images would but so adding a preloader do any caching policy is confusing the if this is it is only microsoft server sw having problems with browser surprise me at i have much control over the iis configuration that will be hosting the anyone seen this and found a way to combat particularly on apps with jquery and other data on at least one of the just commenting out the datepicker component setup causes the problem to go but i think at least not if that fixes all of the if it does have to swap out because that functionality needs to be there seem to be any open issues against on checked the iis settings and content was set on any of my unchecking that setting was a common suggestion for fixing this have page that i can consistently create the error using the file also tried with the same the problem only occurs when i refresh the page that contains the if i comment out the datepicker the problem goes here are a few things i notice when i do page always says item downloading picture but only when i look at http i see that it requests that image from the server every time it is dynamically turned without regard to of the requests for that graphic are complete and return the graphic none are marked code 200 or 304 that the server is telling ie to use the cached why it says waiting on that graphic when all of the requests have completed i have no is a single other graphic on the page of the ui png that has a code 304 on another page where i managed to log http traffic with items two different graphic files ui had a 304 as well neither was the one listed as error is not innocuous the page is not fully for if i click on one of the buttons which should execute a the page away from the page and coming back does not produce the have moved the script and script references to the bottom of the content and this affect this the script is still running in the though too hairy to divide out unless i absolutely have update and were a lot of good answers and suggestions but none of them were exactly our the closest one the one that led me to the was the one about long running so i awarded the bounty there guess i could have answered it but rather reward info that leads to was our we had multiple jqueryui datepickers that were created on the event in script included from the master on this client a local event had script that destroyed the datepickers under certain we had to use because the previous version of datepicker had a problem with when we upgraded to the latest version of jquery ui and replaced the with for the the problem went away mostly went away if you do things too fast while the page is it is still possible to get the items theory as to what was happening goes like page content loads and has 12 text boxes with the master page script on those text queues up requests for graphic ie know how cache dynamic the requests get client area script datepickers so the no longer is left with some number requests that it what to do have ideas for solving the items problem on internet

ok to require if to have an else if it makes it easier for scheme supports returning multiple values from a so if you were to implement the return values as a you could have an empty list signify that no return value was make sure eval returns a important distinction not returning an empty list if there was no else the empty list signifies that there was no return if there were one return value from an expression it was you would have as the return from the eval behind the returning multiple values from an expression would cause the eval return list to have multiple in all you could really return if the condition fails and no because it would be an error in a program to attempt to capture the value of a function that return as it would be the job of the not the to catch this

on your if that it may be helpful to post your code for to see how the saving is taking response to your second if i understand it this is how nhibernate treats mapped mapped the collection as so loading the object will load all the elements of the collection at the same when you first access the collection nhibernate will query the database to fill the collection and return when you first do something countries country in will silently execute a query similar from country where then build a collection of country objects to return cache so that the query is not run through the mapping file already told nhibernate all about your two entities and and how they are related so it knows how to build the queries to access the it keeps track of what was in the collection so when you add or remove it can compare what was changed and execute the appropriate insert or remove the way to use collections mapped by nhibernate is to use them just as you would with a normal add and remove items at your just when you are make sure you tell nhibernate to persist the changes you made to the either by calling or on every item you or you have set like you simple call on the parent object that contains the

only way to answer your question is to give pros and cons for each design going for is best when there is minimal for stateless data examples for procedural processing would all kinds of mathematical string array direct memory access and the is great for state it is great to use oop for things like ui elements of textbook socket programming other protocol implementations also anything that involves and implements itself is a common practice to mix functions for simple processing with complex state controls in methods in classes would be using functions for their internal data something together might work for the but after multiple upgrades you might end up looking for spaghetti sauce for your it is always good to have a deliberate design for the code as opposed to aspect is the practice in the if it is a common practice in zend framework to have mixed implementations and functional for simple there is little reason not if it is better stick with one otherwise you will face maintainability issues and other people will have to spend hours and days understanding your is also necessary to explore every bit of of doing whatever you compiler opposed to and linking is make sure there are no problems your code is split into modules be sure to check that mixing things will not break there are performance quantify once you decision might become many test applications to verify your choices unexpected slow start data jumping over hoops to get things done all indicate that the choice is not knowing is as important as knowing

previously used a not in the xp but in the sense that every task has a coder and a reviewer nominated before the coding the coder and reviewer work together identifying the correct solution so the reviewer knows what is meant to be done to perform the work is done in a branch by a single coder trunk and check in until the work has passed and a diff is generated for the whole if using something brain dead like a checkout per task is needed so changes for each task are if using something less brain dead not strictly the branch method works best because then the reviewer can generate their own diffs off the branch and no need to email them around you can check in works in progress without destroying the main a required state to your work flow in the issue tracker called one called when the dev has finished reviewing the code they can add their comments to the issue tracker and forward the ticket back to the developer for rework or merging depending on whether it worked if it worked well set it to the integration state and if it was bad put it back to process has worked reasonably well in all the places seen it

problem with pointers is not the the execution and language additional confusion results when teachers assume that the concept of pointers and not the or the convoluted mess c and makes of the so vast amounts of effort are poored into explaining the concept in the accepted answer for this and pretty much just wasted on someone like because i already understand all of just explaining the wrong part of the give you an idea of where coming someone who understands pointers perfectly and i can use them competently in assembler because in assembler language they are not referred to as they are referred to as when it comes to programming and using pointers in i make a lot of mistakes and get really i still have not sorted this let me give you an an api is a pointer to the does it could number representing an address to a give it do i say or number representing the address to an address to a that or or number representing the address to the address to the address to the or is it or even so and the language involved make it as clear because it involves the words and that hold as much meaning and clarity to me as holds the address to and function requires an address to the answer additionally depends on just what the heck is to begin and what doit intends to do with the language support the levels of nesting that are encountered in like when i have to hand a in to a function that creates a new and it modifies the pointer to point at the new location of the does it really want the or a pointer to the so it knows where to go to modify the contents of the most of the time i just have to guess what is meant by and most of the time regardless of how much experience i get at is just too is a pointer an address to a or is it a variable that holds an address to a when a function wants a does it want the address that the pointer variable or does it want the address to the pointer

question to ask why do i need to write this it doing for the method a more what i can the method takes in an a string and a the method is then expected to return a dataset containing a solitary table with 3 first row contains values like column second row of which contains the this method should be create known inputs int i string a hashtable with some call the method and obtain the resulting query the dataset to see if it has the single table with 2 inspect the contents of the records of the table to see if they contain the header row and the row with to above except that you pass in null for the hashtable all i could see based on the snippet you not sure what you mean here by or test fixture code for the hashtable is just a parameter to your so i reckon the test would look something like this the bad naming and lack of name them unless i know what this function is used for in real void int intval string stringval string expectedhashvalue hashtable ht new dataset ds check header similar to row2 as shown datarow row2 recommend getting a good book like pragmatic unit testing in with nunit or one from the list to speed you up	
question you have to ask yourself do the two sections of code logically fit together as one deployment if keep them in the same if separate be i would create a new project for the namespace it just seem to work that way in think about whether want to access the namespace from the one and vice versa if they would reasonably reference each then they should be in the same

rails app i am developing currently has about 35 migrations up to this since the application started as an there is a fair amount of meaningless churn in the migrations as i went back and forth between different there any drawbacks to collapsing migrations into one i was planning to do this by having the first migration load the schema as it is now and deleting all the previous am currently the only person working on this if that makes a it a good idea to collapse old rails	
random thoughts sure i can fully answer sync is one i had a chance to fully appreciate what it can do once deployed it after the initial first time seems to work a msdn site for it can execute scripts on a mobile but not through something like sql management so in theory you could scripts but the down side is that the would be convoluted supported and i know a way to execution but the sync framework might hold some

reading a book that describes the syncroot it compares to the syncroot syncroot new i really understand the difference it seems that in both cases both methods can only be accessed by one thread at a book describes because the object of the instance can also be used for synchronized access from the outside and you control this form the class you can use the syncroot of the anyone tell me the difference between the two approaches in the use of the syncroot

reading your question this is a fairly common and well support by django you can use the same form for both scenarios you say the item to be commented has the primary key you would build a link for the user to click with a url that looks like on would work just as well with a slug though see the comment below about how the identifier must match the id in the view would pick up the and pass it on to the form in the form form will be displayed with the for this example to of the parameter must match whatever the choice identifier is for the item field built automatically off a model as it that will probably be the primary key of the available this i mean if the choices were to look the should be 1 or 2 as what will be in the resulting options automatically created modelform classes will take care of this for otherwise just be can find more information here in the django initial	
real if you kill a process instant no chance to clean windows reboots often close a program by sending it a but it always work for whatever if your program delays for very the user if he wants to save before for the shutdown code will kill the if you want to guarantee that always call that event have to guarantee that you never use a modal dialog box or anything else that would block the program from immediately bailing out when it receives this is probably more trouble than alternative would be to do something similar to what firefox write the status data out to a temporary file while still and then when it check to see if that there and if the data indicates still in an if your program can know that its last incarnation got killed somehow and take whatever action is such as updating the status log whatever with the last available

really are a couple things going on first thing you should look at is something like a compilers there are several old like the famous that are very i just discovered another one from the same guy who wrote the of assembly language on to write great only read the sample chapters so but it looks good and also seems to address just what you want without dropping immediately into the wonders of grammars and so is more programming in a systems programming you learn about using various system calls and other stuff to build useful you need to know that but a different track than it computer organization like the one aaronis refers is more about how the program gets from the assembly language level to actual gates and also called as the phrase was used when and brooks invented the instruction how and how you make quantitative choices in the design of the

reason being that i suspect most people are taught to implement it using a class and a the following haskell sortby compare sortby sortby the strategy pattern in and are the concrete strategies in this case plain old and the function signature a is the strategy brevity of this illustrates that design patterns have to be so heavyweight or the way you want to implement strategy in java is a good a way that works around java giving you the wrong abstractions for the job you need to this should be considered normal or that assuming my assumption about the way taught is i like the strategy pattern very are some of other patterns which are also specific instances of the general i like them very much for very much the same

site has many style sheets customized for varying screen as the browser is the event checks that a resize actually took place by looking at if it it turns on successively larger style sheets until scrollbars it turns them off in reverse order until scrollbars scrollbars are detected by comparing offsetwidth to two new problems confound detection of a onresize fires whenever scrollbars appear or and reports the width without a break from ie7 and all other my site now frequently gets trapped in a loop in which the onresize logic activates a larger style which creates which then triggers another resize event that cannot be filtered out because the clientwidth has changed due to scrollbars appearing or this would be a trivial fix if ie8 had something like outerwidth i could can i detect if the window really resized in ie8 standards

so a array is just a grouping of useful if got a lot of and you like to save time and the same as now the computer knows what talking about and you can write something to n a two dimensional array is somewhat more but can be thought of as an array of so we could have something like of of of equivalent declaration in pascal to the above a array is a so for if arraya contains the grades of a student in 50 then arrayb represents the grades of a bunch of would be the grade of the third student on class number easy to expand the same logic to add another dimension to the of could say that c represents a so is the grade of the second schools fourth student in class what are arrays used storing groups of similar or information need to be processed in in mostly be using a at most dimensional if you can imagine your data as a almost definitely want an for how else would you represent a chess if you had arrays tend to be used but what if you had to save some sort of state for each of your table something of the third value is 1 if some condition is true for a given and 0 of a trivial but another way of understand arrays more	
solution i liked was adopted from the create a which implements i will try and find a link but an example for how to get a safe this solution does not require the this is just how he solves the problem which i find really class safedatareader gets an integer from the returns 0 for public int return gets an integer from the returns 0 for public int if return return public object object val if return return public where int index if return return new ok so how do we use this safe data so assume we have a cmd object which is all using mycolumn was null this will still work because a string can be null string this case myint will be set to 0 if mycolumn is int can also use the getnullable method that is not part of his and not sure where it came but it looks correct to portable is well since it is implementing idatareader it should be very and should be able to be swapped in and out so long as the calling code expect to be	
solution in is a solution using the extension result keystring str is no linq syntax for the aggregate clause in apparently there is in for some predefined solution might look somewhat but the aggregate method is quite aggregate works like if you have a you can combine all values into a aggregate is in contrast to the which modify the length of the or the which does shrink the but it still remains a list of a single if you have a list you can combine them into a single value like xs sum sumsofar you give two values to the a seed value and a start aggregating with a single seed value in this combiner function gets called for each value in the first argument is the computed result so far the first later this will have other and it combines it with the value in short how the method works on it works the same on but just with different

spot on that you want some sort of case classes to model your in functional languages these sorts of things are called data and you can read all about how haskell uses them by googling around a equivalent of adts uses sealed traits and case look at a of the json parser from the scala standard library or the programming in scala instead of using to represent json and instead of using any to represent arbitrary json it uses an abstract data to represnt json has several representing the possible kinds of json and json data of this form involves pattern since the jsvalue is the compiler will warn you if you dealt with all the for the code for a method that takes a and returns a representation of that looks like def string x match case jsnull case case s case case case matching both lets us make sure dealing with every and also the underlying value from its it provides a way of knowing that handled every if you know at the structure of the json data dealing you can do something really cool like very powerful check it	
sql aggregate functions are not what you want to do is follow patterns like the sharded counters which explain that instead of aggregating the values on you want to keep the counters up to date when the values are or example takes the concept a bit further than just maintaining the aggregates in that it will explain how to make it so that you can update the counters under high load where you have a limited amount of opportunity to write to your counters so the shards help you distribute the load over several

subversion all others are not source code control managers always thought scm means software configuration but version control means they store changes to the stuff you store in it have to be source it could be image bitmap configuration files or all kinds of only 1 reason why built binaries be considered as part of this and because you can rebuild think why you would want to store the released binaries in there as its a system to assist not to tell you how you should build your make the computer work for instead of against so what if storing binaries takes up space you have hundreds of gigabytes of disk space and super fast its not a big deal to store binary objects in there anymore ten years ago it might have been a problem this is perhaps why people think of binaries in scm as a bad as a you might be comfortable with using the system to rebuild any version of an but the others who might use it might this means need an alternative system to store the and you already have such a its your make use of you assume that you rebuild from obviously you store all the source code in but you store the the the and the other dependant bits that are what happens when someone comes along and asks you build me the version we shipped 2 years a customer has a problem with that 2 years is an eternity do you even have the same compiler you used back what happens when you check all the source out only to find that the newly updated sdk is incompatible with your source and fails with do you wipe your development box and reinstall all the dependencies just to build this can you even remember what all the dependencies last point is the big to save a few k of disk you might cost yourself days if not weeks of law also says that whichever app you need to rebuild will be the one that required the most difficult to set up dependency you were ever glad to get rid store the binaries in your worry over we stick all binaries in their own directory per then when we want to update a we use a special project that consists of nothing but you export the setup project and done as it fetches the right things and puts them into the right directory

takes less time to produce code than i say i mean with comments that communicate your intention clearly at every typing comments takes some and your coworkers should all be smart enough to figure out what you intended just by reading your descriptive function and variable names and spelunking their way through all your executable but it takes more of their time to do it than if you had just explained your and clear documentation is especially helpful when the logic of the code turns out to be not that code would ever be firmly believe that if you time it from when you start a project to when you ship a writing code takes less for one having to explain clearly what doing forces you to think it through and if you write a concise explanation of what your code is accomplishing then probably not designed and for another purely selfish and code is far easier to dump onto someone else to maintain thus freeing the original author to go create the next big i rarely if ever have to stop what doing to explain how my code was meant to work because blatantly obvious to anyone who can read english if they read and one more reason my memory just that i recall what i had for breakfast much less what i was thinking when i wrote code a month or a year perhaps your memory is far better than but because i document my intentions i can quickly pick up wherever i left off and make changes without having to first figure out what i was thinking when i wrote why i document well not because i feel some noble calling to produce pretty code fit for and not because a but simply because it lets me ship quality software in less

the question of cluttering the code when demonstrating a coding i think the question do you choose to handle the error in your example is to what do you do fatal for one application is for if i retrieve some info from a webserver it a 404 error or a that may be fatal if you do anything without that but if that data is supplementary to what then perhaps you can live without the above may point to simply logging the better than ignoring the error but i think often the difficulty is in knowing when to recover from an perhaps a whole new tutorial in

they are not necessarily consumed in the same the pattern is a way of providing to future you are telling person objects must have a social security a trivial example but it gets the idea across strategy pattern allows possible implementations to be switched in and it is not implemented through but instead by letting the caller pass in the desired an example might be allowing a shippingcalculator to be provided with one of several different ways of calculating taxes nosalestax and a percentagebasedsalestax implementation the will actually tell the object which strategy to as the client would never do that for an object that was based on template in the client might not even know an object is based on template those abstract methods in the template method pattern might even be in which case the client even know they

thing you could do if you have the disk space is create a second table with the correct clustered index copy the rows over over to the new table over several days via an incremental once all the rows are there execute on both tables would require just a few minutes of if your apps were referencing a view instead of the physical table you could have this done with zero downtime to your i hope this also have to deal with the update to the you need to have a or last updated field available on the source table so that you can sync the updates once you have all the rows copied	
think a better way to handle this would be using the to decorate your controller a base this would give you the option to do logging or handle errors in different controllers with different errors by extending this attribute and modifying it to fit your say by changing the view that gets using this attribute uses the standard filter processing in mvc and builds the page using views rather than writing directly to the response as you might do using

think a simple for instance on the platform implements connection pooling by so it will automatically adjust a of connections and them so not constantly creating and destroying expensive say you were writing a data collection application that monitored 200 separate input every time one of those inputs you fire off a thread that records the event to the i would say that could be a bad design if a chance that even a fraction of those could fire off at the same suddenly having 20 or 40 active database connections is it might be better to queue the and as long as there are updates left in the a singleton connection picks them off the queue and executes them on the more efficient because you only have to negotiate the connection and authentication once no activity for a while you could choose to close down the this kind of behavior would be hard to implement without a central resource manager like a

think has the words of concentrate on the identify and deliver then move on to the next and the this is called and incremental response to the weaknesses of the waterfall will also allow you to create tools and frameworks which should make your development easier and faster as you move will allow you to show your clients functional parts but a word of your client will more than likely keep changing its changing the changing its seen entire projects fail due to these continuous it is out of the scope of this question to mention any more on but please be aware that it more than likely will happen and be prepared to deal with you and the client have functional they can be tested immediately rather than testing one huge completing functional parts iteratively will probably allow you to work at every on most using most tools and the advantage of this is that it will allow you to identify the complexities it is those complex areas that render this following statement first of the code accounts the first of the development the remaining of the code for the other of the acknowledging and understanding those complex areas will allow you to manage your risks and alter your efforts and resources more

to insight that i could put the code to store the selection in another i was able to create a solution using as stated in the comments to mousedown fires after the selectedvaluechange so i has to use mouseup here is the handle the selectedvaluechanged revert the selection if there are too many sending event void eventargs listbox listbox sender as the number of selected items is greater than the number the user is allowed to if this method from running while reverting the the selection to the previously stored for index index if catch catch this method as an event handler for the selection change handle the mouseup store the selection sending event method saves the state of selection of the list box into a class this is used by the selectedvaluechanged handler such that when the user selects more items than they are allowed it will revert the selection to the state saved here in this mouseup which is the state of the selection at the end of the mouse we have to use the mouseup event the selectedvaluechanged event is called multiple times when a is the first time it fires the item that was is the next time the rest of the items intended by the are thus using selectedvaluechanged handler to store the selection state would fail in the the user is allowed to select 2 items the user clicks the selectedvaluechanged the max has not been selection call it which contains the user and item 2 lines down from the first selection called the selectedvaluechanged the selection shows that only line1 and line3 hence the max has not been selection stored call it which contains the selectedvaluechanged fires this time and line3 are hence the max has been exceeded so we revert to the previously stored which is what we wanted was to revert to the mousedown event fires after the first selectedvaluechanged hence saving the state in mousedown also stores the state at the wrong private void mouseeventargs if listbox listbox sender as the current foreach selectedindex in

viewstate is an object graph which is built in parallel to the control so these kinds of changes tend to have the side effects it could be argued you are essentially hijacking the controls object and giving it a different which is not really the intention of override is for providing a different mechanism to accomplish the same meaning or child controls of one of my is not the same as child are better ways to accomplish what one could be to explicitly expose a property on your control which is the users should add their controls if the intent is for this to be a complex which has one customizable then expose that area as	
virtual call has to check for being null and a virtual call does so i see in generally why a virtual calls would be in special cases the compiler jit be able to inline the virtual call better then a as a compiler has access to better type the call method instruction be slower in as the jit may be able to use a quicker instruction that only copes with a small offset as it know more about the runtime memory layout and processor model then a we are talking about a handful of processor instruction at most on a modem superscalar it is very possible that the instruct is run at the same time as the and therefore takes no is also very likely that all the processor instructions will already in be the level 1 cache if the call is make in a but the data is less likely to be the cost of reading a data value from main memory these days is the same as running 100s of instructions from the level 1 therefore it is unlucky that in real applications the cost of a virtual call is even measurable in more then a very few fact that the code uses a few more instructions will of course reduce the amount of code that can fit in the the effect of this is impossible to

was a really good discussion on this over at last it answers your question pretty are pretty straightforward just remember the and xxx import are executable they when the running program reaches that a module is not in then an import creates the new entry in and then executes the code in the it does return control to the calling module until the execution has a module does exist in then an import simply returns module whether or not it has completed that is the reason cyclic imports may return modules which appear to be partly the executing script runs in a module named the script under its own name will create a new module unrelated that lot together and you get any surprises when

was wondering about the basis of the question because i thought it was easy to however as soon as you go it becomes clear that its actually a good question because pretty much the first thing on the page is this specification defines the features and syntax for the extensible stylesheet language a language for expressing it consists of two language for transforming xml vocabulary for back in the real xslt is also what most people will assume you mean by is a means for transforming xml documents into something else that something else more often than not being another well structured document probably also formatted as xml used xslt to render xml to csv and on the other hand is about formatting about laying out content on a page or a sequence of pages in a fairly strict its useful because it allows you to manage content that is spread across multiple its relatively straightforward to specify the format of a page even and odd including etc and have your content flow into one would therefore take a load of data an xml format and then use xslt to convert that data into a document consisting of that in turn is rendered using an appropriate tool in say pdf for print or other means of use case i have is to take a pile of tabular export that data as render that into and from there to pdf which goes to a printer who turns said pdf into a 500 page one specifies in the that one wants page page breaks in specific that there is a table of contents and an index based on particular and the rendering process handles filling in the page numbers across the a bit less confused

we need to know what you already know about the you have a username and an old what else do you do you have an email do you have data regarding the favorite you have a password and working email you need to add two fields to your user table it is a database a date called and a string you have the email when someone requests a password you update the user table as some number of some random string of characters you send an email to the user at that has requested a new password for user account at website if you did request this password follow this that link does not work you can go to and enter the following into the you did not request a password you may ignore this yada coding this script needs a if the var update passed on the the form just asks for the username and email if update is not it asks for email and the id code sent in the you also ask for a new password of verify the new you verify the email and the id code all that the request has not and that the two new passwords if you change the password to the new password and clear the password reset fields from the user also be sure to log the user any login related cookies and redirect the user to the login the field is a password that only works on the password reset potential you could remove from the has request a password reset for an account at this email thus making the username something only the user knows if the email is i start off that way because if someone is attacking the they already know the this added obscurity stops attacks of opportunity in case someone malicious happens to intercept the for your the random it need to be extremely any guid generator or even is where salt is something on the user record like timestamp account was it has to be something the user you need this just to keep your database no more than a week is really necessary but at least 2 days since you never know how long an email delay might since the email could be delayed by ip address is only useful for not for if you want to log do otherwise you need see that covers good

what do you plan on doing with this is a windbg which can get you this if you need code to do scripting the debugger will probably be much more reliable to get this return this information to you on its since it has no idea why user mode code requested the you need to use it with other information sources to get this and there may still be some error you should filter only by memory and static allocations been should fall within that allocations should be at an address with a loaded you can use psapi to determine if the address is within a loaded for calling enumprocessmodules and then you can use the toolhelp api to determine if the memory location is in a createtoolhelp32snapshot with to get threads in the target then getthreadcontext and check if the resulting stack pointer is within the know of a good way to walk heaps from outside the toolhelp snaps a heap list but give you a good set of bounds for the heap from within the you can use getprocessheaps to walk the list of and then call heapvalidate to dtermie if the memory location is within the

what i understand of just reading the bugzilla the bug manifests when two distinct problems hash algorithm generates collisions for urls that are from the bug seems to mean every 4 characters perhaps the urls are the logic for dealing with hash collisions fails because they flushed the previous url with the same hash value to disk if you have a page with two very similar urls this might happen on some versions of it generally happen on different i would since then ff will have time to flush the entries to disk avoiding the timing if you have multiple resources that are all loaded from the same make sure they have a run of 9 characters that are completely one way you might ensure this is by appending a querystring you with a random bit of something

while back a post by jon skeet planted the idea in my head of building a for using in a loop instead of idea is that the portion of a call to spent parsing the format string is we be able to improve performance by moving that code outside of the the of is that the new code has to match the week i finally did i actually went through using the framework source provided by to do a direct adaption of their parser turns out actually farms the work to the code i came up with in that my results are accurate within my test i still have one in my initial tests the performance of my code closely matches that of the normal no improvement at even consistently a few milliseconds at least still in the same order the amount slower it stays within a few milliseconds even as the test set but i was hoping for something possible that the internal calls to are what actually drive the but like to see if the smart people here can improve on things is the relevant class public int of item in the argument means a literal from the original format public data from original format public string format to use with supplied argument for for format public int means it should be at least 7 characters public bool would use opposite data is all populated by the parts new int basesize string iformatprovider formatprovider icustomformatter customformatter the code in here very closely matches the code in the could it be string if null args throw new var sb new foreach fi in if throw new if throw new object arg string s if s if if is s else if s if s int pad if pad if pad return implementation comparative my own test call i use but useful to how my format method string return wary of providing the source code for my because not sure of the licensing implications from my reliance on the original anyone who wants to test this can just make the relevant private data public and assign values that mimic a particular format very open to changing the class and even the list if anyone has a suggestion that could improve the build since my primary concern is iteration time from front to end maybe a linkedlist would fare something else i can try is adjusting my my benchmarks were fairly composing names to a format and composing formatted phone numbers from the area and extension neither of those have much in the way of string as i think about how the original state machine parser i think those string literals are exactly where my code has the best chance to do well because i no longer have to examine each character in the class is still even if i make it go as long as performance is than the base still created a interface that allows a program to assemble own at run all i need to do is provide public access to the parts comparing to

will soon work on a project about a mobile application will work on a pdt with windows mobile and we will use visual studio and to developp application will intensively use wifi and need to consume as little power as found on the internet a lot of stuff concerning embedded software and real time which deal with power but this stuff is very hardware and does not talk about software also found some interesting best practices but that mainly focus on the code of the application close handles as soon as possible or use few would like to know if you are aware of some leads concerning the architecture or the design of such also saw advice about the use of event driven is it so useful concerning power saving and is it usable with the compact framework for your so dave gave us some that we could call architecture i think i see clearly what could be done at two differents a such decisions as a low level of close to the tricks and tips that minimize the battery about at a middle level of abstraction the design is there some methodology for software design what so to design a less power consuming mobile

with the rainbow what you need to know about secure password touches on this it starts out with a about people misunderstanding rainbow tables and the actual level of danger they but then turns into a good discussion of the implications of password hashing algorithm your final the more direct answer is by examining the output you can only determine the number of bits in the output of the final hashing depending on the this may or may not be if the any there be any detectable patterns that will identify it say because the output of will look the same as the end result of since the last step is the same in both anyone who can steal your password database can probably steal your source code as so they can just look at your source to see what your algorithm is and duplicate it for their attacks on your

working on a project that has to connect to some ancient webservices that pack some hierarchical data for requests and responses into single strings of hierarchical been using to generate xsds from sample request and response xml modifying them where necessary to be the best possible and using again to generate the managers that call the webservices can then take those request objects as serialize them to strings in order to make the get the responses back as deserialize them into the response objects and return i a list of i can have a valid xsd that considers it a complex type of an unbounded of and then it will deserialize simply to a string which is nice and simple to deal the annoying problem is that for some there seem to be any way to get it to call the string array anything other than no matter i add to the i get to write any other an example xsd the resulting partial class accountstatusrequest private public items get return set tried adding pretty much every attribute in intellisense to both the choice and the inner and nothing makes a for the sake of i added a couple extra similar choices to that to see if that would force it to use a name for the string but instead it gave me really want it to have to be an array of its own type that only holds a but i also really want to leave it called without xml comments anyone know how to add those to an when it should have a more descriptive and i definitely just change it manually as the desired workflow whenever the webservice schemas change is to change the xsds and then the classes from seems like another one of those things should is there something should i take a different approach or is there an alternative tool i can use for this instead less can i get arrays to have a name other than when generating code from an xsd

working on the backend for a flash game and i need to the data going into the game is going to be hosted on many sites in a banner the user will play the game in the advert then click through to the main site to save their the moment i am thinking along the lines of plays the game and clicks to submit their the the banner sends the score and the originating domain to a script on the main script check the domain is one of the valid domains the ad is being hosted everything is the script creates a hash of this score and domain and stores it in the database along side the script returns the hash to flash which cobbles it onto the querystring of a geturl which opens the main scoreboard page checks the referer to make sure it is one of the valid it is it then checks the database for the hash to if a valid user then fills in their details and the record is updated based on the time i checked flash send referer which kinda throws a spanner into my is there an already established pattern for this kind of sort of should i use in step what is the correct name for this kind of is it a a checksum or something understand that being a clientside flash will never actually be that but in my something like the above is about as dificult as going to make it to hack this kind of my main objective is to make it harder for people to find the url of the script that adds the score to the database and simply spam it with fake fraudulent submission to a

would appreciate it if you had some pseudocode on this but just following it over i interfaces for the data access objects that directly access the this way you can pass in an object that only pretends that it accesses the this object would then return results consistent with the results your database would without actually doing any db your object could also simulate scenarios such as rolling back data to its original each into a single method that is the essence of a if your method is 500 lines long then there must be contiguous blocks in there that can be write a unit test for if your unit test is testing too that probably means your method is doing too you can extract methods by identifying the different things you are testing and then putting them in their own rinse and repeat until you only need one test for each on to other sounds like a code a transaction in and by itself should only be one contiguous if you need different users to finish your doing too keep track of your state on the db in terms of flags or not in terms of a db	
would argue that for most programmers and does not present a significant advantage or potential over standard multithreaded most people have threads to accomplish sequential and there that much potential for splitting up those threads to much smaller most benefits of would come from improvements to underlying frameworks database gui and 3d and the vast majority of developers would benefit future static analysis tools may be able to recommend pieces that could be split further into

would consider using a approach for all the extended essentially you define your static data from year over this will be things like company the definition of an address for example change year after these will be modled you would define a table that will contain a master of all the questions you and will be linked somehow to tell you what year those questions are valid this table might also indicate other attributes about the question that could let you dynamically create a gui on top of things such as regular expressions to validate the type of data a really naive approach which even after doing this would not be the end state of what i would model would probally have another table the correlates a year to a and this is what i would link the company this way we can reuse questions over and i have a picture to go along with tihs need to find a place to upload it edit soon as i get that	
would download the following agent agent the tool to improve code quality and speed up is not but it is worth the money download create a test is class myobject new private void integrated with will give you an icon next to each test the icon lets you test the method directly in the ide without you having to start the entire be developers would say that test driven development means that you create the test first and the object after i usually begins with creating the adding the mandatory methods to it and then create the a bit faster and probably start to refactor the class when started to build the you create the spend most of the time document each the documentation should motivate why the method what it expects from the and what it if you describe it most likely have to refactor

would not expose repositories directly to the the first big problem as you mention is you trust the so you cannot expose your data access api to potentially hostile your repositories with services on the server and create a thin delegate layer in the client that handles the remote your entities is not necessarily a bad practice just that it becomes problematic when you start to factor in things like lazy sending data over the wire the client if you write a dto class which wraps one or more entities and delegates calls you can actually build up a dto layer pretty especially using code generation available in most key to all of this is that a set of patterns should really only apply to a part of your not to the whole the fact that you have rich logic in your domain model and use repositories for data access as part of ddd should not influence the client in any conceptually the rias that i build have three uses something like mvp or mvvm to present the the model layer eventually calls i might call the this is a contract of services and data objects that exist on both the client and server to allow the two to usually the ui design drives this layer so that only the data that the client needs is passed to it and data access can be one method call for all the state needed for this set of using whatever it wants to handle business logic and data this might be ddd or something a little more old like a data layer built using stored procs in the db and a lot of or point really is that the client and server are both very different animals and they need to vary in order to do you need a layer inbetween that is a fair compromise between the needs of the ui and the reality of how things might need to be on the one big advantage that and javafx have over flex anything is that you can use a lot of logic in the first two because you have the same vm on both sides of the flex is the best ui technology hands down but it lacks a server component where code could be shared and more

would say that for normal tdd works extremely there are cases where you may not need to write the tests first even at but those are you need to do some exploration to see what will i would consider this to be a and i necessarily think that tdd is absolutely necessary in this i would probably not use the actual code in my after it was just an exploration and now that i have a better idea of how it ought to i can probably write better code than my if i did decide to use my probably go back and write tests for if you find that violated tdd and written some production code before your tests it happens go back and write the in on the occasions where this has happened to me often found things that neglected once i start writing the tests because more tests come to mind that handled by the you get back in the tdd rythym vow never to do that

would suggest the datetime field rather than the autoincrement simply because it will not only serve as an effective sort it also preserves information that you may well want to if you want the most recent first sort using the date and a order by you retrieve the you can retrieve it as a datetime and modify it using you can use as suggested by mdresser if you just wish to show the date or if you wish to show the time as you can also use sql to convert it into a string before retrieving you look in see the various conversion codes is the code used that can be used to translate the date in various you may want to use an autoincrementing field for your application for reasons other than your expressed need to sort wall they are easy to use just mark the field as an if using sql server dbs are as far as using them in your just think of the field as an int field that you never have to why would you use a perhaps the most straightforward reason is so that they give you have an easy way to identify each for if you permit people to alter or delete their wall the field is ideal as it gives you a way to easily look up each record record will be assigned its unique you might put an next to the record like stackoverflow does and make it a call back with the uid note that you should set up your primary key on the uid field if be doing you find them useful for this then you could also sort by the i would still store the date so that you can provide date and time feedback as to when an entry was made on the wall but this would no longer be your indexed or sorted	
would suggest you take a look at the language toolkit and the both are available for free and are great learning	
would suspect the confusion arises over how interfaces were implemented in as abstract classes and multiple and interface is simply a contract that says you will implement those code compile for the same reason this code wont would with interface void abstract class foo is declaring that foo implements it say anything else about you wanted to force derived classes to implement it you would interface void abstract class foo public abstract void if you really wanted the interface methods hidden by explicit then something like n8wrl posted

wrote a winmm library wrapper library that exposes waveout and wavein classes for the purpose of recording and playing raw audio works but in order to follow the operating system specs on how to handle the finished i added a thread that unprepares the buffers and frees the i also got all of the synchronization so that the classes are solid and there seems to be a rare issue where i add a buffer to the waveout device and the operating system returns a success but if the device is reset immediately the os does not mark the buffer as finished and return it to the seems that it is loosing the the problem keeping track of the count of individual buffers sent to the device and blocking joining the function to the thread that cleans them or known this does not seem to happen on a quad core in but does happen on my dual core in xp totally willing to expose the full source once i get it uploaded and propery licensed on if that would help posted library to is an idea of what causes the partial class mainview private wavein wavein new private waveout waveout new public waveformat format new tweaking these values affects the internal buffering setting too small of a queuesize with too small of a will cause buffer which will sound like choppy void datareadyeventargs if lock we have to check for null after the because waveout may have been inside another if private void formclosedeventargs if lock wavein if lock waveout library
