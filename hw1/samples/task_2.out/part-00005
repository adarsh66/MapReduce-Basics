a big because it leads to unmanageable component and most likely some form of build errors and very likely some deployment at some point in the project life studio 2008 explicitly prevents circular references between projects in as you have that is not the case for i believe that is because vs2008 expects that binary references are managed independently and it expects that you are building those projects generally that means all binary references should be viewed as components that represent a distinct relationship your code and the msbuild allows you to use the sln file to build if all your projects use vb or this allows for the creation of an which is ideal for an automated build the catch is that in order for such a master solution file to all of the projects in the sln must utilize project in order to take advantage of by microsoft expects that you are not employing circular since they are explicitly forbidden by the visual studio ide project hanselman makes reference to an file in the following parallel msbuilds from within the visual studio

a mistake to assume that learning c will somehow automatically give you a better understanding of programming in a lot of cases even c is too high level to give you a good understanding of efficiency classic is versus so perhaps most people know the implications about performance between these two but learning c magically teach you this by guess i understand arguments about when string operations are made deceptively people often use them in inefficient but knowing that strncat exists give you a full appreciation for the efficiency a lot of c programmers probably even thought about the fact that strncat has to do a strlen operation using important to understand going on behind the scenes if efficiency is a people who know c tend to view things in a assembly and machine code are the building blocks of while c is a building block of higher level specifically but obvious that c is to the than many higher level this has at least two efficiency concerns as hidden behind implicit and easier to screw you want a specific example of how knowing c gives you an i think there is i think what people when they say this is that knowing going on behind the scenes in whatever language happening to write for helps you make more intelligent decisions about how to write a mistake to assume that c is going on behind the in for

abstraction i mean what should i call them and what kind of icon should i use to represent it in the the concept of tags should be familiar to most users right but not so sure hierarchical tags nor does the abstraction of tags completely i have is actually something between folders and in that each subtag is a proper subset of its to get the contents of a you take its contents plus the contents of its and do that in a way like where i just partially answered my own question in the process of asking what do you guys think of calling them what kind of icon would you give since a category is an abstract concept rather than a physical object that can take a wiki if for what looking for is an abstraction for an like aunt sally that easily grasp the ideally there is also a graphical representation that can be easily associated with that one thing i did forget to mention is that an item can exist in more than on category like how google doc allows you to add an document to multiple i guess kind sold myself on calling them it just fits everything you can do with something can belong to a more than one subcategories make most subcategories people normally create lend themselves to an relationship a windows user might have say a folder called resumes in their my documents because a resume is a it would make sense that in my documents as well if you think of the folders as i still figured out is the icon sure going to be using some kind of treeview to display them i could just use a folder icon i maybe a custom icon unless anyone else has a better google calls them so i guess it be too bad clarify my target audience will be people technical enough to know how to download and install the but about kind of abstraction should i use for hierarchical

add a field to your users table to store the currently used session this id is easily accessible from your when the user logs store that every page check to verify that the current session id matches what was stored in your user if it then clear the current session data and kick the user back to the log in will not stop the user from using multiple tabs in ie 7 because ie7 uses the same instance for each but it will stop them from using multiple browser reason why this will work is that each browser contains own cookie are matched up server side based on a cookie value that stores the session id and is sent back to the server on each this is not a very effective means of eliminating session which it sounds like the security audit is trying to if you need to do update your question and go way to stop session hijacking is to store a random number in the session and as a cookie on the when the next request comes verify that the cookie and session values if they then reset the session id variable in your user this will force all sessions to log in for every page request create a new random the downside is that pages can not be but probably

already initialization lists get completely executed entering the constructor so it is completely safe to use members in the constructor have made a comment in the accepted answer about having to to the constructor but not the member inside the constructor you is possible that you mistook the fact that you refer to parameters and not to member attributes the initialization as an given a class x that has two members and of type the following constructor may be int a a possible problem here is that the construction of the elements in the initialization list depends on the order of declaration in the class and not the order in which you type the initialization if the class were defined int a int int regardless of how you type the initialization list the fact is that will be executed is initialized since the declaration of the members is first and later that will create a bug as your code believes probably on being twice the value of and in fact contains the simplest solution is not refering to the int a a correct regardless of how x is this pitfall is the reason why you are suggested not to use member attributes as part of the initialization of other

are controls that are children of a naming control have their full ids built by appending ids of their parents using in case of a this is necessary to differentiate between multiple instances of the same child control why and not i guess because many people already tend to name their controls and the symbol is as good as the is the right id and why used as a name for controls such as when post back the framework needs to be able to match form keys with appropriate confusion with i comes from the fact that an id you are using inside and the id you see in html are two different the ids are just for whatever when a control gets rendered clientid all get replaced with my guess is that this was done to make it about that you really should try avoiding it whenever findcontrol is a recursive which breaks into and finds gridview2 and asks if it has the as a child the process repeats for each part separated by a side whenever you find yourself calling for some deeply buried you need to examine the pattern and ask for whatever needs to be done with the most likely needs to be done with a as in that it probably needs to be handled on onitemcreated or on where you have access to a row who about

are several problems in the code sample you posted i will address in has been deprecated for quite some time as it can leave dependent variables in inconsistent states in some see sun answer for more a preferred method of stopping and starting a thread is as volatile thread synchronized void runner new synchronized void thread moribund runner void stuff which can be interrupted if your measurements list is accessed by multiple threads event thread and your user at the same time without any it looks like you have to roll your own you can use a you are creating a new socket every iteration of your sending this is a rather heavyweight and only really make sense if you expect measurements to be extremely infrequent one an hour or either you want a persistent socket that is not recreated every loop of the or you want a one shot runnable you can and which creates a sends all relevant and quick note about using a persistent socket methods which such as cannot be interrupted by and so when you want to stop the you must close the socket as well as calling there is little point in throwing your own exceptions from within a thread unless you expect to catch it somewhere a better solution is to log the error and if it is stop the a thread can stop itself with code like the same context as void stuff which can be interrupted if in this case since the loop will exit if you want to be sure a thread exits with the rest of your no matter a good technique is to call after creation and before you start the this flags the thread as a daemon meaning the vm will ensure that it is automatically destroyed if there are no threads running as if your app best practices with regards to threads should ensure that your app hang or slow down the though they can be quite complex

argues that multithreaded gui frameworks are a failed what about does this rule of thumb extend to all is a quote from the article that caught my problem of input event processing is that it tends to run in the opposite direction to most gui in gui operations start at the top of a stack of library abstractions and go i am operating on an abstract idea in my application that is expressed by some gui so i start off in my application and call into gui that call into lower level gui that call into the ugly guts of the and thence into the in input events start of at the os layer and are progressively dispatched the abstraction until they arrive in my application since we are using we will naturally be doing locking separately within each and unfortunately we have the classic lock ordering we have two different kinds of activities going on that want to acquire locks in opposite so deadlock is almost all frameworks be

array is an array of it is not an array of buffers of some if you do will get the sizeof of the first element of that equivalent your array stores in the line that allocate 4 or 8 pointers in one array on how wide a pointer on your platform usually either 4 or but of course not what you wanted to do is create an array of pointers of the same size as you will have to first get the total size of the animals and then divide by the size of one that is what you but the pointers will yet have indeterminate next you pass the array using for the why you can pass taking its address and then dereference is the same as doing nothing in the first in the function you you copy the strings pointed to by elements in to some indeterminate destination the elements of the array the pointers have yet indeterminate we have not assigned them you first have to allocate the right amount of memory and make the elements point to now after this the pointer points to something animal animal no need to dereference the forget to increment animals about the sizeof one important thing you have to be sure the way we calculate the whatever you make sure you always have enough room for your a c string consists of characters and a terminating null which marks the end of the should point to a buffer that is at least as large so that it contains space for animal and the first contains 11 the second depends on what we actually copy over its length is what in total we for all characters including the terminating now not good style to hardcode that number into your the prefix could change and you could forget to update the number or miscount about one or two that is why we use which we provide with the string literal we want to have recall that a expression evaluates to the size of its you use it in to get the total size of your array now you use it for the string all string literals are arrays of string literals consist of the characters you type to the null the following condition because counts the length of a c and does not include the terminating null character to its would have the type of 4 have to divide by the size of one because the sizeof char is one so it make a why do we use instead of because it already accounts for the terminating null and it evaluates at compile the compiler can literally substitute the size that the sizeof expression

can understand the i have been there so share how i keep the basic differences a class method then it using the if you choose to from that keyword is intended to evoke the idea that the method may or may not be the actual method i always think of members as meaning that it represents functionality that can be such as an method on a which might involve eating with a class might override the of in order to allow for an implementation that uses chop sticks because virtual methods and properties are the class that defines that member must provide a complete implementation of the method or all objects must how way of thinking might declare that members represent to is an of a class a may to with chop a class method then it overridden using the if you choose to that keyword is intended to evoke the idea that the class only the capability represented by the and that there is not any common logic that can be generalized for that in other members are only and therefore they lack an it is a little confusing that asks us to abstract members when we implement an inheritance but in this case it really means that we are overriding the empty concept with a concrete an example of an member of a class might be there would not be a common way of speaking for all nor is it because it requires language to some might argue that belongs on an way of thinking might declare that members represent behavior be and knowledge or beliefs be to is a behavior of a class a may learn to differently than an and neither knows how to just because they are both methods do not need to be is no such thing as a members can only appear on in the above having an method on the class implies that is an and a cannot be instantiated using the phrase baby new the class should inherit from and it should be instantiated as baby new because a is a and and both also inherit from could inherit from instead of being is because we are all something more than simply members cannot be only their implementations may be up the inheritance for must implement the method as an if inherits from it may then hide the implementation of with its own implementation by using the keyword hiding in reference classes can have a main distinction between an and an in that an class can define both a contract and a template of the whereas an only defines a class versus rahman hiding in chetan

chosen approach is as a response to this ve been looking around in this subject but i really find what looking code tables i stuff like specific legal or social more these types have only set properties and the items are not about to change soon properties being an a name and a wondering how to handle these best in the following the database one table with different the classes something like inheriting icode with and the for there should be a screen containing all of so a list of the types maritial status and then a list of values for that type with a name description for each item in the are things that appear in every single so there must be some best practice on how to handle the not really fond of using enums for these any arguments on using them here are welcome gotten a nice answer by codetoglory and refine this not talking about gender or maritial wich values will definately not but about that have a name and a but nothing for social legal want only one screen for listbox with possibe nameanddescription types just call them listbox with possible values for the selected nameanddescription and then a name and description field for the selected nameanddescription type could this be handled in view i find the difficulty here that the nameanddescription types would then need to be extracted from the class are for multiple vs single lookup practices with code or lookup

compiler in calculating an incorrect address for some of the class the culprit turned out to be a pack directive hidden in an obscure header file that was in some of the source i found and math came across a very simple class with few methods and most of which were defined in the header int makes my skin return the function returned when i was watch window showed the correct programmatic changes to were reflected in the watch on showed that it began 8 bytes into the raw memory window showed the correct programmatic changes to were reflected there as 4 bytes before were all which i interpreted to be the debugger through the code clearly showed a return value of i checked the disassembly window and found this are ptr address of the class ptr offset to other the compiler calculated the offset as when it should have been when i removed the definition of from the header and placed it into my source address was calculated that convinced me that it a packing and a search of the code base for quickly identified the an ancient header file that required alignment on boundaries but never reset the packing to the solution was as easy as enclosing the offending header like original code for your and if about to on my

covers your question pretty so give you an idiomatic rewrite of your findfactors i found it helpful for me when i was first you want to find all factors of a given number by looking at each number from up to checking to see if a factor of and building a list of those that version minimal modifications to get it to integer integer counter num let quotient div num then else num then findfactors findfactors couple of formatting changes to make it a bit more integer integer counter counter div num 2 otherwise if num counter then else findfactors is but less than ideal in a couple it recalculates quotient each time is which is divisions seems to realize this and calculate it only kinda annoying to have to deal with that counter variable still pretty way of looking at the problem would be to take the list of integers from up to and filter for just those that are factors of this translates pretty directly into integer num filter might come as a surprise to find that this has the same performance characteristics as the above haskell need to allocate memory for the entire list up to at it can just generate each value as	
create sortable element and attach an event on every portlet to open dialog but when i open more portlet to the main and click the setup link the header of the the setup for testing always fire for every portlet on the main why is this happen is the code i use to setup the sortable wich receive element from can see the elements on the left can see some screenshoot on this url you need the html markup i will post also later new in jquery var param param to the a portlet var title for prototyping handle var id var chartid true title url jsondata data function data tmp the function if return else return kyle for the my code and try the change you i think the main issue is how we can we tell the dialog box his parent element portlet his come on the code after i click the update the portlet affected is always the first portlet that i drop to the main area i hope my explanation is clear enough for you thanks here is the markup of a single portlet yang terlibat kegiatan penelitian dan pengabdian masyarakat id is added for testing only for i try traverse the and get the id of the object element from the object element generated automatically using u can see to code above the comment on the answer is limited to 300 so i post portlet and dialog box

creating the dictionary to handle the lookups of the various cases in the switch statement instead of making several branching ifs out of it to set the return trust me you want to change how doing it unless you want to make the map i had originally assumed that the dictionary stored a map from each case to the an index into another map for the return according to it actually stores an index to a label for the code that should be executed for that this makes absolute sense when you consider that the code that would be executed for each case may differ and may be much longer than in the given based on your i think i might be tempted to store the mappings in an external configuration read them in during start and construct the actual map either a single level map from key to value or a similar multilevel map from key to index and index to i think it would be easier to maintain these mappings in a configuration file than to update the code every time you needed to add or remove a particular

currently we split reviews into two reviews happen just per one or sometimes two other people but sometimes entirely unrelated coders to help spread expertise and get fresh comes over and sits with the the author then walks through the commenting on changes as reviews are a bit more like formal a coder who is not guided by the original author reviews the change usually typically an with a list of comments is the result experimenting with reviews are mandatory for all when we hit we typically start doubling up on the warm reviews two others will attend rather than just reviews are mostly for catching your own as an and for spreading understanding and catching the occasional they also help junior people come up to speed with our coding standards and best programmers are not allowed to be reviewed by other due to some issues with that in the reviews are usually reserved for larger checkins or groups of we use these for offsite for initial system commits of or and for or intrusive reviews are generally best for finding deeper structural issues or deep logic or error handling also try to get people to write up really fast design before launching into any given coding idea is write one to three of these a format is up to you you can use a bulleted task even sometimes get photos of a whiteboard that has been used in a meeting about a goal is to keep mdds short and in most more formal design docs can be set up as for larger in game we tend toward which necessarily obsoletes most large docs pretty reviews are usually quick on the doc by all interested parties and other

developed a tool on one of our projects many years ago which was basically a program started by the inetd daemon on a unix it basically acted as a conduit between a client and if we started it on 1465 could then connect clients to it at and it would open a conduit to actually did most of the grunt work of although we did also have a version which could act as its own default behavior was to pass everything through in both directions at full speed but it was configurable with commands passed to it via shared but other methods are down spurious quite a few served us well and helped out a great deal with network exception

do not agree with the current accepted foremost important aspect of multicore machines is that and main memory are far this means that unless the application is or easy to it is highly likely that it would be memory rather than cpu floating point multiplication takes about 4 clock while a memory fetch from main memory takes hundreds of clock exploiting cache locality becomes if the achieved performance on single core is sufficient of the applications would belong the this there is no need to but if it is not your application is much more responsive since they then you would do better to refactor your application to better exploit parallelism and cache the refactored application would consist of relatively independent less which run in parallel for for a good overview on multicore and the way things are the major points they say speed is not increasing anymore as it is more cost effective to manufacture more number of simpler than a small number of fast memory is far from a few there will be of in web 100s on so plan to scale your application to 100s or 1000s of this means you should create several independent are difficult to work therefore work with

exactly call it a among any in my simply that large companies consider it a big effort to upgrade everyone to ie7 in fact ie8 now that recently been a benefit versus cost decision that many executives seem to think has the simple answer that it just matter to the this may even be the truth in many cases if no system set up for automatically upgrading the vast number computers on the many people would argue having even a moderately decent browser ie7 or is would be a worthwhile thing for any the fact that ie8 has just been which now makes ie6 outdated by versions is certainly going to encourage companies to start the problem here is that as long as a significant market share for the vast majority of web designers are going to keep on designing sites to be compatible with regardless of poorness as a if really keen on getting everyone to upgrade from i ought to point you to the living in the perhaps if you campaign strongly enough within your you may just convince the people who make the decisions to though i like to bet on

example my sure you just to put the my my split my split if return if return if return if return return my my one way to do return another way to do it avoid so much return if yet another way to do it classic perl unreadable or return for 0 just a note that last one uses the logic to the statement to one so the can be added on the perl allow things like can only postfix one this is a always or in these because they have the lowest return 0 false is not a or a boolean though it hurt to just return 0 or or split might need to be to capture the you can probably leave it off if you assign an array to an of two it will silently discard all the extra split or die open while if print close of use a variable to store the in you should use to check if a hash element rather than it might exist but be set to happen in your but a nice habit for when your program gets more or die open while print if exists goes out of and implicitly you could also use wonderful which opens each element of for and acts as a filehandle that iterates through print if exists has been noted try to avoid unless you english to avoid the significant performance penalty of those evil in and as been noted but should always always and or else larry wall will descend from heaven and break your i see you have this is because even off of perl parses the shebang and will find your and will like it you to this will catch a lot of serious errors in your like not declaring variables with or using as a language your code work under as well as will result in much cleaner code that never breaks for reasons you figure spend hours at the debugger debugging and probably end up using and anyway just to figure out what the errors remove them if only your code is and releasing it and it generates any

examples you gave should have absolutely no performance difference in and i doubt they would differ in python confusing it with a different i i i i latter is faster in some architectures because the act of decrementing the variable will set the zero which can then be checked in a giving you the loop iteration and the conditional in one the former example needs to perform an explicit comparison or a subtraction to set a and then jump based on most of the time the compiler can optimise the first case into the second if it sees that the variable is effectively a and on some combinations instructions may be generated that make the first method more like the things like this are only worth trying if you have a tight inner loop that your profiler is telling you is but never notice the difference if there even is

fairly new to nhibernate and have run into a strange inheritance chaining issue with my repository been using as a and following his examples been creating interfaces to define contracts for dao operations in the data schema working with is rather and after a little while i found myself duplicating a lot of the and methods were exactly the same after i added a generic parameter to the base for this would be the most basic interface for repository interface where entitytype void void void entitytype just talk about the add method from now for the sake of with the generic the implementations were all the void using session using transaction typing this same method body repeatedly the slight change of only bad design in my so i created an abstract base class call repositorybase which provides the implementation for since using an abstract instead of an i the interface for classes inheriting from repositorybase and am forced to make any derivation abstract as even though it seems more to use an using this crappy little entity class public guid id public string name do interface ientity1repository naughty this is abstract class entity1repositorybase public abstract just bothers it but it rubs me the wrong especially as the chain of with this particular schema could go quite so i guess my questions i just being stupid and anal retentive about there a design that i should be looking at looked at some other examples and approach seems simplest for novice in is it ok to use an abstract base to provide functionality instead of an

far as i compilers typically align variables that are on the the library may be depending on some set of compiler options that supported on your the normal fix is to declare the variables that need to be aligned as but if you go about doing this in other want to be sure that they variables in question are initialized later on in the function rather than in the some compilers align this as on the needstobe32aligned change int find a compiler switch that aligns the variables on the obviously the align syntax used here may not be what your compiler

giving a straight answer to your like to also dispute the whenever a group of programmers characterizes the users of another language in this the odds are that they are telling you more about themselves than about the community they are for accuse c programmers of being too obsessed with low level or haskell programmers with being blinded by their desire for functional perl mongers for but you by getting the causality backwards when you do i want to write a program that is best expressed in a certain i try to choose a language that supports that sometimes you want a tool that lets you do unusual and for such a task having a language such as ruby is as valuable as having mathematica for math or javascript for browser manipulation in your if i want to play with typography i hop into postscript what best like saying you ever noticed that people who use power drills are always poking holes in but it kind of misses the

going to assume the calculations are being done in a java applet in the same browser where the flash is can call javascript from within the applet using the following this code could then update the values in the flash win from my assumption is then where is the java application on the client or on the server then you need flash i believe there are a few different flash remoting try searching for flash you can make it call the server every 2 seconds or so to get the latest running on the client i doubt you can connect to it from flash because of a signed java applet could connect anywhere it wants you could retrieve the data using then push it into flash using the method described would be a crazy hack can you do the same thing with never used flex

good practices and strategies are there for running regression tests in embedded environments or in other situations where the possibility to automate tests is very my experience a lot of the testing has to be performed manually a tester needs to push a sequence of buttons and verify that the machine behaves as a developer it is really hard to assure yourself that your changes break something proper regression tests the situation gets even worse during big refactorings and anyone recognize the did you find a good solution or process to deal with this kind of to perform regression tests in embedded	
good trick with excel and other apps is to manually create the you require using the excel whist recording a once this is done you can then inspect the generated vba to see how to use the api to acheive the same results you will of course have to do some translation from vba to but essentially the same methods should

guessing that the keyboard is being read directly instead of is a pretty strong assumption and before stitching a solution you should try to verify it there are different levels of doing actually two i can think of right for keyboard events from the main windows if this is the case then you can simulate a keyboard simply by sending the window the right kind of these can be wither or or perhaps some other related polling the for instance using this is somewhat unlikely and if this is really going i doubt you can do anything to simulate it take on this is trying to use the keyboard and see if it works with the if it figure out how to simulate what it tools which might be helpful with visual allows you to see what messages go into a allows you to see what syscalls a process is

had the same a vm would but it slows my 1 gb laptop down to a so i ended up having to upgrade to 2 gb memory and install i enjoy this a lot but since that is not an option here is what i came personally i like this if you have a windows xp disc lying around this option is especially if you have virtualization options on your though i like this one it is an i had windows 7 installed because it ran better than vista and xp but it gave me internet explorer i tried and it only let me preview internet explorer maybe it was too early a beta or because i had a beta either i dont like this one just by far a great great works perfectly in xp and internet explorer 6 and 7 work right with it in windows but if you have vista this is the way to multiple internet explorers work right under vista but this as stated this does not work in but it is an option for any windows xp user out there have been known issues with this causing your os to actually become more but i know for a fact if i just heard some reports about explorer 7 standalone though not applicable for this question others may find it useful to know that there is a standalone internet explorer on my vm i have internet explorer 6 installed by default and internet explorer 7 as i would not recommend this as standalone internet explorer 7 is not multipleies genuine internet explorer 7 or ietester is much better browser shots is a great tool but somewhat basically it takes a screenshot on literally hundreds of browsers and lets you view the thing is it is mighty and you get a full screen a great meer i heard about something from adobe labs called meer meer a while but i was never able to actually find i believe actually takes you to adobe website but it looks like a great tool complete with onion skin overlay and the like super preview but on the web instead of if it is definitely would check this one i say ietester is a great anyone running windows 7 however is left in the i tried every option out there and none of them worked for me except for linux host and virtualbox xp my

had this subject before but i find anything your needs might where no sanity check one might be required in the if you change your public fields to this breaks binary every client who uses your would have to is because it potentially costs a lot of properties from the beginning avoids this this even counts for code that is not part of a because you never the code if highly might prove useful so you want to refactor it to a this refactoring process is obviously made much easier if you are already using properties in place of writing public properties is easy in because you can just use the saving you quite a bit of datatype myproperty implement the necessary backing field and code for will add a personal behaviour in this regard is somewhat the compiler could just change public fields to properties on the thus avoiding the vb6 already did this for classes and i see absolutely no reason for and not to do the perhaps someone on the compiler teams could comment on

has always been the behavior as how else will the compiler build your project if it does not have a reference to all the assemblies that are referenced by your project are required for your application to you are using types from those assemblies and without those types your application cannot more importantly without those types your application cannot consider that every assembly that you reference was built in the same manner as your assembly and requires that all referenced assemblies be present and accounted this does create a chain reaction that can be annoying but the end result is that once you are executing your the clr has all the assemblies that it needs to run your

have at least these five options for modeling the type hierarchy you table one table for all product with enough columns to store all attributes of all this means of most of which are null on any given table one table for storing attributes common to all product then one table per product storing attributes specific to that product table no table for common products one table per product storing both common product and one table for storing attributes common to all product one extra column stores a blob of in or some other this blob allows you to store the attributes specific to each product you can use fancy design patterns to describe such as facade and but regardless you have a blob of attributes that be easily queried within you have to fetch the whole blob back to the application and sort it out one table for and one table that pivots attributes to instead of eav is not a valid design with respect to the relational but many people use it this is the mentioned by another see other questions with the on stackoverflow for some of the thoughts about although many people seem to favor i it seems like the most flexible and therefore the keep in mind the adage here are some of the disadvantages of way to make a column mandatory of way to use sql data types to validate way to ensure that attribute names are spelled way to put a foreign key on the values of any given for a lookup results in a conventional tabular layout is complex and because to get attributes from multiple rows you need to do for each degree of flexibility eav gives you requires sacrifices in other probably making your code as complex than it would have been to solve the original problem in a more conventional in most an unnecessary to have that degree of in the question about product much simpler to create a table per product type for so you have some consistent structure enforced at least for entries of the same product use eav only if must be permitted to potentially have a distinct set of when you have a finite set of product eav is class table inheritance would be my first

having trouble covering all the issues with doing software configuration management on a cms writing custom of but also custom modules and these websites and apps are for not want to actually version the configuration of the not just the code of its templates and because i want it to be ready to for or transfer to someone as quickly as right that means storing a full install for each site in including the installed versions of components and and storing actual database for i also keep the version of the code i usually bother for the since you can just drop it into the install and it problem with this that currently debating is in custom component in most other extensions are typically deployed using a web installer you least just drop the files in a certain since db changes are the installer system provides for db and file migration with install and uninstall so a pretty reasonable system for i work directly on the installed adding and changing files and then manually copying them to the packaged version of the work on the packaged component and use the installer to actually view the this option just takes too long but it does have the advantage of keeping the code especially in regard to db either the changes are duplicated to both versions of the files before and the duplication seems like a smell to does anyone else do are there better for

i had the need for a matrix type in a trivial answer to this need would be to use but the additional issue i have is that i would like a matrix to store arbitrary values with mixed similarly to a does not perform an example you can the must be homogeneous in if a string value is present in my every value gets implicitly stored as a this is also confirmed by accessing the single the python list type can instead accept mixed you can have a list containing an integer and a both conserving their what i would need is something similar to a but operating in a i had to implement my own i had two choices for the internal list containing and both solutions have of lists require careful synchronization of the various swapping two rows is swapping two columns is less removing a row is easy as a tuple as a are slightly but you have to define the limits of your key you cannot insert element if your matrix is and they are more complex to use to or swap columns or the concrete reason on why i need this functionality is because i am reading csv once i collect the values from a csv file that can be i would like to perform insertion and other operations for this reason i need a curiosities you know if a python data type providing this service already exists in a library out is this data type not provided in the standard too restricted interest would you have solved this or another smarter in

i have exactly one per test but i think more often i have several seen the case that eludes where a very large piece of code has a single unit test suite with just a few test and they are all labeled and each test case has hundreds of and even each condition usually depends upon the of previous whenever the build invariably in such a unit it takes quite some time to determine where the problem the other extreme is what your question a separate test case for each possible depending on what this might make but often i have several per test if you wrote you might have some cases that look void void void void try int number numberformatexception for string numstr but instead got the number expected simple rules that i can think of off hand for how many to put in a test have more than one that depends on the of previous together that test the same or facet need for the overhead of multiple unit test cases when not of the above rules should be overridden by practicality and common you probably want a thousand unit test cases with a single assert in each even several and you want a single test case with hundreds of

i have found strange since i started working on gwt is how few open source projects there are in this i was surprised to discover this mainly because gwt itself is open but after puzzling over my suspicion is that it is mainly used for internal projects by large corporations who already use java and are using gwt for their rias instead of flex or my understanding is that large corporations that use java would tend to have lower contributions to open source because their focus is mainly on internal or commercial this sound like an accurate interpretation or does anyone have a different explanation for this are there so few open source gwt

i have the library you wish for it may be out there somewhere and would be but this may one of the interesting concepts the school of unit testing thought has come up with is the idea of an in some there seems to be as much value in taking the calls an object makes to the entire universe of things outside of and turning them into an as there is in the typical act of making an interface for methods the outside world can call your this you might instead of mocking the entire file making one or more logically coherent interfaces for the answers and services your object needs from the outside the calls would merely answer the questions you need answered not dictate you can use dependency injection as you mentioned to inject in the implementation you desire for your and probably use moq to do so since familiar with your might have a method called it might accept a if there is a business question your object is trying to and seeing if a file exists is merely the that question is then your outgoing interface might not have a method about file existence at it might instead be something like or even is some but might be truer to the principles of good unit testing let your express what it is trying to and let your unit tests test it and only just a thought hope it

i know this is a common question but there just seem to be any good answers for have a bucket with gobs have no clue how number of files in they are all within 2k a how do i figure out how many of these files i have used the and jets3t stuff and the best i can find is a command to count the first 1000 records performing gets on been using applet as well cause really nice to work with but even that i list all my objects cause i run out of heap cause it is peforming gets on all of them and keeping them in how can i just delete a the best thing seen is a paralleized delete loop and that has problems cause sometimes it tries to delete the same this is what all the commands that ran across do you guys do who have boasted about hosting millions of what happens when you want to remove are there alternate answers to all of these files are files so not even sure s3 is such a concern maybe i should move this to a document database of it boils down to is that the amazon s3 api is just straight out missing 2 very important operations count and there is a delete bucket command but it only works when the bucket is if someone comes up with a method that does not suck to do these two operations gladly give up lots of to answer a few the reason i ask this was i have been for the past year or so been storing hundreds of more like millions of 2k txt and xml the last a couple of months i wished to delete the bucket it literally took days to do so because the bucket has to be empty before you can delete this was such a pain in the ass i am fearing ever having to do this again without api support for rocks the a good couple gigs worth of files within you steve do i objects in a s3

i solved my perl port of comment about how simple the the i went out to port parts of to a quick regular expressions would have been a faster way to access but i felt that the hack value and an opportunity to learn python would be be worth i still feel much using debugging code perl than of the porting effort very and different notions and objects has been the only issue so far where a bit simple translation of idioms was the result is a which after a bit of polishing will on module called existed on but its parsing capabilities it spews debugging output the place and seem to support transforming detecting actual errors in the upon i tried to parse the a few iteration of fixing trivial bugs in my parsing i error message that was strikingly similar to not error use string as a while in use at line line now at a point where quite likely that the actual is we get an idea it is turned out that the first line of the following sequence was 7724 in the pointed to that from similar records earlier in it was clear that a object was all later records shared this wrong with a it was trivial to fix find it ironic that i found the source of the error by feature that tells the user its position in the stream when it will move away from as soon as i find time transform its pickled mess needs more meaningful error messages that tell the the position of the data stream the poision in its where things go parts to perl was fun in the

i write a message driven much like a standard windows app only that it extensively uses messaging for internal what would be the best approach regarding to i see there are basically three approaches you have any other setup in please a single thread process all of the separate threads for separate message types multiple threads that share and process a single message would there be any significant performance differences between the are some general the last two options benefit from a situation where more than one if any thread is waiting for an external other threads can still process unrelated but ignoring seems that multiple threads only add overhead not to mention more complicated sync another would you recommend to implement such a system upon the standard windows messaging or to implement a separate queue and better

impossible to not knowing the size of and the call to it will preallocate the buffer just once given the length of the format string and the strings that will be inserted and then concatenate everything and insert it into the for very large this will be advantageous over separate calls to which might cause the buffer to expand multiple the three calls to might or might not trigger growth of the buffer and that check is performed each if the strings are small enough and no buffer expansion is then it will be faster than the call to because it have to parse the format string to figure out where to do the data is needed for a definitive should be noted that there is little discussion of using the static method on the using reminded me of his test results show that to be the best case you have to take advantage of specific format does the same thing in that it will predetermine the length of the strings to concatenate and preallocate the buffer slightly more overhead due to looping constructs through the performance is going to be comparable to just the plain addition since it compiles to a call to with the caveat that all of the additions are in the same one call to result a b two calls to result a result all those putting up test need to run your test cases in runs at the perform a gc between the measuring of separate test the reason for this is that if you do creating a new in each iteration of the loop for one and then you run the next test that loops the same number of creating an the gc will more than likely step in during the second test and hinder its

in any practical understand why helpful to compare drm with encryption is a mechanism to share secrets with trusted second parties without the possibility of a untrusted party receiving the secret encryption is built upon a very solid background of and works because the second party is considered to be trustworthy of the key to unlock the secret on the other assigns no trust to any party except the original the assumption is that the second party has a revocable right to the secret and is not to pass the message to any other even if they want the problem with that is the second party must somehow still decrypt the even though they are not trusted with the ability to do this is the basic conceptual challenge of accomplishes this using two first is the algorithms and keys used to encrypt or decrypt the managed message are themselves kept patent encumbrance is used on some usually the decoding so that the parties that do know that part are prevented legally from disclosing it to other or using it at all without proper of these features are in opposition to open by its very open source discloses any bit of code released under supposedly open source that happens to also be patent encumbered fails to in fact be free

in situations like this create a delegate that matches the signature of the method i want to call in the parent class think that would be updatehud in your and then pass an instance of that delegate a reference to to the child form search form in this when the child form is finished accepting it invokes the delegate using the data collected on the say updatehud is a method in the parent form that looks something like void string would create a delegate with the same like delegate void string you would add a hudupdatehandler parameter to the constructor of the child form and store it in a private field when your child form is ready to send its data you would invoke the child private field for that will invoke updatehud in your parent class using the values from the child and you have to expose find this approach simpler to implement than raising and catching and it allows you to keep the internals of your parent class

is a c it takes a c source file and creates machine either in the form of unlinked object files or as an actual executable which has been linked to all object modules and is useful for controlling the build process of a a typical c program consists of several modules and header files it would be to always compile everything after you change so make is designed to only compile the parts that need to be after a does this by following rules created by the for cc rule tells make that the file depends on the files and and if either of them it can be built by running the command on the second above is not actual make wants the commands indented by a tab which i do in this editing imagine reads its rules from a file that is usually called a since these files are written by make has a lot of magic to let you shorten the for it knows that a can be built from a and it knows what the command to do so the above rule could be shortened to small program consisting of three modules might have a makefile like mycmd can do more than just compile a typical makefile will have a rule to clean out unwanted rm core rule might run diff makefile might run a tool to convert documentation from some markup language to html and for makefile might have an install rule to copy the binary program it builds to wherever the user or system administrator wants it so since make is generic and it is typically used to automate the whole process from unpacking a source tarball to the point where the software is ready to be used by the is a whole lot of to learn about make if you want to learn it the gnu version of make has particularly good has it in various	
is a difficult i have changed my habit related to this question several times in the last so here are some thoughts coming to my mind the arguments in the constructor is like checking the arguments for a traditional so i would not differentiate the arguments of a method of course does help to ensure parameters passed are but also introduces a lot of more code you have to which not always pays off in my especially when you do write short methods which delegate quite frequently to other i guess you would end up with 50 of your code just doing parameter consider that very often when you write a unit test for your you want to have to pass in valid parameters for all quite often it does make sense to only pass those parameters important for the current test so having checks would slow you down in writing unit think this really depends on the what i ended up is to only write parameter checks when i know that the parameters do come from an external system user web or something like if data comes from my own i write tests most of the

is a really challenging problem to generate synthetic sounds that sound there are many techniques some some really to get good results you will have to use one of the more complex synthesis synthesis modulation distortion synthesis modeling are some synthesis methods taken from physical modeling can produce really good sounds but this shows in the complexity of the method the idea is the implementation should probably start with additive for this just add sine waves of the fundamental frequency and integer for example 440 1320 the amplitude should drop exponentially with the information about the structure of the components is best found in scientific papers about music instrument finally you must modulate the amplitude of the signal with an timevarying the structure for a guitar can be found in mentioned links from a guitar string and sound a really simple approximation of full physical modeling with differential maybe quite limited to guitar strings and similar but exactly what you are looking for and surely simpler to do than tuning a additive i will try it myself if i find some time over the really exited what one can get out of the

it for readability i find that all the subscripting hurts my so probably write it more i int val or whatever type int result default result if result else if 2 result guessing the compiler will generate similar code with optimizations cranked but i be shocked if one or the other was slightly very and bet that if one it would be the one using the you might get a very slight improvement by changing walking through the array using an index to walking through it using a very compiler and situation p int val or whatever type int result default result if result else if 2 result aware that these are and generally should not even be worried about for readability and correctness just pointing out some options for when the might be warranted suggestions have to backed up with analysis of the particular far as whether the compiler will repeatedly reload from something like or that depends on the flow of control and whether the object being accessed is a global or has had its address taken and passed to something the object is global or has had its address taken and you call a generally the compiler has to assume that the object could have been modified by the function and will have to reload similar issues happen when pointers are used to pass information to using locals can help mitigate this since a compiler can very easily determine that a local is not modified by a called function unless the address of the local is compilers can also try solve this problem by using some sort of global optimization as what msvc does at link example code probably really hitting this problem even if array is global because you the value from the array after called the either of those functions only write to wonder why markdown is removing blank lines from the

layout is extremely at least a table starts with and ends with inside you have zero or more rows inside of which you have zero or more columns there are a few other tags for header but really all you need to know about tables no tutorial main advantages to a table size of a table adjusts based on the size of the always line making it easy to line content up to code a few lines of html are all needed for basic supported the table will look and act properly in browsers looking at downsides to tables include an relationship status with and not to mention the scorn of your tables a complete replacement for and but let anyone tell you that and css are complete replacements for tables attempting to style a there are a few things that you can play with to make it look the way you this defines a border around and between the cells of the this is the amount of padding between the content and the edges of the horizontal alignment of content within the vertical alignment of content within the cell for vertical you can collapse the border to remove any spacing between

map rendering speed is typically dominated by two data access and label doing coordinate projection and typical 2d rendering happens about as fast as data can be read from an external shapefile or the trick is how much data are you loading to draw a and how long does it take to get complicated db queries may be causing inefficient querying data which is not indexed will cause slow even if you find data you need to be aware of how much you are does your data contain a very detailed single polygon for all of islands at high but you are only rendering the border in

method also allows derived classes to handle the event without attaching a this is the preferred technique for handling the event in a derived if i understand the above then if we derive a class from we should instead of subscribing to selectedindexchanged treat method as an event handler and thus put any event processing logic inside override void handling would that be better than subscribing to an via onselectedindexchanged in ascx file we use onselectedindexchanged attribute to attach event handler to an name of this attribute is the same as the name of why is why instead the name of this attribute selectedindexchanged attribute refers to an event and not to a method that calls this be sure that you call or the event you want anyone else to be able to respond to this then would it be perfectly ok not to call since i would think not calling it really do any harm besides not firing an event and thus event handlers be called realize some events need to be fired in order for framework to do its but what about not calling should derived classes handle an event without attaching a

notice that in your first the simple record is sorted before record this order is also how you see the results in the regardless of whether you sort by would seem to make sense to me if the dates exactly the and the date for is before the date for instead of finding that the are exactly equal then proceeding to sort by the query finds that the dates are not equal and simply sorts by that like all the other see from browsing around that sqlite have a native understanding of date or datetime data types and instead gives users the choice of floating point numbers or text that they must parse is it possible that the literal representation of the dates in the database are not exactly most people seem to need to date so that dates behave like you would perhaps a way to wrap your order by column with a that will give you something concrete to like attending not sure that syntax but an area to look at for solving your hope that

of an interface as a contract to define or a a general approach and not really language in context of if you are working in a single inheritance there is an excellent case to be made for preferring interfaces over classes for defining your object since that single super class pathway is fairly precious and you want to save it for something more than defining properties that are exposed on an or have icontainer semantics is a fairly poor reason to make an interface out of your better to have your folder it is doing any the already icontainer or icollection interface in your core the better choice is fairly dependent on the specific in case of your recipes that are also folders you are probably thinking of a or relationship a semantic that can be expressed using interfaces if you will have other elements in your system on things that are composed using that sort of is a bit of overhead with if you find yourself when you are done with nothing more than a set of woof and iwoof classes and then know you probably need to express your problem in terms of interfaces simple classes would have been a for any you should have at least a couple of concrete classes more meaningful names other than or that

of my favorite features about python is that you can write configuration files in python that are very simple to read and if you put a few boundaries on you can be pretty confident that will know exactly what you mean and will be perfectly capable of reconfiguring your question what exactly are those my own personal heuristic flow no or those be in a text config file and people expecting to have understand in it probably matter the order in which your statements to literal methods and functions called on objects are harder to think anything implicit is going to be a if something complicated that has to happen with your change how keywords and error handling are right guess i ask this because i came across a situation with my django config file where it seems to be useful to break these i happen to like but i feel a little my project is deployed through svn checkouts to a couple different servers that all be configured the same will share a some for i throw a hook at the from import localized localized is on the python path but outside the working what do you either about this or about python config boundaries in it ever polite to put code in a python configuration	
of the classical reason we have a database deadlock is when two transactions are inserting tables in a different transaction a inserts in table a then table transaction b inserts in table b followed by a scenario is always at risk of a database deadlock you are not using serializable isolation question what kind of patterns do you follow in your design to make sure that all transactions are in the same book i was had a suggestion that you can sort the statements by the name of the you done something like this or different which would enforce that all are in the same order what about deleting records needs to start from child tables and need to start from parent do you ensure that this would not run into a deadlock

off topic ben has the answer you are looking for but the logic in some of your code is a little if astring name really need to check safe and common practice to reassign nil over nil and to send a release message any to the runtime short circuits the latter and the optimiser will remove the if setting a nil name is an you should assert that astring is not nsstrings are very well bother optimising out the case where you are setting the name of a car to the name that is already your check which you take every time someone set a string is slower than the release and copy you are avoiding in the minority of you check what happens when you send copy to an find it just increases the retain note that this is not true for nsmutablestring for obvious reasons good rule of thumb optimise when you have all functionality and only optimise what is slow following on from comments about rename astring to acarname or something else more descriptive your future self will thank

precision for a value is around 7 digits after the decimal which means the value you are adding is essentially at least when added to the value can effortlessly stored in a float since the exponent is small in that but to successfully add it to you have to use the exponent of the larger number and then the digits after the zeroes disappear in can use if you need more this make a difference on hardware and memory is often also not as constrained that you have to think about every single as you stated that using is not an option you could use as pointed out in a option may be to perform intermediary calculations in and afterwards cast to this will only when there are a few more operations than just adding a very small number to a larger

problem is that it gives the wrong impression it makes it look like the value when actually only the value that rather than the i think the code analysis is being overly cautious here there are plenty of places where you might want a mutable type stored in a readonly particularly if initialized in a static initializer and then never mutated within your the field is more of a risk of derived classes abusing personally i like all my fields to be on the other i know your code it could be that weighed that up against the possibilities and decided the right thing to really is less to worry other than the general impression of immutability given by the fact that the field is disable the warning for that and add a comment to emphasize that the object is mutable even though the field is	
problem is that the joins between and and need to happen in all that you programs and match against in boolean and or match against in boolean and because in your first query you can ignore those parenthesis everything is together and the tables join up in your second not what the database is really taking the rows in and crossing that with the rows in therefore normally you use joins i to limit that to a linear list of valid in your query you allow row to match instead of matching so for each row in one table that matches also selecting the rows in the other

processor has instructions that when a certain condition is met it and otherwise it continues on to the next a into register the zero flag is set register 0 contains then jump to complex conditions b become a sequence of instructions that leaves a register in a 0 or non zero so the branchif instruction can jump or not jump based on the conditional are many conditional flags and some branchif instructions also operate on more complex conditions it might actually check to see if a register is equal to another rather than simply looking at each architecture is different and makes tradeoffs so the instruction set is but also speedy and moocha points out in the some architectures allow you to apply a conditional to or even all so you might not only have but also x86 is very complex beyond this simple explanation once you get into out of order and all the other advanced for most purposes the above explanation is if writing a hand crafted very tightly wound have to take these things into account for maximum performance and a topic for another question

proja depends on projb and projb depends on proja then i am surprised you can build it at this sort of circular build dependency normally kills clean you often get away with it on dev machines where an old proja is still lying around when you build projb and but on a clean machine then this kind of dependency often breaks what the dependencies it might be simplest to move the common dependencies to a new assembly that has no dependencioes of its but which both proja and projb depend this means you can then build then proja and projb in any order this kind of refactoring is often simplest when you are only depending on interfaces from projc rather than concrete sure this entirely answers your but it might give you an alternative way to fixing

question is actually not language agnostic at in some languages you could easily decorate the but stick to even there i say apparent thing we would like to do is some sort of of the for annotate your handlers with a then scan for all classes annotated with the messy way that basically requires the class files to be loaded or using something like you are running in a context such as an even more interesting option you can get all beans implementing a certain such as the interface void then find them in your dispatcher handlers handler method handlemethod type the code above is realize i go out of the boundaries my point is that the elegance of the solution depends on your language of what external tools you are willing to use and what framework you are	
question is does not work at a it works a a volume and you will have a device path which you can using the filesystem api will automatically mount the device volume with a on a file by file or you can access the device directly by should be easy to backup all files on the snapped device volume forget all of the file streams and for ntfs your problem will be restoring vss will not help you on the the main problem will be restoring a system where you will need another os to boot to like winpe or dos or something if your not worried about system volumes then restore can be you backup the data in terms of then you get the added benefit that if you write a volume device driver for it look like a volume or then windows will a filesystem driver for this gives you a free explorer this is what most sector based backup applications also it gives them vm if you are doing simple file it helps to understand filesystems so that you know what you backup and do you know what a ntfs reparse point how are you going to deal with it if you hit one during your do you know how windows actually boots and what files you need to backup and restore and to be able to have a chance at on a how best do you lay out the ntfs volume as not to affect ntfs performance on the restored are you going to support restoring system volumes to new what does that require you to do just to have a chance of the questions are is not there are lots of edge cases some of the questions that you know about until you hit luck on you i hope i put you off too just saying there is a lot of work to be able to deliver a backup application that most people have have no idea	
question is long winded because i have been updating the question over a very long time trying to get ssis to properly export excel managed to solve this although not aside from someone providing a correct the solution listed in this question is not only answer i found was to create a row named wide enough for my in the named range sample data and hide appends the data and reads metadata from the single is close enough for it to drop stuff in data takes the format of the hidden single this allows what a pain in the it will take over 450 days of exports to recover the time i still love ssis and will continue to use it because it is still way better than filemaker my next attempt will be doing the same thing in the report question you are in sql server integrations services designer and want to export data to an excel file starting on something other than the first lets say the forth how do you specify tried going in to the excel destination of the data changed the accessmode to openrowset from then set the variable to this fails saying it cannot find the the sheet is called thought you could specify in excel you can select a set of cells and name them with the name this allows you to select the name instead of the sheet without the dollar oddly whatever the range you it appends the data to the next row after the as you add it increases the named row odd thing is the data takes the format of the last line of the range my header rows are if i specify a range that ends with the header the data appends to the row and makes all the entries if you specify one row it puts a blank line between the header row and the but the data is not matter what i ssis samples the of the file and sets the metadata according to what it if you have sample data that has a value of zero but is formatted as the first it treats that column as text and inserts numeric values with a single quote in front i also tried headers that do not reflect the data types of the i tried changing the metadata of the excel but it always changes it back when i run the then fails saying it will truncate if i tell it to ignore it imports everything except that days of several hours a piece tried every a mostly working example is to create the named range starting with the column format your column headers as you want the data to look as the data takes on this in my these exist from a4 to which is my defined ssis appends to the row after the defined so defining a4 to e68 appends the rows starting at you define the connection as having the first row contains the field it takes on the metadata of the header not the second and it guesses at the data not the formatted data type of the headers are so all my metadata is if your headers are so is all of your even tried making a sample data row without i think anyone actually uses excel with the default ms ssis you could define the to with no header row and format those columns not without it skipping a row in this would be very from what i noone uses ssis to export excel without a third party connection ideas on how to set this up properly so that data is formatted the metadata read from excel is proper to the real and formatting inherits from the first row of not the headers in last update got this to work very one thing i added to excel was the in the excel connection this forces excel to look at all rows to see what kind of data is in this does not drop say for instance if you have a zip code then about 9 rows down you have a excel without this blanks that field entirely without with it recognizes that zip is actually a character field instead of of one more update will succeed importing data with missing contents in the first 8 but it will fail exporting data where no data have it on your import connection but not your export excel connection have to after so much it works pretty if you are using a x64 bit make sure you call the dtexec from sql it will load the 32 bit excel driver and work to export ssis to microsoft excel without additional

reading descriptions of how gc and the part about how objects end up in generation and the collection of loh objects happens at full collection only as does collection of generation the idea that springs to mind why not just keep generation 2 and large objects in the same as going to get collected what actually happens then it would explain how small objects end up in the same place as the loh if long lived enough to end up in generation so your problem would appear to be a pretty good rebuttal to the idea that occurs to me it would result in the fragmentation of the your problem be explained by the loh and generation 2 sharing the same heap although that is by no means proof that this is the the output of pretty much blows this theory out of the the generation 2 and loh have their own

realize that this answer your but i really understand why there need to be studies on this sort of the implications of either setup are pretty especially if ever worked in each type of a bullpen or cubicle communication between team members is going to be maximized but going to be difficult for anyone to be maintain their focus and maximizing communication in this manner is a double edged good because everyone will know going on and contribute to technical conversations they eavesdrop but bad because everyone is going to get sucked into conversations closed door people have to work harder at keeping communication channels open but much easier to maintain focus and concentration on worked in both types of i much prefer closed door a closed door office gives me the choice of whether to be involved in communication or be able to sit and setups do not give me that even with headphones i sometimes find it very difficult to concentrate when a conversation going on think the ideal setup would be to have a common area where people can do work in a shared environment if not doing anything that requires a great deal of concentration along with closed door offices for when people need to make phone calls or concentrate without i think the reality is that no company is going to pay for that extra

really be storing the age within the database as it is easily calculated and changes on a daily would suggest that you keep the date of birth field and just calculate the age as you need if you wish to have the age selected along with the other attributes then consider a perhaps with a user defined function to calculate the following is an example udf that you could function age declare select from where userid return within your queries you can do something similar to the as answer to your question on sorting then you could create a view on the data and use that to show the data so something like this view as can then use this view to perform your there could be a performance hit for filtering and sorting based on the age and if you regularly based upon the age field then you may want to create an indexed

really is a loaded the biggest issue you are probably facing is that has a terrible separation of concerns regarding backend and another thing that i would not be suprised to hear is that your html developers cringe when they see server control generated really does have some interesting this suggestion then may offer you no but this is what our company has and we were in the same boat as switched to an mvc your best choices in are of course the new mvc and mvc web frameworks allow a loose coupling between server logic and which allows you to create less standards because have much less crosstalk in your html developers will simply receive the data the page requires and then will be able to frame their markup around making it entirely possible that they not need to write any server and your server side developers will not need to create the biggest reason for diving into others code is to do something you need to do but as if you simplify your connection to be simple classes passed to the markup this crosstalk should be we as a company realized a much higher productivity level by switching to	
really is this your personal repo or is it a repo that is shared by many how far into the project are i commit to my subversion repositories when i am done with one aspect and everything it does not have to be just not i prefer to not leave things broken in the first written code can get checked but only in my personal generally with notes about what i was doing at the time and what still needs to get since i use subversion and this is my personal repo i use this mainly to be able to leave my desktop and pick back up where i left off on my the one per commit is but may not suit your development if this is a more complete project it may work out since commits mean that you are crossing items off a list somewhere and it means one more item that is now things to what is significant about the changes that it warrants checking for i checked in code last night that significantly changed an internal this meant i had to document the changes in the commit message as well as the at the same time i also changed a few comments to fix that gets a small on the commit but is not something i consider a big enough issue to get committed on its

really the answer to your but in many real world applications are written in a higher language using the idioms common to that and only use a bit of assembly language where performance or hardware needs this is probably the only sensible approach for real because assembly language just as productive as other in terms of getting the computer to do more for each hour spent programming being all of the tools and techniques for managing a project in any other language apply equally to assembly source project meaningful names for separation of object oriented design patterns can have object oriented design without an object oriented all apply equally to assembly language as it does to or

say i have this extention static bool throw new return you think this null check and exception throwing is really i when i use the an will be thrown can maybe think of one reason why i but would just like to hear others view on and my reason for asking is partly laziness to write as little as but also because i kind of think a bunch of null checking and exception throwing kind of clutters up the methods which often end up being twice as long as they really needed to someone should know better than to send null into a method what do you guys is an extension method and throw an not a see method try it yourself if you believe me after the answers given here i have been persuaded to start checking more for null i am still lazy so i have started to use the class in shared can recommend taking a look at instead of my example i can do this static bool return should i bother checking for null in this

should know when each customer arrived in the when they arrive at the server you should add one to the number of customers served as well as accumulate the amount of time he at the end of the simulation you simply divide the accumulated time by the number of customers and you have a mean wait time for the core problem is in accounting for different events and updating statistics based on those simulation should initialize all of the structures of your simulation into a reasonable the queue of customers to no one in any count of served customers to any accumulated wait times to the current system time to all the system has been initailized you create an event that a cusotmer this will normally be determined by some given generating system events will need to update the statistics of the you have a choice at this point of generating all of the arrival the service time of each customer is also something that you will generate from a given must then handle each event and update the statistics for example when the first customer arrives the queue has been empty from the time the simulation started to the current the average number of customers in the queue is likely a parameter of you should accumulate the 0 elapsed seconds into an once the customer arrives at the empty queue you should generate the service either the next customer will arrive before or after the given job if the next cusomter arrives before the previous one has been serviced then you add him into the queue the fact no one has been depending on what event occurs next you must accumulate the statistics that occur in that time the idle time of the server is also a parameter of interest in such make things more clear consider the fact there are 18 people in line and the server has completed a job for the first the interval of between the arrival of the 18th customer and the time the first persons job is complete is a weighted average to be added to an there have been 18 people in line for 4 seconds for server has not been idle so you should take an entry off the queue and start processing the next the job will take some amount of time usually defined from some if the next customer arrives before the current job is finished the fact 17 people were in line would be added to your weighted at the fundamental level you are accumulating statistics between relevant events in your wait that helps it seems a bit

sounds like working within a framework that was designed by someone else where you have services and a and now that you have all this stuff looking at the big pile of code and asking there an easier the short answer is there is always an easier there are as many different ways of doing data access as there are the model using is fairly complex and sounds like it follows the principles of domain driven ddd is a great methodology and it provides excellent separation of concerns and high but it also requires a lot of plumbing code and not well understood by most programmers so getting help can be i do think the best way to build enterprise but not the best model for you to follow if new to doing a small project you might want to consider bypassing the bll no services no just have a common that contains your entity classes and build a dll that contains data access methods that directly populate and save your even simpler approach is to do away with the entity classes and just have your dll return datatables that contain your entity this approach looses the strong typing of an entity class but it is much easier to approach is to use entity ef will do all of this for you and it will generate strongly typed entity it does take a little while to get used to ef but once you understand how to work with it can drastically reduce the time it takes you to write persistence for some good tutorials on check out blog	
sounds like you want to have the delegate methods received by multiple on mac os the solution is to use the notification i looked at the but it looks like it only supports a delegate out of the are great because they let an object broadcast information to any other objects that are interested in receiving objects register themselves with the notification center to be notified when particular notifications are you could very easily add this capability by implementing your own class to wrap what write your own class that has an as an instance you would set this class as the delegate for the when the delegate methods get you would post notifications to the probably need to stuff the parameters from the delegate methods into the the flip your view controllers would sign up with the as observers for the notifications your custom class every time the delegate methods each view controller will receive a notification of that some nsstring mysocketwrapper nsobject give this class a better name asyncsocket the asyncsocketdidreaddata if return socket initialize this however you return nsdictionary in your various view you can write code like if return do any initalization you need note that if you specify for be sent notifications for every mysocketwrapper return asyncsocket nsdata long tag do what you want with the data this code entirely and i may have gotten some method names wrong doing this from but this is a solution that should work for

standard answers all questions in section a at most one of the data members can be active at any that the value of at most one of the data members can be stored in a union at any one special guarantee is made in order to simplify the use of if a contains several that share a common initial sequence and if an object of this type contains one of the it is permitted to inspect the common initial sequence of any of see the size of a union is sufficient to contain the largest of its data each data member is allocated as if it were the sole member of a means each member share the same memory there at most one member but you find out which you will have to store that information about the currently active member yourself somewhere storing such a flag in addition to the union example having a struct with an integer as the and an union as the will give you a so called an union which knows what type in it is currently the common use is in where you can have different but depending on the you have different informations to store into each struct to show what a common initial sequence tokeni int type tag union struct int struct int int struct int struct string standard allows you to access of each because the common initial sequence of each exist compiler extensions that allow accessing all members disregarding which one currently has its value that allows efficient reinterpretation of stored bits with different types among each of the for the following may be used to dissect a float variable into 2 unsigned unsigned short float can come quite handy when writing if the compiler does not support that but you do it you write code whose results are not so be certain your compiler has support for it if you use that

straight answer is that the behaviour of the wildcard characters is dependent on the ansi query mode of the interface being query mode uses the query mode server compatibility uses the these modes are specific to and bear only a passing resemblance to the and ado interface always uses query dao interface always uses query using odbc the query mode can be explicitly specified via the ms access user from the 2003 version can use either query so assume it is one or the other at any given time do not use wildcard characters in validation sql syntax has an which allows the query mode characters and regardless of the query mode of the however has the slight disadvantage of the keyword not being compatible remains highly the main is that i understand the keyword is not officially supported i imagine it will disappear or have altered behaviour anytime

table is the central type in and can be treated as either an associative array table or or as an ordinary the keys can be values of any lua type except and the elements of a table can hold any value except member access is made more efficient than hash key access behind the but the details usually that actually makes handling sparse arrays handy since storage only need be allocated for those cells that contain a value at does lead to a universal array idiom that feels a little strange to a c 3 an array stored in the variable with three elements that have the same values as their because the elements are stored at sequential indices beginning with the length of by or is a table with keys can be done like return 17 will have entries named and an anonymous of looking up that last element without iterating the table might be tricky unless a copy of that very function is stored in some other place that curly braces appear is really the same semantic but it is concealed a new user of behind some syntactic it is common to write functions that take a single argument that should be a in that calling the function does not require use of this results in code that seems to contain a mix of and both apparently used as a function call equivalent to is also less hard on the calling a function with a literal value also works for string

the new which is run by the problem with ec2 is that the bare minimum you have to pay to keep a server up 30 days a month is about mosso has options as low as a less but good for development and thing that i question about these guys though is their computing they say they evenly divide up an 4 core processor based on what type of server you if we assume they give you an 4 core to yourself when you get their most expensive server might not even be they get a crazy you could go get a dedicated server at any other good with the double the cores and the same amount of ram for half the downside is they do not yet appear to have an have stated they are currently working on

the small scale doing a join on and and query caching is probably fine but does slow down pretty quickly as friends and events you could also try an event based model in which every time a user creates an event an entry is created in a join table called thus whenever a user wants to see what events their friends have created they can simply do a join between their own id and the table and find in this way you avoid grabbing all a users with friends and then joining their friends with the events

the solution looking foos bars for x in recommend using a list comprehension for x in over using map as it avoids the overhead of a function call on every iteration can be very if just going to use it in a for get better speeds by using a generator y for x in for z in print difference is that the generator comprehension is in response to this course you that you copy all entries are the same bars so if you modify any one of them original you modify all of suppose this is a valid there are two solutions to this that i can think the most efficient is probably something like for x in tuples are this will prevent bars from being modified through the results of this list comprehension generator comprehension if you go that if you really need to modify each and every one of the you can do copy import for x in this can be a bit expensive both in terms of memory usage and in so recommend against it unless you really need to add to each one of

the the difference between a project and an an app is a web application that does something a weblog a database of public records or a simple poll a project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular web a project can contain multiple an app can be in multiple versus is really more of a separate but understanding the distinction django draws between a and an is a big part of good code roughly this is what the two terms application tries to provide a relatively set of related an application is allowed to define a set of models it have and to define and register custom template tags and filters it have project is a collection of installed into the same and all using the same settings in a the defining aspect of a project is that it supplies a settings file which specifies the database to the applications to and other bits of a project may correspond to a single web but have to multiple projects can run on the same the project is also responsible for the root url though in most cases useful to just have that consist of calls to include which pull in url configurations from inidividual custom custom context processors and most other things django lets you create can all be defined either at the level of the project or of the and where you do that should depend on most effective for in best placed inside an application increases their portability across

there are not feature lists available for all osgi to be a certified osgi container one has to meet not all of the features described in osgi core specification none of the equinox as the reference implementation and with a vibrant community usually fulfills the upcoming spec as the first others are catching while having different ultimately you have to run tests on your very own requirements to decide wether one implementation is the right fit or but there is no silver bullet instance equinox is great with features but drags quiet some overweight into the system with features you might not in the enterprise this is usually no problem when running on a but when being on a embedded this things might terms of tooling which is crucial for your development eclipse offers the best integration it focuses on equinox which for itself makes it appear to be best to be used with paxrunner enables you to run any implementation within eclipse as with the benefit of not emulating the osgi environment with the development switch built into equinox which unfortunately in some rare cases produce a different runtime behavior in the ide compared to stand of i could recommend the which is the only commercial r4 osgi implementation i know we are using the mbs internally for our products with success and the additional services remote management of distributed osgi and the lean design was the key to choose them over an opensource you exactly have to asses what you need and test for yourself to make the right there is no one rules them the key to go for one or another implementation are usually the things not defined in the spec in my	
there are two ways of defining a regex in through a regexp object re new using a string re should also note that js does not support some of the tenets of regular for a list of features unsupported in check out the you appear to be setting some flags on the expression the case insensitive i would suggest that you use the flag indicated by the syntax instead of using would make your regex as follows lookahead appears to be a very good article on the check out expressions in you are simply assigning this regex pattern to a regularexpressionvalidator then you will not have the ability to set regex options as ignore you will not be able to use the regex literal syntax supported by the only option that remains is to make your pattern intrinsically case for would have to be written as this would make your regex quite sorry to is a to this though i cannot vouch for some other options that come to mind may be to turn of client side validation altogether and validate exclusively on the this will give you access to the full regex flavour implemented by the use a customvalidator and create your own js function which applies the regex match using the patterns that i have

these data classes set one level above the primitives constraining data to make it they sit just above the and which is where talking about refactoring the validation code into a separate problem with refactoring the validation is that the regex necessary for validation exists only in the subclasses of since each subclass has a different this means that the validation data is only available to the not any of if i factor out the validation callers would need access to the class internal static readonly regex regex public string value regex enforced by so no values public password original original public static explicit operator string value new value when reading a value from the database or reading user the password constructor forwards the to the base class to handle the another trick is that it trims the end characters in case the database type is char rather than so i have to remember to do here is what the main constructor for regexconstrainedstring looks string regex if if throw new meet minimum length of if if throw new exceeds maximum length of if throw new value specified must match callers would need access to the i think my best bet is to implement a method in the which forwards the data to the method in the base in other i would add this line to the password static bool string value like this because replicating the subclasses constructor having to remember to trim the string again and pass the same lengths when this requirement would be forced upon all subclasses of and not something i want to these data classes like password is so because regexconstrainedstring handles most of the implementing there are other complications with factoring out the the validation involves running and storing a regex match in the since some data types may have properties that report on specific elements of the for my sessionid class contains properties like which return a matched group from the match stored in the data class the bottom line is that this static method is an entirely different since essentially incompatible with the constructor the constructor cannot use so i would end up replicating code once could factor out the validation code by replicating it and tweaking it for a static context and imposing requirements on or i could keep things much simpler and just perform the object the relative extra memory allocated would be as only a string and match reference is stored in the everything such as the match and the string itself would still be generated by the validation so no way around i could worry about the performance all but my experience has been that is more because correctness often leads to numerous other for i ever have to worry about improperly formatted or sized data flowing through my because only meaningful data types are which forces validation to the into the application from other be it database or of my validation code was removed as a and i find myself only checking for nulls having reached this i now understand why including nulls was billion dollar seems to be the only thing i have to check for even though they are essentially in my complex objects having these data types as fields cannot be constructed with but i have to enforce that in the property which is because they otherwise would never need validation only code that runs in response to changes in simulated the clr function calls both and found that when all data is the performance difference is only fractions of a millisecond per thousand which is when roughly half the passwords are throwing exceptions in the three orders of magnitude which equates to about 1 extra sec per 1000 the magnitudes of difference will of course multiple as multiple clr calls are made for multiple columns in the but a factor of 3 to 5 for my is an extra 3 5 second per 1000 updates acceptable to as a trade off for keeping my code very simple and that depends on the update if my application were getting 1000 updates per a 3 5 second delay would be on the other i was getting 1000 updates a minute or an it may be perfectly in my i can tell you now that quite so i think just go with the instantiation and allow the errors of in this test i handled the errors in the clr instead of letting sql server handle marshalling the error info to sql and then possibly back to the could definitely slow things down much i guess i will have to fully implement this to get a real but from this preliminary pretty sure what the results will

think that our method can be called best but it has served us have several large databases for our application so maintaining local copies on each developers computer has never really been an and even though we develop against the live we do need to do the development against a database that is as close to the real thing as a consequence we use a central web server as and keep a development branch of our subversion trunk on generally we work on the same part of the system at but when we do need to do or someone is making a lot of substantial we branch the trunk and create a new vhost on the dev also have a checkout of the code on the production so after finished testing we simply do a svn update on the production implemented a script that executes the update command on all servers using this is extremely since our code base is large and takes a lot of time to subversion will only copy the files that actually have been so a lot has worked really well for and the only thing to watch out for is making changes on the production servers directly of course is a from the since it might cause conflicts when

think the best way to begin to create a corporate framework is to begin by harvesting existing code out of current corporate building a framework from scratch by talking to a ba without writing code for a concrete project might lead you to over design the framework in some areas and totally miss some necessary features in others it might place artificial constraints on your framework clients for no good entry on and this for a more complete not familiar with web focus but guessing it would affect it in some if you go with a harvested your usage of it in the first few applications you build will shape how you use web focus within the

time taken to do a square root is much greater than the time taken to do an if you have been taught to avoid conditionals because they are then you have been they are a good deal slower than trivial operations like adding or subtracting integers or bit shifting which is why unrolling loops can be of benefit only if you are doing such trivial but in the grand scheme of things conditionals are good and not bad and to do something as complicated as call a function or calculate a square root to avoid a conditional statement is instead of x why not do 0 maybe the compiler will optimize them the but the second one simpler

two questions one is how to most efficiently gather the the other is how to deal with the data you how to gather from author a inner join book b on where is very avoid it if you inner joins are your least expensive way to compare tables especially if you have indexes on the primary keys and foreign there are authors without books be much of an author i use a left join syntax just change to if you are talking about 1000s of records you might want to think of gathering the data in two separate pulls your first choice i unless you want the user to wait forever for the page to for the user chooses all authors that begin with a and receives a list back you could even have a count of the articles from that titles author a inner join book b on by 35 18 3 the user clicks on the load the list of books for that froggy went a death on the life in you want it to appear like all done with one but you want it to come over really fast use xmlhttp or ajax to show the list of that is a whole other also should add that stored procedures are a the will add significantly to the portability of the app as well as to the performance in most

understand why git does not offer some kind of what you are referring to as an involving a you must first understand one of the of those scms clearcase for uses a version each version of an element or is linked in a direct relationship with the the previous version of the same uses a acyclic each of a file is actually part of a global set of changes in a tree that is itself part of a the previous version of that must be found in a previous accessible through a single directed acyclic graph a linear a config spec can specify several rules for achieving the you see a given first select a certain and if not then select another and if not then select a and so branch is a in a history a given version for a given select rule the other select rules before that one still hence the a a commit represents all the you will ever there is no selection of there is only one path in this graph to select all the files you will see at this exact point branch is just a new path in this in some other you must into your branch some other commit in the git mentioned by or your branch since git is a it will always result in a new you are with git is some kind of you are selecting different versions with different successive select but that would not be practical in a in when you are making a branch with you need to do so with a starting point a clearly defined and easily replicated to other a purely central you can define your workspace your either snapshot or with whatever rules you adds in the comment in his question once we see the two models can achieve different things vs my question which are the real life scenarios for companies more than where linear can do things not possible for are they worth it comes to in term of selection what you can do in a linear model is to have selection rules the same set of this for selection rules with alabel3 alabel2 selects all the files labelled branch from except for those labelled and branch from there that rule precedes the one mentioning it worth the ucm flavor of clearcase configuration methodology included with the clearcase and representing all the deduced from base clearcase does not allow for reasons of a set of files is called a and if you want to branch for a given label as a that would be translated like this following config alabel3 have to pick starting point and go from you want also the files from you will make a merge from all the files to the ones in is a you do not have to make with a where each node of the graph represents a uniquely defined for a whatever is the set of files and rebase are enough to combine that starting point with other versions of a given set of in order to achieve the desired while keeping that particular history in a general goal is to reason in version control operations applied to a set of files is one in a coherent its files are its files will branch from the starting is easily done in a dag it can be more difficult in a linear system with where the can be but it is enforced with the ucm methodology of that same of achieving that through a selection rule some select rule you achieve it only with vcs operations or which leave a clear trace for everyone to follow opposed to a config spec private to a or shared amongst some but not all it enforces a senses of opposed to a that you may have a hard time to reproduce later allows you to leave the realm of control and enter the realm of configuration which is mainly concerned with and that can be achieved with a or a

was the first have one or more mainboards with one or more cpu chips on the main problem here was that the cpus would have to expose some of their internal data to the other cpu so they get in their next step was one chip on the mainboard but it had some parts twice internally so it could execute two instructions at the same current development is basically the original idea complete but in a single the chip designers can easily put the additional wires for the sync signals into the chip of having to route them out on a then over the crowded mainboard and up into a second computers today are they have lots of mainboards with usually cpus on each cpu is and each has its own you got that pretty much just a few minor duplicates internal to reduce context switch resources can arithmetic unit you can do several integer or even floating point calculations or you can do an add and a multiply at the same time but not add and main problem with is that code running on them will eventually access the there are n cpus but only one bus to access the so you must have some hardware which makes sure that each cpu gets a fair amount of ram that accesses to the same part of the ram cause problems and most that cpu 2 will be notified when cpu 1 writes to some memory address which cpu 2 has in its internal if that cpu 2 will happily use the cached oblivious to the fact that it is imagine you have tasks in a list and you want to spread them to all available so cpu 1 will fetch the first element from the list and update the cpu 2 will do the for efficiency both cpus will not only copy the few bytes into the cache but a whole that may the assumption is when you read byte soon read both cpus have a copy of the memory in their cpu 1 will then fetch the next item from the without cache it have noticed that cpu 2 has changed the and it will start to work on the same item as cpu is what effectively makes so side effects of this can lead to a performance which is worse than what get if the whole code ran only on a single the solution was you can easily add as many wires as you need to synchronize the you could even copy data from one cache to another of a cache line without having to flush and reload or the cache logic could make sure that all cpus get the same cache line when they access the same part of real simply blocking cpu 2 for a few nanoseconds until cpu 1 has made its the main reason why is simpler than is that on a you simply run all wires between the two chips which need to make sync plus a signal only travels tops of in a you usually have much and forget on a signals start to influence each other we like to think that 0 is 0v and 1 is 5v but in is something between when dropping a line from and and is anything above you have everything inside of a single signals run much faster and you can have as many as you like almost signal crosstalk is much easier to

what does a singleton provides global access to an instance of an guarantees that no more than one instance of that type can be you use a singleton when you need of these that is are generally we tend to avoid them when building your application around the assumption that more than one instance it is an is because you typically find out the assumption perhaps you want to be able to create multiple instances for caching perhaps it turns out you need more than one more than one or perhaps threading performance requires you to give each thread its own any you need to enforce the one instance may if you only need one simply create only one but leave the constructor publicly visible so that more instances can be created it turns out to be other both of the features offered by a singleton are actually in we our data to be globally and we to take away flexibility for no you do need one of the features offered by a implement that one without the if you need something to be globally make it a not a and if you do need to enforce that only one instance will exist think of any plausible situations where want perhaps an object representing a physical hardware then implement without the global only real world application of singletons ever seen has been architect has read the gof and decided to cram design patterns in or programmer stuck in the comfortable with the whole and wants to code which means storing data as and singletons sounds like an way to make globals without getting yelled key point is that a singleton mixes very and each very rarely you want one of those in any given

when i switch branches in if the files are open in then emacs asks if i want to revert them it thinks changed on even though the contents are like to find a way for emacs to not ask me about it at all if the contents on disk are identical to those in the like a command that reverted all my open buffers that have no unsaved and queried me about those that do have unsaved be open to suggestions about other ways of etc i could fairly happy writing if people can give me pointers on where to using aquamacs on osx if that found the revbuffs package to be pretty much what i certainly enough to stop me wanting to try and write anything new mapped revbuffs to which works quite kind of similar to in other mac mode would have been a perfectly fine and i wish i could choose two i prefer revbuffs simply because of possibly feeling of wanting to be in control of what kind of guessed that if i accessed git from within then it could probably be handled but i currently prefer accessing git through the quite been using emacs long enough to make it my operating i will investigate magit a little more thoroughly been using magit for a year now and can highly recommend it for dealing with git from within however i still use revbuffs whenever i do a rebase outside of can i get emacs to revert all unchanged buffers when switching branches in

why do i get uzbekistan for the not selecting the item that grouping if you by get the expected however grouping by a different column so mysql know that is taking part in a and selects any old value from that in the join of it is possible you will see other countries than is part of a wider problem with mysql being permissive on what you can select in a group by for you can gender from registrations group by mysql will happily pick one of the gender values for a registration from each even though there is no direct causal link between country and other dbmss will refuse the above command on the grounds that there guaranteed to be one gender per as as registrations r join country c on by because a functional dependency between and you have correctly described your as a primary with rollup extension is a bit of a hack in the way it on the rollup row stage at the it runs over the entire result set to grab its and sets the column to also null other columns that have a functional dependency on that it probably but mysql currently really understand the whole thing about functional if you select it will show you whichever country name value it randomly and if you select it will show you whichever country id it randomly though is the join so must be the same as which is you can do to work around the problem by should be ok if are as well as and check that for being with rollup and do a separate query for the end this will be a little slower but it will also be ansi compliant so your app could work on other mysql has an option that is supposed to address this but it goes much too far and only lets you select columns from the group not columns that have a functional dependency on the group so it will make valid queries fail as making it generally

wonder how people are kicking people out or blocking access to a site when you want to do an upgrade and you have users that are logged one thought is to just put a bool setting in a global file as the settings for whether or not the site is true is while false is when the next time the user attempts to access the site they will either be logged out or just presented with an unavailable are 2 issues i can see with this users are just finishing filling in a long form or writing a large portion of text a new question or answer on as soon as they submit the lose that always save because there maybe db changes for that table or code may have changed on a busy editing the global file if more than a couple lines it might cause php parse errors if that page is loaded while partially uploaded or while there might also be locking issues on the depending on the option is to have a field in the database with the same at the i generally have a table for so this would be the only thing in the but i could see it being faster as it avoids the second there something that used that worked well or any other working with is the best method for taking a site down and kicking out users to do an

world is powerfull and full featured i think today obstacles are peoples this to say that using needs to take changes in in the way of thinkng architectures and answer you execution depends on more possible to fully customize the to take advantages of various features deffered future queries executed in a future multiple and last but not session management involves in this execution is based on concepts like and lazy this means that queries are executed against the database just qhen you perform some like accessing to methods of the nhibernate session like another example of deferred execution is with using of where just when you access to certain queries are queries are as i said beforre queries executed in a future ayende speaks well about queries are queries that can be together and executed in one time avoiding multiple roundtrips to the and this could be a very cool this is another chapter to but take in mind that if you manage well your or let nhibernate engine to manage well the sometime not needed to go to the dn to obtain all the tools like nhibernate generates queries for and parametrized queries are managed well with parameters even depending on the underlying db engine and conseguently db dialect you clear that frameworks like most of the use reflection at but needed to mention the multiple reflection optimization are see for example clear that or maybe all the time direct code could be but just in the in the big picture this could involve in more mistakes and about or better usefull to understand what you mean when talk about temp tables and temp in terms as as i support natively temp in the sense of runtime but this could be done because nhibernate permit to create object mapping at so a mechanism of temp data could be implemented using that hope i provided an usefull sorry for my bad

would be better than you really need a dictionary for each since column names are the same for all and if you want to have it you should use column indexes instead of if you have a column that is a 3rd to get its value from a row id the code would val option is depending on the way you access the data only or random could also use from the memory usage i think the best option would be to use a single dimension array with some slack so after say you would create a new copy the old contents to it and leave 100 empty rows at the but you would have to keep some sort of an index when you delete a so that it is marked as deleted without resizing the	
would be the ideal location to check in third party reference for a project in a version control typically i have seen most people to put them under so that the runtime can automatically pickup these however is that the right way to originally wanted to have a separate directory which is parallel to bin called lib which will contain all third party but this needs changes to the applications config file so that the lib directory is picked up by the run my idea over here is that lib will contain third party while bin will contain the projects binary be dll or is the preferred the concentration over is the location in the version control and not just the physical file of third party in version control for

wrong with cursors is that they are often both in and in are for keeping a stable resultset which you can retrieve they are implicitly created when your query is and closed when course keeping such a resultset requires some even faster these resources are the a cursor open is like keeping a fridge door do it for hours without but it does not mean you should never open your means get your results and sum you call the execute whole query and get the first results from the you append a condition to your for processing your cursors inside a procedure requires infamous context which happens every time you get a result of an query out of the involves passing large amounts of data between threads and synchronizing the is one of the most irritating things in of the less evident consequences of that behaviour is that triggers in oracle should be avoided if a trigger and calling a function is equal to opening the cursor selecting the updated rows and calling the trigger code for each row of this existence of the trigger the empty may slow down a operation or test script on create table int not 2 in 2 into 3 select 4 from 5 connect 6 level 7 rows in 2 in 0 truncate table 2 in 3 create trigger 2 after 3 on 4 for each 5 6 7 8 in 2 into 3 select 4 from 5 connect 6 level 7 rows in seconds without a seconds with an empty trigger doing

you and the compiler figure it this is why findbugs always suggests changing anonymous inner classes to named nested classes if they use their implicit tom hawtin tackline says that if the anonymous class is created in a static context in the the anonymous class is in fact but the jls anonymous class is never an anonymous class is always an inner class it is never an anonymous class is always implicitly java glossary the fact that anonymous classes are allowed in a static context is you want to baffle those maintaining your wags have discovered will permit anonymous classes inside init code and even though the language spec says than anonymous classes are never these anonymous of have no access to the instance fields of the i recommend doing the could be pulled at any the jls actually covers static contexts more explicitly in be the class being and let be the instance being if is an inner class then may have an immediately enclosing the immediately enclosing instance of is determined as is an anonymous the class instance creation expression occurs in a static context then has no immediately enclosing the immediately enclosing instance of is an anonymous class in a static context is roughly equivalent to a nested class in that it does not keep a reference to the enclosing even though technically not a	
you are depending on external resources such as your database and the configuration files when using the you writing very effective unit you will have to keep everything in sync including the data in the this because a maintenance you want to test this i recommend setting up your configuration to have membership can grab this from your you then will also want to set up a test database to connect it needs to be populated with fake so need scripts to make sure the data is would however recommend that you take the approach of doing more proper unit when we refer to a we mean testing a very small piece of code at a this code should not depend on anything so what you need to do is use interfaces and use or mocks so that your tests scope is enclosed to a single unit of you want to go this route i highly recommend reading effectively with legacy there are also plenty of other books and resources which talk about how to find seams and decouple your code so able to test once you get the hang of unit testing be glad you looked into

you can do as long as the widths of the elements to be distributed are known in but a bit trick you want a spacing between each element of that is width of the parent element minus the total width of all the child divided equally between the number of gaps between the css have the ability to do we have to hack it a first we add a margin to the parent element of the size the total width of all child so now the parent has width and we can use a padding value in relative to that for for four images of sizes 40px and 80px our is set that as the parent then the children can have of that width as padding between funny tag indentation is to avoid there being any whitespace between is necessary because with the parent width set narrower than the page it otherwise be possible to fit all the elements on the in ie you may need to add a wrapper div around the lot with to prevent unwanted scrollbars if spanning the whole and certainly want to be in standards can work with textual elements if you make them inline blocks so you can add and you size them explicitly in it work if the sizes of the child elements are not known in advance they contain dynamic as you know the value to be honest i would probably just use a the table layout algorithm copes very smoothly with calculating how to distribute spare table for best results with or to respond to dynamic this way you also have to worry about pixel rounding	
you can do not sure if call it a best but certainly a good idea to make rather rudimentary arrays a bit more if you need dynamic almost a requirement to group the various fields needed to do the bookkeeping you have two sizes in that one and one this is a tradeoff where you trade fewer allocations for some paying with a bit of memory times arrays are only used and are of static which is why the operator is so handy to determine the number of your syntax is slightly off with by the how it usually i sizeof array sizeof do stuff with each that is not a the parenthesis are not always one example of a wrapping exactly as that which you describe is the type provided by the part of the declaration is exactly what you struct gchar guint are expected to use the provided api to access the array whenever not poke these fields

you do protest too state on several occasions in the post that what you are proposing is ethical and you see nothing wrong with what you are about to an despite apparently being so sure of yourself you post it i can only see two motives for your protestations you do think it may be unethical and you are looking for support to back up your assertion that it do feel ethical but you recognise that other people may feel it is unethical and you want to reassure yourself that this will not be a widely held either case you recognise that there is a question over your proposed behaviour otherwise you would not post the and by posting you therefore yourself answer the question to your own mind your proposed behaviour or will be perceived to be by some ethically the real question you have to answer is is the degree of risk in choosing to take a course of action that you recognise as being ethically dubious to some degree justified by the potential this is a question only you can answer there is a risk for instance that your manager will be so off with you that you are sacked with a bad reference and will have great difficulty in finding another otoh success with the idea may mean you need to be looking for another

you have not found the code to be the slow part of the application via a profiler then you do anything about it it is but the code is and is and there are other slower areas that you can work on speeding up do those it is buggy then you need to fix it go for the hash table as it will be faster than the this assumes that the order that the data is traversed does not if you care about what the insertion order is then stick with the list can do things with a hash table and keep the but that will make the code much that you need to search the list only on occasion the odds of this being a significant bottleneck in your code is data structure to look at is a which basically lets you skip over a large portion of the this requires that the list be sorted depending on what you are may make the code slower

you have the data you even need to look at the an array from m is the number of over the polygons and increment the array entry of each vertex gives you an array that describes how many times each vertex is can then do another pass over the polygons and check the entry for each if 1 you know that vertex is shared by another can build upon this strategy further if you need to other for example instead of a count you could store polygons directly in the array allowing you to get a list of all faces that use a given vertex at this point effectively creating a map where vertex indices are the example assumes you have no degenerate but those could easily be

you mean to use and to refer to the same stepping out on a limb because i have a ton of experience with but do this the same way that do it in or by copying the remaining array elements down into their new that is sorted its contents are valid indices for the code would be something like the untested code bother copying any elements below the first selected writeindex readindex selectionindex if if the read pointer is currently at a selected then bump it up until past selected readindex remove the tail of the your remove algorithm still suffers from the flaw that as you remove items in you break the correspondence between the indices in and those in see try adding 3 then doing and then hit it will start by removing the 1st file in the list now what the 2nd and 3rd files in the list are at indices 0 and the next value taken from is 1 but what had been the file is at index so the former file gets spliced out of the leaving the former 2nd file and at index more see that this implementation only removes every other file in the is why my javascript code uses a and a to copy the entries in the skipping the over the indices that are to be this algorithm avoids the problem of losing correspondence between the array does need to be coded carefully to guard against various edge i tried some javascript code what i wrote it worked for suspect that the problem in your original test case the 2nd then adding is since only shown part of your i tell whether the array indices and the data in and are always going to match up i suspect that the problem is that they even if you fix the problem with using by adjusting the array index values still an algorithm in the general the array copy algorithm is

you need to post the data use one easy option is to create a form element on the attach input elements with the values you need and submit you can do that like so if you use var get the mail id of this not sure where since i have the html that makes if let me very first line is a jquery shortcut way of saying the document is done when the page is done going to attach an event listener to elements in the when one of those elements is we can then extract the mail id whatever else you that is in relation to that particular table if you had html like 8435 is the mail id in this we could extract the variable like we are going to attach a hidden form element to the end of the body of the html really matter where we put it since it is the end is in this form we set the method to post and the action to whatever php file you need to post i also set an id so easily referred to in the next now going to select the form element using its id and going to append a new hidden input element to it with the appropriate name value going to use the javascript submit method to trigger the submit event on the this is basically equivalent to pressing the button on a normal it it should work

you rewrite you current code so that it can be unit tested according all guidelines and that can be and you should estimate the cost and compare that the earnings is that you might discover a problem with the code and if done the reduction of the complexity as the result of the factors might save some time in the cost is the time and effort you have to spend both refactor your the test cases and also the extra time you might have to spend in the maintain the and the mocking code and that can be significant are comparing a known cost against a future risk and i am sure a lot of smart guys knows how to do but obvious that you can actually spend an infinite time refactoring and mocking without ever reducing the risk of failure to zero even at all if the code and problem is complex and you are messing things up when so you need to find a balance this as the code is it might be ok to be or and do black box testing or testing and just test the interface without bothering to mock the and you can argue that this is not a unit test but instead a system test or a function test it might give the best value for your money or your money or more time with your significant other at least more time to watch discovery you have old allow black box allow dependencies between the tests and compile a sequence of test that sets up the test data and manipulates and its at least tested automatically while not tested

you use the the index when using the scroll the item under the mouse changes which will also lead to the if your event handler is intensive when the index it will slow down the scrolling as it will run each time the selected index changes each time your scroll with the mouse or you should use to handle when the selection changes instead as this will only fire once the combo is you use the mouse wheel when the combo is not dropped if that is the then it is still the selection change handling as each roll of the wheel will change the committed scrolling when the combo is dropped down does not do recommend you add some kind of selection filter using a you start the timer each time the selection is only when the timer fires do you actually handle the selection this you scroll with the mouse wheel without incurring a selection penalty each make sure to stop the timer when it of

your not actually being allowed to access bad memory directly since interfacing through the nsarray happening is that giving the object a bad and it is informing you by throwing an exceptions that happen on the main thread of an nsapplication application do not cause the application to they log the error and abort the current run loop cycle and then start the next more information on how you can deal with these exceptions during your debugging please take a look at it describes various techniques and responses you can use when dealing with application level reading and writing bad memory always cause the application to why those kinds of errors can be so hard to track you could simply be corrupting other objects and have no idea that done so until much latter in the the important thing to remember here is that nsapplication will squash most exceptions happening on the main so you have to pay extra attention to
