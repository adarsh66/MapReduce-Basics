a application i am i need to locally cache assemblies from various locations so my application can use them even if the original locations are i cannot use the gac because i want portability and also because the assemblies might not be anyone know of any code which supports this functionality i need the cache to be able to tell me if a particular assembly is already in the cache and handle different versions of assemblies as it is likely that i will have to resort to writing my own assembly but i thought i would ask this question because i really want to the if it has already been your own assembly

a biassed observer work for ibm on treat my comments with due your applications are written in informix you would have to do major surgery to move them to other you would need to decide which alternative interface to use your choice c as the basic is but oracle provides the oci and sybase provides the tds as with informix an upgrade to the current version clientsdk containing which more recent than the which you currently should be painless unless gone out of your way to write bad simply migrating the data might be a little traumatic not insuperably in the complexity depends on which data types you strings migrate date and time values less for but migrating the applications would require a lot of as you unless you were extraordinarily prescient and wrote a really good data abstraction upgrade to informix se would be a get the install point it at your existing probably want to recompile your programs to use the more modern but you could do that incrementally with care informixdir one for the old one for the upgrade to informix dynamic server would require you to export the data from se and import it into this would be very simple once you have ids up and getting ids up and running takes more effort than but is not all that my recommendation is to stay put with the decision is of would we have to make code changes or just is very closely related to but they are ids provides an almost strict superset of se the places i can think of where there are differences are primarily edge case has extra syntax to create table for locating files for the ids has a wholly different set of the basic create table is the same ids has types that se such as but the adornments are has create audit and drop audit and ids does not has other audit has start database and rollforward ids does not and logging in ids is main area that may cause issues is transaction ids has logged and mode as does in you are encouraged to use a logged database that would be a strong ids provides atomic statements in a logged database either the statement works as a whole or it fails as a many se applications are not written with transactions in there are some things you do when there are transactions on the such as open a cursor for update outside the scope of a this is what tends to bite code migrating from se to you cannot lock a table except in a and you cannot unlock a table except by commit or much of a problem this will be depends on what you were using in se and how the programs were designed they were designed rather than thrown an ids unlogged database and an se unlogged database are very close and you could migrate from one to the but ids can do things only when the databases are and you should aim to be using logged the migration to csdk should be just a recompile unless managed to do some really excruciatingly awful

a comment on an answer asked about what in means to the type rather than an instance of the you access a static member another using the type name instead of a reference or a for static so called using type someguid instance called on a asstring static classes are usually used as the canonical example is probably it make sense to create an instance of math it just a few rules and classes always derive from you specify a different base or make the static class implement an classes have any instance members all methods etc must be classes declare any instance constructors and the compiler create a parameterless constructor by static classes came in people would often create an abstract class with a private which prevented no need classes are implicitly abstract compiled to il which describes an abstract but you add the modifier classes are implicitly sealed compiled to il which describes an sealed but you add the modifier classes be classes be in either or static classes have nested either or classes can contain extension methods

advice is sound if you are you need to worry about freeing the memory since the system will reclaim it exception to that is shared memory segments at least under system v shared those segments can persist longer than the program that creates option not mentioned so far is to use an memory allocation built on top of standard if the entire application uses a single your cleanup code can release that and all is freed at apache portable runtime provides a pools feature which i believe is david interfaces and provides an memory allocation written one that you could use if you wanted you can think of this as garbage a general memory every time you allocate memory you should understand which code is going to release it and when it can be there are a few standard the simplest is in this released before this function this keeps the memory largely under control you run too many iterations on the loop that contains the memory and scopes it so that it can be made available to the current function and the functions it you have to be reasonably sure that the functions you call are not going to squirrel away pointers to the data and try to reuse them later after released and reused the next standard pattern is exemplified by and a function that allocates a pointer to some which can be used by the calling and then released when the program has finished with this often becomes very similar to the first case it is usually a good idea to call in the function that called of the remaining are somewhat

agree with paul that this is often solved by using a soft reference though it may evict entries earlier than you a usually acceptable solution is to use a normal cache that evicts to the soft and recovers entries on a miss if this victim caching approach works pretty giving you a lower bar but extra benefit if free memory is memory size can be determined by enabling the java and usage is pretty simple when using the sizeof utility only used this for debugging and recommend benchmarking the overhead before adopting it for normal my caching i am planning on adding the ability to plug in a evaluator once the core algorithm is this way you could store a collection as the but bound the cache by the sum of all collection i have seen unbounded collections as values in caches cause so having control is quite you really need and advise not we could enhance my current implementation to support you can email

am working a current web application for a client and i am having some trouble with session variables disappearing on i will try and set up a good description of the scenario as best i it does not happen on any page other than the page i created to allow users to modify the strings stored in a resource shows up navigate to the select a resource file from a list and click edit a first the page loads the file into a gridview and allows them to edit at this point the session variables are being saved a reloaded correctly upon all they click the save button at the bottom to write the resource file to the filesystem they select a new file from the attempt to load it and this time the session variables are cleared out and it redirects them to the login page because it does not know there user only happens when they click a save button which in turn calls my procedure to write to the resource am not really doing much in the save function besides writing to a resource file located in and for some reason this clears out my session session variable in question is there user which i attempt to get as the very first thing in a session information is also executed upon every postback via the i hope i described this well disappearing session	
am working on a ai using a technique known as i am attempting to train a network that can move around a two dimensional space given a variety of values that are stored in what is effectively a two dimensional can see two strategies for using the neural each in the provide the scores from the different heuristics as inputs to neurons and create a nn that is effectively a very complicated move the non playing character to the location with the highest a compressed value for each heiuristic measure compressed into as few bits as and provide an input neuron for each of these am quite interested in option two because it presents the least amount of calculations required runtime of the game is quite however i am confused as to what approach i could use to create the version of the heiuristic i know there are techniques such as fourier transformations out however i know if these will suit my basically i am looking for a way to convert a 50x50 array of doubles into one or maybe two double these two double values can be i need to be able to get the original values i just need a reasonable mechanism for changing the input data into a small alternative to these two possibilities is to somehow encode a based on some distance from the npc you get the actual values for a and an approximation for a i know exactly how i would wire this but it at least gets rid of the need to evaluate every cell every turn of the game i am looking at about 5 million rounds at approximately 1 second per any simplification i can come up with would greatly apologise if this making much it is quite a difficult problem that has stumped me for a and i think of an easy way to describe to add change to chris refined what i am looking what i am looking for is a way to approximate a line can convert the 2d map into a in as few parameters as i have used cubic splines for interpolation however i need something a lot more feasable for a that varies between and quite what i am realling looking for i suppose is a of the know there are techniques such as cubic splines that i can work out some and these values are a reasonable analogy for what i am looking i need a way to take the 2500 values and come up with a small representation of these values that i can use for the neural i think the nn can be trained to infer the true meaning of these or at least to determine some correlation between the representation and the real so it necessarily need to be a reversible but i think many one way functions as are actually going to be very helpful a 2d map of doubles in as few as

and squeak are first and foremost very it is fairly easy to create a gui using you just draw a few copy some text the haloes of very much every morph allow for cloning and then you can drop these morphs into your new it is more difficult to add your behaviour to the ui you just created since you somehow have to find your widget in the code is the part where i would like to point out that i find the morphic implementation in squeak very maybe mistaken all of but this is how i see morphic was designed to allow you to graphically construct your own ui with just a few and it was designed so in the self programming where there is no registering your clone into the ordinary code tree is a triviality in is of course not trivial to export your but then in smalltalk that is never easy the real world morphic code that i come across usually treats morphs like any other ui framework creating the ui from ignoring the graphical i have not seen a convenient way to a morphic ui into a file the way interface builder does on mac os more if you click together a morphic it is difficult to access it from the code hint from neil to leave the whole morphic thing aside and turn to mvc might be the few times i have had to deal with user interfaces in i examined ui generation code from around the image and tried to mimmick their

another thread that is constantly pinging the server really the best you can do since a socket is not an active	
answer given by covers pretty well most part of the i will now deal with the very last paragraph as simply as i should be implemented for for your derived class to be reused in old not for your class reusing parts of the base class can use aggregation for that if you have a class that is to be used on new code with some new but should be used transparently as a former then inheritance is your new code can use the new functionality and old code will seamlessly use your new this is the general there are some common the line here is subtle and your question is about precisely that if you have a collection of objects of type that should be because those objects are meant to be used only with they are behave like techniques as or downcasts in to detect the real runtime type is something that i would flag in a code review and only accept after having the programmer explain to great detail why any other option is worse than that i would accept for in answer under the premises that the information is not available with the given operations in that the base type does not have any method that would offer enough information for the caller to determine the and if it does not make sense to include such besides the prepresentation are you going to perform any operation on the objects based on that same if logic depends on the real then the operation should be in base class to be overriden in derived if that is not possible operation is new and only for some given there should at least be an operation in the base to allow the caller to determine that a downcast will not and then i would really require a sound reason for the caller code to require knowledge of the real why does the user want to see it in different will the user perform different operations on each one of the you endup requiring to use code to bypass the type your design has a strange to of never say but you can surely avoid depending on or downcasts for

answer this in terms of but other programming environments can be add that this solution is valid to solve the problem in any number of dimensions that we have two line segments in pq and here are a few random sets of p q r s infinite line is easily defined p we r that for each when the parameter is at 0 or we get one of the original endpoints on the line we know that and way of defining a line parametrically is very useful in many imagine we were looking down along line can we find the point of smallest distance from the line segment rs to the infinite line this is most easily done by a projection into the null space of line n is a pair of basis vectors that span the two dimensional subspace orthogonal to the line r s what we have done is to project the vector rs into the 2 dimensional subspace orthogonal to the line by subtracting off p point on line to get r and we ensure that the infinite line passes through the origin in this projection we have reduced this to finding the minimum distance from the line to the origin in the projection recall that the line is defined by the parameter v r normal vector to the line will give us what we since we have reduced this to 2 dimensions because the original space was we can do it just have used null this little trick works in n n is now a vector with unit the distance from the infinite line to the origin is d that i could also have used to get the same the actual distance is but as it turns d was positive here d we determine v from recall that the origin is a distance of d units from the line that connects points r and therefore we can write r for some value of the scalar form the dot product of each side of this equation with the vector and solve for v tells us that the closest approach of the line segment rs to the origin happened outside the end points of the line so really the closest point on rs to the origin was the point out from the this tells us that the closest point on line segment rs to the infinite line pq was the point is one more step in the analysis to what is the closest point on the line segment does this point fall inside the line or does it too fall outside the project the point s onto the line expression for u is easily enough derived from similar logic as i did note here that used to do the u that u lies in the interval we have solved the the point on line pq p the distance between closest points on the two line segments all of this can be compressed into just a few short lines of but it helps to expand it all out to gain understanding of how it

are some general steps that will get you on your you must change your settings so that it creates pdb even for release later versions of the compiler do this by but in many versions of visual you must do this create program database and then keep an archive of those files along with each build of your it is critical that every build of your applications has its own set of you just reuse the same ones you made with build 10 to examing the dumps generated by build for over the life of your you will end up with a ton of so be prepared for you need to be able to identify the exact version of your application which generated the dump if you are creating your own minidumps calling for probably the easiest way to do this is to simply make part of the filename of the minidump the complete version number of your need to have a reasonable version numbering scheme in place for this to in my we increment the build number across all branches by one every time the autobuilder creates a that you have recieved the dump file from the you know the precise version of the application that created the and you have found the pdb files for this you need to go through your source history and find the source code for this exact version of the the best way to do this is to apply to your branches every time you make a set the value of the label to the exact version and it becomes easy to find in the almost ready to fire up the complete source tree for that version of your put it in a seperate place on your hard say for application version build the binaries for that exact version of your application and put them somewhere on your hard it might be easiest simply to install that version of your application to get the the pdb files in the same location as the binaries in step you have two options for viewing the dump you can use or using visual studio is but windbg is much more most of the time the functionality in visual studio will use visual all you have to do is open the dump file like it is a once the dump file by and if all the paths are set correctly it will take you right to the code that give you a call use you have to jump through a couple of the dump by windbg to go get the correct microsoft symbol type this may take a few moments as it will pull a ton of stuff down from the windbg where the symbols type substituting wherever you put the pdb files for the make sure you get the plus sign in there with no whitespace between and the sign or else screw up step windbg where the source code type substituting the path where you got code from source control for this version of the windbg to analyze the dump type a few if everything is configured windbg will take you right to the location of your at this point you have a million options for digging deep into your memory the state of critical but that is beyond the scope of this

avoiding recursion is a good thing on all embedded only does it lowers or even removes the chance of a it often gives you faster code as can always rewrite a recursive algorithm to be not always practical though a way to get around this is to rewrite the algorithms in a way that the recursion depth is introsort is a perfect example how done in it limits the recursion depth of a quicksort to log2 so on a 32 bit machine you will never recurse deeper than written quite a bit of software for embedded platforms in the past entertainment and the and i always made sure that i put a upper limit on the recursion depth or avoided recursion at the first a result none of my programs ever died with a and most programs are happy with 32kb of this pays off big time once you need multiple threads as each thread gets own you can save megabytes of memory that	
based on your the transformation you specified that you want is exactly what is accomplished with matrix3d in flash they changed it from a 3x3 matrix to a 4x4 matrix to allow the skewing you are trying to if you are using flash matrix3d is your if try out as3 3d engines such as papervision or you are using flash then look up matrix3d object in flash because it allows even more skewing of the actual 3d prolly exactly what you are looking for than that the transformation matrix is what does it is a object that can be accessed on any displayobject using can be tricky to get used but this is the most comprehensive source i know of for dealing with matrix article is for flash but the functionality has changed almost none into so it is still a valuable

be in for most of us to decide which platform to build upon ie to a winning platforms may not even exist yet but perhaps by picking a player today with a large installed base one can hope for migration tools to the winners when and google are two such large players and have taken very different routes to cloud services their own systems are built on different and both look like being among the first wave of new builds i would consider its programming model disconnects data code from hardware detail enabling gae to handle application scaling without requiring developers to modify their data or gae is the brave new world and as such favours the system mature so need to gamble that your development requirements curve too far ahead of the gae development curve now a tough call to an existing offers the most mature renting virtual machines is cheaper than renting physical amazon have to help you manage scalability but manage it you will still have to if you need specific implementations such as ms c postgresql then amazon offers a path for such can one expect amazon to offer a cloud service more akin to it would be a logical

best approach to migrating to a usable willing to break every application that currently uses the your options are because you change the existing structure very you think carefully about your motivations if you have an existing issue bug to an enhancement to then go ahead rarely worthwhile to monkey around with a working production system just to achieve an improvement that nonone else will ever note that this can play into your favour if an existing you can point out to management that the most way to fix things is to alter the database structure in this means you have management support for the changes and their backup if something turns pear practical thoughts one change at a and one make sure each change is correct before you move the old proverb of cut is automate never ever make the changes to the production system using sql server management write sql scripts that perform the entire change in one develop and test these against a of the database to make sure you get them use production as your test server you might accidentally run the script against use a dedicated test server the database size is under use sql server express running on your own the first step in any script should be to backup the so that got a way back if something does go if someone comes to you in twelve asking why feature of their application is need a history of the exact changes made to the database to help diagnosis and first good step is to keep all your change usually a good idea to keep the primary and foreign keys within the database and not revealed through the things that look like keys at a business level your work order have a disturbing habit of having introduce your keys as additional columns with appropriate but change the definitions of existing

best guess is that the 2nd time you call openconnection you closed it and so you try to set the connectionstring property of an already open this in you want your methods to actually create a new connection every time along the lines of the factory so that the connection can be properly something more like sqlconnection better if the connection string is pulled from a config var result new connection string return will be no corresponding rely on the idisposable pattern to make sure the connection is always closed then you will use that function and connection in a method like datatable var result new string sql from where using cn using cmd new using rdr return statements work with any object that implements the idisposable and they guarantee your connection is closed even if an exception is notice that i made the method this is because this class will become your data access by making the connection you will enforce a good db layer where the only way to talk to the db is to come through this code that needs to talk to the db should go in if this class starts to get too big you can mark this method as rather than private and move your data access layer into own assembly project in visual the key is now to limit your methods to accepting input for try to build an generic method that lets you pass in the sql that way lies never connect to a database from your application via the sa and posting your sa account details to a public web site just that	
best solution have already been i just want to add some simplest solution is to have a counter and increment on every new this works quite well as long as only one thread creates new if multiple processes or even systems add new things get a bit more you must coordinate the creation of new ids with locking or any similar synchronisation you could also assign id ranges to every proceses to reduce the synchronisation or extend the file id by a unique process better solution might be to use guids in this scenario and do not have to care about synchronisation between you can at some random data to every identifier to make them harder to guess if this is a coommon is storing files in a directory structure where the location of a file depends on its file might be stored as this avoids directories with a huge number of i am not really aware why this is done may be file system performance issues but it is quite i do not know if similar things are common if the files are stored directly in the	
best way is to add the directory to the load path and then the basename of each this is because you want to avoid accidentally requiring the same file twice often not the intended whether a file will be loaded or not is dependent on whether has seen the path passed to it for this simple irb session shows that you can mistakenly require and load the same file require require require require that the first two lines return meaning the same file was loaded both when paths are even if the paths point to the same know that the file was already we add a directory to the load path and then require the basename of each file require you care about the file being required more than or your intention is just to load the contents of the perhaps should be used instead of use load in this because it better expresses what trying to for load file

can understand how one can write a program that uses multiple processes or a new process and use or create multiple threads and use those sorts of communication also understand context that with only once the operating system schedules time for each process there are tons of scheduling algorithms out and thereby we achieve running multiple processes now that we have processors we could have two processes running simultaneously on two separate question is about the last how does the kernel control which core a process runs which system calls or even schedule a process on a specific reason working on a project for school where we are to explore a recent topic in computing and i chose there seems to be a lot of material on how to program in that kind of environment to watch for deadlock or race but not much on controlling the individual cores i would love to be able to write a few demonstration programs and present some assembly instructions or c code to the effect of i am running an infinite loop on the 2nd look at the spike in cpu utilization for specific code or for clarification many people have said that this is the purpose of the and that one should let the os take care of i completely but then what asking trying to get a feel is what the operating system actually does to do not the scheduling but more a core is what instructions must be executed to have that core start fetching to control which core a process runs

contract types in a common assembly is a really good it gives you the chance to add for to convert between the contract types and other business objects you may or between those makes sense to use common types if you do not control all suppose you have a service that is consumed by internal apps that use and also by trusted third parties at a partner the partner apps use or or in this case the partner have access to the shared but relying on the can roll their own type that should not preclude you from providing a nice package of shared types to your recommendation to share types also applies when you use a rest interface as opposed to with wsdl is lacking but xsd would still be used to describe the types of the messages that the server and its clients so no change in advise regardless of whether you use soap or it applies whether you use or java or anything if you control both ends of the wire and the platforms are the then you should share why

could add the id value to the end of the name when a record is so when someone deletes id 3 the name becomes and then when they delete id 100 the name becomes this would allow you to create a unique composite index on the name and deleted fields but you then have to filter the name column whenever you display it and remove the id from the end of the a better solution would be to replace your deleted column with a column of type you could then maintain a unique index on name and deleted with a record having a null value in the this would prevent the creation of multiple names in an active state but would allow you to delete the same name multiple obviously need to do a test when undeleting a record to ensure that there is no row with the same name and a null field before allowing the could actually implement all of this logic within the database by using an trigger for the this trigger would not delete records but would instead update the column when you deleted a following example code demonstrates table swtest id int name datetime trigger on swtest of delete update swtest set where id in from and is null required to prevent duplicates when deleting already deleted records unique index on into swtest values into swtest values from swtest where id into swtest values from swtest where id into swtest values from swtest table select from this query returns the name thingy1 thingy2 thingy2 thingy2 within your code you can delete records using a normal delete and let the trigger take care of the the only possible issue i could was that deleting already deleted records could result in duplicate hence the condition in the trigger to not update the field on an already deleted

create a data class for each kind of data i i do not use and except within those data my data classes have meaningful and are used in contexts where the particular constraints are if you have a field that is only meaningful with values between 1 and then you have storing it in an whose range is to if you do have fun trying to validate it redundantly everywhere you pass and have fun figuring out when and where you need to validate and have fun when you forget a spot and let invalid data sneak into your and have fun trying to explain to me how a bug not the fault is possible in software written for deterministic digital to you are accepting a score from a text field in a perform on it at the point of giving error messages appropriate for that particular user the preliminary validation can be complex as you need it to to provide meaningful feedback to the performed the initial stuff the data in an appropriate meaningful data class like where the constructor will perform the this authoritative validation should be as simple and efficient as but absolutely sufficient for guaranteeing the value is a boolean the data is either valid or an exception is thrown appropriate for a programmer to if your data validation code for simply a regular expression consider including the data class the regular expression and the data itself in the error all basic data classes should be like the string class once it is guaranteed to be valid and remain preliminary validation code may or may not leverage the data validation it depends on how detailed the data collecting and how much feedback you want to send to the more complex classes you which contain data classes as should not be constructable unless they are so you may need to write code that validates or attempts to construct each individual data catch the construction and handle them by providing more appropriate feedback to the this feedback can involve coloring a field red and displaying an error message next to so as you can there are two kinds of and one is clearly more complex out of

creating a new mvc so far used the account controller for actions related to a account activation but i use register for other actions in the site so renamed contact up to been concentrating on the administrative user at the point where going to start creating the various views that users will these are rather limited compared to the administrative my inclination is to create a new set of views and associated controller in the user instead of using the account is this a good idea or should i stick with the account my feeling is that since this is for ordinary users it should be a separate controller since account would apply to both ordinary and administrative after reading the first couple of my refactored question you consider the account controller to be for administrative actions related to the account or for all actions on the would you distinguish between related and application related to the extent of creating a new but directly answer my use existing account or create new user

definitely a good idea to keep fairly close to the current by not upgrading you save on any immediate but you save an enormous amount of work for later on in the life typically those who make the conservative decision will be long gone by the time the absolute critical need to upgrade occurs so they away there it is up to us as technical resouce to point out that short term pain is better than a complete project meltdown shining example of this is a massive system written on oracle which is still on oracle today it fails next to impossible to patch as that version is too and will be thrown away as soon as anyone has the political cajones to make it the cost of not upgrading would currently be running at in specialist and lack of compatibilty with other line is not upgrading means big dollars being spent

depends very much on what you are if you are working on internal things then the advice of do them until is you are making an api that is to be consumed by other developers then changing things around to interfaces at a later date can be good rule of thumb is to make interfaces out of anything that needs to be this is not an make an interface in that sort of you still need to think about the short answer is this works with both internal things and providing an is that if you anticipate more than one implementation is going to be needed then make it an that generally would not be interfaces would be classes that only hold like say a location class that deals with x and the odds of there being another implementation of that is	
depends what you are trying to unit tests with collaborators mocked out are great are really are small and easy to have dependencies on the wider world which makes them easy to provide excellent defect pure unit tests cannot tell you if you have configured your objects correctly in your ioc if the database connection string works you need a test which runs up your ioc container and really reaches out to the db to prove these you write as many of your tests as standalone unit tests as possible then your build will stay this is as a slow bulid gets run even forget to add a sprinkling of wired tests to prove that your we have a test for every service in our container that proves that we can request it from the ioc this proves wired from then on it is unit tests all the we have lots of pure unit whole lot is then wrapped in some application level functional tests to prove that the app itself does what the user thing to bear in mind is the time cost of each test moving from pure unit wired functional tests costs an order of magnitude of execution time and complexity when they

developing and loading oracle xml gateway message there are several methods you can employ to track they are all manual and require setting a standard within a development from version tracking tools like svn each time you change a message you can change the map name in the properties then each time you load the you will be able to choose which version you want to from the trading partner setup in the xml if your question is how to compare two existing map files to find the differences between the most effective way is to start two sessions of message tile them and move through them side by identifying which elements are mapped to which is relatively straightforward you are comparing slight variations of the same source and target definitions and you can focus particularly on elements or levels that have a blue circle icon in the element mapping tab where the logic used becomes true that the map files themselves are in but it is of little use to compare the xml one to the other using a comparison really no substitute in this instance for human using the message designer tool to compare exposes the logic and the and post process procedures as well as the elements this if i have misunderstood the question please feel free to elaborate and be happy to answer xml gateway	
devoted a large number of lines of c code to for failed memory allocation by the family returning i was taught that this was a good practice so on memory an appropriate error status could be flagged and caller could potentially perform memory and i now have some doubts about this philosophy that hoping to clear guess that a caller could deallocate excessive buffer space or strip relational objects of their but find the the caller rarely has the is at the appropriate level of to do from the called function without side effects is often also just discovered the linux oom which seems to make these efforts totally pointless on my primary development linux follows optimistic memory allocation this means that when there is no guarantee the memory really is this is a really bad in case turns out that the system is out one or more processes be killed by the infamous figure there are probably other platforms out there that follow the same there something pragmatic that makes checking for oom conditions i bother detecting oom of errors in my c	
did five years of work and then switched to and found i disliked most of the ides as especially which imho is a royal pain and is only popular because some people have been using for it for finally tried intellij and decided to buy there are a lot of things i could fault with with larger it spends what feels like hours analyzing code on and when it detects a change can happen under certain cirumstances when you clean your during this time you use the it also would crash for a period of a although after sending five different stack dumps to jetbrains the issue was finally fixed in a new compared to willing to work with the issues i had with eclipse never seemed as large as the few had with but they were always annoying and took a lot of time to tweak and there also seemed to be a lot of happening all the and it made me feel like the ide was never it seemed far too easy to screw up the work environment and make eclipse simply not this is all subjective of but other members of my team had similar we could never quite blame eclipse flat out for not yet we seeemed to have to spend about a day or so every couple of months totally reinstalling it because the delicate balance of plugins was somehow disrupted and the thing would just not work how we wanted it members of my team use net beans only played with a so i put it in i prefer there are a lot of really neat tools included with and the editor has these which detect what kind of project working on if it uses gwt or and can detect a lot of mistakes that normally discovered until runtime and notify you in the ide with installing plugins is a intellij looks the most like visual studio of any of the java the way it organizes project files is also somewhat similar with analogous concepts to solution and project files compared to eclipse or netbeans i also think it has the nicest key bindings of any ide ever

difference between cocoa touch and cocoa is in the area of memory you happen to be learning for the very first time possibly any language for the very first i would start with cocoa reasoning is that the iphone does not support automatic garbage and you may find it easier to learn the certainly less way then as you migrate to os x development appreciate the shortcuts that the os x platform gives you learn cocoa development on leopard you may be frustrated at the seemingly more primitive memory management available in the two are very line is if you want to learn to program for the go ahead and jump to the mac os x development is not a just a very similar	
differences can seem but they are not every language makes the same but in a makes the type and name of the variable known to the allocates storage and specifies an initial value for the can combine a variable declaration and definition into one as is commonly x a variable inside a function will also set aside memory for the so the following code implicitly defines variable as a part of its int return variable is automatically defined by the it will contain whatever value was in the memory location that was allocated for this is why it is not safe to use automatic variables until explicitly assigned a known value to takes place any time you change the value of a variable in your similar to the variable makes the function signature known to the this allows you to call a function in your source code before it is defined without causing a compiler specifies the return parameter and instructions for a the first three of these elements must match the function a function must only be defined once in a given x 0 x return can combine the function decalartion and definition into but you must do so before the function is called anywhere in your the the

do this using what lennaert calls a coordinator call this a i come from java web development and the idea was a form of run into some issues with the workflowcontroller runs a each command represents a workflow or a series of related steps the name the flowcontroller handles the naviagation between commands and a flowcontroller has a navigator that navigates between the each step has a finish event the presenter gets wired and nextstep method that we use to navigate to the next our worflowcontroller is tightly coupled to the menu so we can navigate between different workflows the steps establish the link between view and we have any configuration and have hardwired the logic that establishes the next step to execute into a method called it is in but not very satisfied with too much detail to get into thought about shifing to something that is more event we use a message bus to do all of our other communication and like to shift to using this to navigate between i know if that would be helpful or our screens for the most part consist of sequential

doing a little it turns out that the directx error routines are not shipped as shipped as libs that you statically link into your i should have figured this based on the size of way larger than any of the other stub to get this to work i did the a native dll that wraps all the error handling lib since there are only 3 dxgeterrorstring and this that big a call the wrapper can do this in visual studio by creating a win32 project application settings so that a dll and so that it exports i called min the wrapper project add a passthrough for the i called mine tchar return extern block is important to do with demangling the this project will need to and statically link so have to add the directx sdk include dir to your include path and the directx sdk lib dir to your lib have your managed code import the call from your wrapper public extern string 2005 native projects use unicode by default so the dllimport needed to specify call it from managed code this case the call prints function completed to the debug device since 0 is post looks like one of the directx functions not pretty sure it ships with unicode and ansi will map to unicode when compiled on unicode t is a mnemonic for unicode on multibyte characterset on ansi can usually use but if that causes compatability problems gotta use ansi strings because of some struct that already ported requires you can use whichever is consistent with your project if all unicode or you should have no problem marshaling it into a you may need to decorate it as though the return value may be out too wish directx shipped tlbs following the standard

dragon has a small section about what you use regular expressions detect repetition of a meaning you match constructs like where w is the same succesion of can only detect a fixed number of repetition or an unspecified number of which is to say you use an already parsed token to determine the number of something s1 s2 expressions be used to describe balanced or nested the set of strings of all balanced 1 and a simple you a substring so you can match it if you than you would be using a just think of how you would be using regular expressions for those and you will intuitively come to the conclusion you the same as the problem in for parsing string you just say a string literal is between the first and the second but what happens when an escaped for the relation to i think hunch is because the problem is limited introspection the book has references to the if you want i can look them up for	
driven architecture is the idea that you create models which express the problem you need to solve in a way that is free of any at least implementation and then you generate implementation for one or more specific the claim is that working at a higher level of abstraction is far more powerful and in your models outlive technologies you still have something when your first language platform becomes obsolete that you can use for your next generation another key claimed benefit is that much of the boilerplate and can be once the computer understands the semantics of your it can help you claim this approach is 10 times more and that it is we will all be building software in 10 this is all just i am wondering what the outcomes are when the rubber meets the the version of mda is from the and seems very it is heavily based on which might be considered good or bad depending on who you ask leaning towards in spite of those it is hard to argue with the idea of working at a higher level of abstraction and the computer to understand the semantics of your problem and imagine a series of er models which simply express and then imagine using those to generate a significant portion of your first in one set of technologies and then again in another set of love to hear from people who really are doing mda right now or what tools are you how is it working how much of the theoretical promise have you been able to do you see a true 10x effectiveness you doing mda driven right if what tools do you and how is it working

for about a second the alt attribute given this case then it hides and shows the image when the image is what alt text is it provides a textual alternative for when the image because an or images are turned off in the browser in this the file just arrived alt text really what you unless the image in question actually contains the words the above is inappropriate alt if talking about one of those little icons that opens a a better alt text would be as a description of what the image opposed to what it would be better applied to the attribute used for that if using quirks mode and the image has a fixed size firefox will use a icon with the alt text overlaid and cropped instead of the plain alt text on its this is to match old but you really want to use quirks and in the common case where the fixed size is the cropping makes the alt text unreadable and is a problem because during that split second the layout stretches to fit the wider words making it look unprofessional in my getting over how the web any page can move about a bit as it renders for images you should only ever see it happen then the image will be cached and will appear straight if it something wrong with the cacheing on what kind of layout you are talking you can perhaps fix that to not respond to the changing image for example if using a setting on the table and number on the top image cell will make it stick to that width even if the text inside is possibly causing the alt text to run over into the next cell

functions almost never return a instead they return a or use special values to indicate error returns they store the error code in a which you can read with instructs the marshaler to read this variable after the native function and stash the error code where you can later read it with the idea is that the runtime may call other win32 functions behind the scenes which mess up the error code from your call before you get a chance to inspect which return a belong to a different level of abstraction than win32 generally these functions are or from so they use the win32 code might call win32 functions instructs the marshaler to check the return and if not a success to create and throw an exception containing the the managed declaration of your function then has as its return the or vb compiler cannot check the unmanaged so it has to trust whatever you tell if you put on a function which returns something other than a you will get strange results random if you put on a function which does not set the last win32 error you will get garbage instead of a useful error	
functions like usually get a character from the keyboard or standard they are sometimes used at the end of programs like do many know what the e stands for in are then used to give the user the change to see the output of the before the terminal windows closes that happens in note that there is a portable function called in c and that does also do that job for an enter in but that cause a harm it is not used to terminate the after a key is control continues and then after main the program and recent c versions insert a implicitly after the last statement of the main function stands for this means your main function returns a value of back to the but you can return other values if you write the return explicitly and put another value that value is what it terminates your and returns the given value back to the some other stuff never program will return a value of 42 to the normally you just there and it has the same effect not if you have local the destructor of those are not called if you use but they are cleanly destructed and destructors are called when you use prefer in main when you exit called in other functions than your main will terminate your program so it can be required to use that because return there will just return from those specific functions and do not at all terminate the

general you need to think about variable calling your iterators and is going to confuse you at some if you look it already if and are meaningful how about and think through what the merge sort is those last two blocks are there just to whichever iterator has some stuff so they need to be in the first probably write it as not and if else if else if in somewhat rusty fiter siter siter if else if else if else

good next step might be to go the iphone developer route as you most likely have the experience dealing with client curiosities limited the touch also benefits from having a fairly powerful webkit based browser which can run most ajax you can write and can interface with a server side keep things you could run a java stack on an ec2 server or some other vps that can act as the server side portion of your a investment for the developer license and a month for a cheap vps for but the payoff can be high if the wind is blowing in the right direction and a full moon when you launch your and cheap addictive games can bring in a decent amount of money from the long though who knows how long this will hold with serious games being launched on the iphone by major players like

gwt event you are using and you wanted a click event you could use the and register your own the object will need to implement the callback which would give you the row events handling you need to handle other type of events other than click gwt currently have a ready interface for you pretty much left on your own to implement them two ways of doing it that i can think of quick and dirty is probably by exploiting which provides a means for you to inject javascript into your gwt i use much jsni from really hard workarounds which is not worth the effort writing it in pure in my code so i show you an but frankly i recommend this as it reduces maintainability and you wanted a gwt you can create a new class that inherits htmltable or at the call the function with your needed for probably need then need the onbrowserevent function that handles the quick template of how the code should look class extends public public void case mouse over handling code best of learning how to code this is by looking at the gwt source code itself for and getting the feel on how to do it the gwt

have a situation which i think i need the functionality provided by an interface and an abstract am creating models to be used in a each model is contained in a class that implements an imodel interface my design so it can be i also created a unmanaged win32 dll that acts as a bridge between my model classes and the simulation the model classes are called via hence the requirement for an have just received a new requirement that these model classes should be callable via a web service independently of the simulation now these models are rather and the client has requested that they be configured by the client and executed on the i figured this would be possible if i made the model classes inherit from an abstract then created a web service method on the abstractmodel receives a model object from the executes it and populates it with i cant use an abstract class because the models require an interface for the com can i reconcile these two been told that it is possible to have a class implement an interface and have that class derive from an abstract but i cant find any examples of if its what is the if its not what else should i model classes actually call an ancient fortran so the model configuration of the classes does not give away too much information about how the model can i have a class that implements an interface and inherits from an abstract

have an interesting problem which been looking into and would appreciate some trying to create a tool which mimics the basic capabilities of a requirements management tool as part of a company basic design is a windows setting of folders and documents can be opened in a and document itself contains a hierarchical spreadsheet of excel with if that makes any each chapter contains which are really just some requirements text some other values which complement when the requirement text and attribute values show up as independent columns like with filtering the for this type of program is pretty but where i get hung up on is the document content biggest concern is size and how it relates to as part of this i not only intended to store the current state of each but also the entire list of changes that have been made since day 1 like and then provide fast access to the history of i expect documents in the each document will probably have active over the course of a not unreasonable to assume edits each document itself will acquire an additional rows and by the number of that amounts to nearly rows an additional the next and the next and so old histories can be but it would only be performed by an admin not preferable that do i see there are two ways for me to handle this can try to represent a list all rows of all documents in a single table like how phpbb stores all posts of all forums in a single can try to store the rows of each document in a uniquely named table each document has own the table would have to be given a unique and a master table would contain the list of all documents and the table names that correspond to my which really is are neither really good can anyone offer advice on which approach you would find more given the sql tables on the fly as new content is uploaded a bad

have an server which keeps track on a number of if the birthday is known it is stored as a datetime attribute called now i would like to have another attribute which keeps track of the current age of the since age can change any day i figured a script might be the best thing i was to create a stored procedure which computes the age given the birthday as here is what i came up procedure int when then 1 else 0 i created another script which runs through all records that have a non null dayofbirth attribute and updates the age filled cursorquery cursor for select clientid from clients where dayofbirth is not next from cursorquery into set dayofbirth from kunden where exec update clients set age where clientid fetch next from cursorquery into would trigger the script above once per day to populate the age thats what i have so but i have the feeling there is plenty of room for thanks sung meister ended up with something like table client int primary datetime as when dob is null then else case when and or then 1 else 0 to properly populate the age

have assembly a that depends on type t a in assembly do not own assembly a but i do own assembly t unfortunately is a real type an but luckily a uses reflection to discover its want to be able to create dynamically b the only important item is that i need to be sure that the and dynamically created their are tho those that were statically compiled when a was can use reflection emit to create b and no can write to disk a was compiled against this then i can dynamically change no problem if a was compiled against a equivalent written b and then the in a would have the same assembly name and type name but it would not be considered equal to the one dynamically assume that the reason is the guid property on the when i write to disk the t type has the same guid than the one i can create dynamically if i change its however the type does not share the same summary the guid is the same if the dll comes from the dynamically created but is different from the one statically the guid is the same every time if i the guid is the same if i change the content of the dynamic does the runtime determine if two types are the how is this guid it uses this guid something is it possible to assign this guid in my dimamic assembly to match the one in assembly this guid be examined statically was not able to see it with reflector or assume assemblies are not does the runtime determine that two types are the	
have been asked recently to produced the mips of instructions per for an algorithm we have the algorithm is exposed by a set of we have exercise the code on a dell axim to benchmark the performance under different question came from our hardware but i am mostly a hl software developer so i am not sure how to respond to the maybe someone with similar background can our algorithm is not real i think we need to quantify it as is it possible to simply quote the total number of assembly 1 is how do you do this how to measure the number of assembly either in general or specifically for 2 be performed on a wm device or via the device emulator provided in 3 be a lot for your for all your i think hit the and as a follow i now have more any suggestion on how to go about measuring i heard some one suggest running our algorithm and comparing it against benchmark to calculate since the algorithm does not need to be run in real is mips really a useful what are other ways to quantity the processing have already measured the runtime performance but it was not a satisfactory i assume mips is a crude estimate and would be on optimization to calculate mips for an algorithm for arm

have multiple issues here so try to address them separately and you can correct me if i have appear to have a service and a user application that cannot execute certain functionality at the same in order to achieve this you have the service stop the execute the special then restart the if this is correct in my you have a design rather than then restarting the application you should be coordinating access to the shared resource through mutual exclusion using a named mutex using an ipc method such as named pipes to communicate a user token always only valid in the process that called the token handle you received is an index into the handle table of the it is not directly you would need to use duplicatehandle which may be what you want but could be wish to find the best way to get the token to launch the application into the if this is the the best way is to retrieve the session token and use you can check out and the sample in but should be relatively easy to transfer to your language of updated to include windows since you are running the service under the system account it can open a handle to the process itself necessary the process can send its process it can then open the token attached to that duplicate it and use the resultant token to launch the target

i would like to access the list definition view page which i think will be accessible using the above any other options you think we can use to achieve i have tried the following the oob and place it in the same folder as the custom web part which shows the items of the view with your custom a feature to provision the along with your custom web a custom list in the file of the definition for all the views mention the to refer your with this step all the views mentioned in the list definition will use the to create the view pages and as well all the views which you create after the creation of the list will use the as the base page to create the view copy the oob and place it in the server folder as the custom web part which shows the items of the view with your custom basically use the method to get the view and then retrieve the items in the web the code snippet for the custom web part looks like follows list strviewname view listitems getting the list items then do your custom approach of displaying the the web part dll and place it in the a feature to provision the along with your custom web by activating this feature the will be embedded with your custom web the elements manifest file content looks like follows web part for step gives me error for the source file path which i modified by giving the path attribute in the file the base custom view page is available along with the web now how to integrate the custom view page with the list create a custom list definition and for all the views defined in the schema mention the to use the now the custom view page will be used as the base view page for all the views defined in the list definition and as well the views created later also will be using the as the base the sample snippet for declaring the views inside the is as follows and activate the feature of your custom list with all these when you create a list based on this custom list definition then all the views created will be using the to create the view pages and your custom web part will be rendered instead of the oob the views which you will be creating after the creation of the list through object will also use the as the base page to create view some reason i am still unable to see the with my custom am i missing somthing or there is something missing in this

if you ensure that they render the page in mode as opposed to mode many of the common ie css issues are to do this you must provide a valid doctype statement at the top of the such as html public xhtml others have pointed another good idea is to start off your stylesheet with a snippet that removes all paddings and margins like one common problem with css based layouts in ie is that clearing of floats happen when this is to do with a hidden object property in ie called only objects that will correctly wrap around and enclose floated child it is easy to ensure that your containers simply by specifying at least one dimension for do not personally use conditional ie stylesheets except for one single to replace png backgrounds with gifs in ie 7 there is nothing wrong with using i just find it unnescessarily complicates things when you have to define the appearance of the same object in two different with the three tips above and a bit of patience you should be able to create css based layouts using a single stylesheet that render just as well in ie as they do in

intel platform the explanation is the when you declare on stack the compiler really allocates 8 bytes because of then typical for functions to have the following saves ebp registry value on then moves esp register value into ebp for using esp value to access the this leads to 4 more bytes on stack to be occupied with ebp the epilogue ebp is but its value is usually only used for accessing function so overwriting it may not hurt in most you have the following layout grows downwards on 8 bytes for your then 4 bytes for then usually the return is why you need to overwrite at least 13 bytes to crash your

is basically a so that should be the basis for the general are some thoughts on fifo buffer of you should have an instance of a queue fifo for each instance of your one thread would receive the data and fill while the other one would read the data in a this only means you would have to use a lock on each queue would enable you to simultaneously process the data in the worker while filling it from the communication if you need to receive lots of you could dequeue data in the worker thread and parse it before all of it has been otherwise you would need to wait until all data has been received to parse it all at in most you know how much data you are supposed to until you start to parse worker thread waiting for would create a worker thread which would wait for a signal that new data has been you could use to have a timeout in case nothing happens for a when the data is you would have to parse based on your current state so that would be an implementation of a port handle different types of you could wrap your serial port inside an which could have at least these methods might have forgotten interface void void event void would help you separate the specific communication code from the state to datareceived event is not guaranteed to be raised for every byte use the bytestoread property to determine how much data is left to be read in the so you could create your own implementation of iport which would poll serialport in regular intervals to ensure that you miss a byte is a question of so which already addresses receiving receive the you would have to attach a handler for the event if not wrapping and enqueue the received data to the queue inside the in that handler you would also set the mentionel to notify the worker thread that new data has been

is not an iterator like in and itself is actually a really simple concept once you understand how blocks work in blocks are a functional programming even though ruby is not properly a functional in ruby uses the method to create block which is borrowed from syntax for creating anonymous functions which is what blocks from a computer science blocks lambda are in methods usually take only one can pass but keyword in ruby is just a way of calling a block been given to a these two examples are output yield calling our block here with puts value is the tells ruby to convert an object without calling output explicitly calling the block puts value is the first just assuming a block and say to call in the ruby wraps the block in an object and passes it as an the first is more efficient and but effectively the call either one like a a it would print the value that wound up getting assigned to so a completely stupid but i think you get the are used for a lot of things in almost every place use a loop in a language like replaced in ruby with methods that take for print prints returns value 2 returns andrew also commonly used for opening files and many other basically anytime you have a standard function that could use some custom logic sorting an array or processing a use a there are other uses but this answer is already so long afraid it will cause heart attacks in readers with weaker hopefully this clears up the confusion on this

is not really correct to ask why python is slower than how fast is naive interpreters are around ten times slower than optimised i believe there is a java bytcode interpreter written in javascript that probably very the intended question appears to be is the cpython language system slower than the equivalent ibm and oracle jre and microsoft believe the correct answer is the fastest java and runtime are faster because they have large full time technical teams developing them in language systems are easy to any idiot can do i static language systems are more complex to design and a simple static system will tend to run much faster than the equivalent dynamic it is possible for highly optimised dynamic systems to run almost as i understand some smalltalk implementation were quite an often quoted example of a developed dynamic system is the lisp addition if the real grunt is being done by library then the language system may not the language may encourage give to develop more efficient algorithms which can easily wipe out constant factor performance hawtin

justification is you implement validation on the server side of things as otherwise abusing your code will be very easy by just disabling making it to submit any data without javascript will not solve personal experience i think most internet users hava js enabled the portion of users who may have problems with site is so unless you need to reach it probably should not be a big easiest way to determine js with just a single redirect would be to set a cookie with javascript code and then use the aforementioned to after that the server should be able to read the cookie set by assuming while quite difficult to share validation rules and other logic automatically on both server and the client using tech like i would suggest checking out aptana jaxer is a javascript based framework amongst other will allow you to share the very same javascript code on both client and very nice if you want to validate on the but want to write your validation rules

keep it to the latest version had speed optimizations as sure everyone is using the same version of tortoisesvn which is built against the exact version of the we had many problems with guys updating on whim and then getting weird work between repositories and folders on the same so you move the binaries to another altogether and just link to them with the folders so that you can sparse checkout the project and still be able to work basically everyone checks out tops folder children only then selectively to the folders they need to checkout scripts that build then commit prompt to i have such scripts for my before i run the script and it exports my wc and then this will copy the full so this is useful with sparse checkouts where the data size is moving the binaries off of the repo recommend but it might be the sanest solution to get productivity up exporting create a which means you save disk space compared to so if you restructure such that binaries and infrequently updated items may be exported instead of it would encourage more people to the full and not try to skim some of

key to understanding this sort of problem is that you get an extra item in the not too important what that item the first thing want to do when your container variable has more in it than you expect is to look at the module comes with perl and can pretty print data structures for you see what is in your you can start to work backward to find out how it got in eventually end up noticing that right after you initialized that it already had one which what you trick is to check the number of elements in the are elements in you get a number you work backward to find out when the extra element showed d

keyword in c actually serves two functions depending on where those functions are visibility and duration are my terms based on quite a bit of the if interested in that level of uses different terms which i often find confuses new hence my reticence in using used at file it marks an item or as so that a linker cannot see this is static as in duration is the same as the program until the program this is useful for encapsulating the item within a single compilation unit source in its simplest the item is available to the whole compilation unit declared before used within a it controls duration is limited to within the in this the item is also created once and endures until the program variables within a function are created and destroyed on function entry and gather what after is the first basically a global variable since i immediately see much of a use for the other variant in be done in must belong to a the workaround is to create a class holding the and that object around so you can reference its a singleton item so you can access its

kind of depends on how you want to set things definitely the portion of the manual on processes is worth reading the code for package is a good place to listed a pretty limited set of functionality like to which could be solved by a direct you can find helpful utility functions by looking at what is provided in the application trying to connect to has an interpreted connect to as opposed to writing a custom parser on the app emacs from launching emacs from the app opposed to the other way might have made this job this is what probably little perl script to open a socket and to up loop in the interpreter write a custom and connect it to a emacs with function call or specifying the the perl script as a subprocess and the port how or do that anything from emacs could be sent to the perl subprocess and be passed on to your and have the desired effect you can send commands back to emacs by just sending over and have them parsed by functions stuck in then write two little one in your app interpreted and one in to do whatever functionality makes the emacs library should probably be packaged as a major mode depending on what the files are if solely to be used with the a major if a minor mode would be better given that probably want to leverage the write the little perl script in as opposed to simply i know how to interact with if the little perl script could be replaced with a chunk of and still have the benefit using be an added got pretty much the same setup for only the connection stuff is handled by send it works really app from if you launch the app from the above still only you can get rid of the little perl script and just interact through the no sockets still need the loop the app leave tied to the libraries would remain the be much but only works if the user flow enables you to go that a hunch writing this for more than just your being it might be easier to this way from you could add on the socket communication later as an whichever is more

kinda agree with david on regex matches should not be used as an exclusive criterion to decide if the passed date in the usual procedure in javascript validation involves a few steps the first step is to ensure that the passed string matches date formats by matching it against a the following may be a stricter regex assuming that the only allowed separator is a forward expected the second step is to parse the string into a date object which returns the of milliseconds since use this number as a parameter for the date since js automatically rolls over the passed date to the nearest valid you still cannot be certain if the date object created matches that which was to determine if this the best way is to split the passed string according to the separator and compare individual date d is the created date object as explained arrdateparts return return

law of do second do it unless you actually have measured and know for a fact that you need to optimize and if objects are really expensive to and if they can actually be reused can reset the state with only public operations to something that can be it can be two gains you mention are not really memory allocation in java is cost was close to 10 cpu which is so reducing the creation of objects only saves you the time spent in the this can be a gain with really heavy objects that can be reused without you reuse the the same time is not in fact it can be with moving generational gcs or was up to the cost of a gc run is determined by the number of alive not by the released alive objects will be moved to another space in memory is what makes memory allocation so free memory is contiguous inside each gc a couple of times before being marked as and moved into the older generation memory languages and as were designed keeping in mind the common if you steer away from the common usage in many cases you may end up with harder to read code that is less

lisp applications from command lisp implementations support a or mechanism that will encapsulate a body of code and run functions at as another poster these mechanisms are and lisp implementations have a so a conventional approach to deploying a lisp application is to wrap a shell script around the script must set up the program environment and pass command line typically the runtime context includes application files to load asd or and one or more forms to evaluate or functions to extending can roll your own or you can some existing take a look at which is useful for several below for more about clbuild functionality and can extend clbuild to run your own application with command line for to load the system and run the function you would invoke clbuild as run any 1 2 the character escape syntax for this is needed for most command alternative approach is to redirect standard input from a for run any functionality and is most commonly used to install and run open source commonlisp is a bash so it is highly the download facility relies on programs like and default clbuild runs sbcl but it is very easy to configure it to run another lisp such as cl copy to and edit to point to the lisp executable you want to

looks like gae has chosen a subset of jdk as app engine jdk white is very unfortunate as one gets class linkage errors all over the place with most common java libraries that deal with data class loading and although some omissions may be for deprecated or legacy there are others that are my specific concern is with streaming pull parsers which was just added to jdk after a long delay was finalized at about same time as jdk omitting this makes it harder to do scalable xml as i understand is that not only are classes but they can not even be added because of security this is an philosophical question that probably just gae devs could answer for sure why are some apis dropped from standard jdk seemingly thanks for for what worth i really do not see how security would have anything to do with not including aspects are relevant for great many other things i need for and can see why they are so understandable boilerplate just not applicable for this api is just a set of interfaces and abstract for crying out but more it has exactly the same ramifications as including dom and jaxp interfaces which are included it looks like this issue has been brought to attention of google on whitelisting stax hoping that this and similar issues can be resolved behind google app engine excluding standard jdk

many server applications not be your performance problem manifest only under concurrent access and under measuring absolute time a routine executes and trying to improve it is therefore not very there are problems with this method even in measuring absolute routine time relies on the clock the platform is and these are always very you better rely on average time a routine advice profiling to identify routines that execute the most times and take most tool like or to elaborate representative test simulate concurrent put your application under stress and measure throughput and average response this will give you a better idea of how your application is behaving as seen from the outside you could use unit tests to establish some non functional aspects of your i think that the approach given above will give better results during optimization when placing assertions in your unit tests you will have to choose some very approximative time can vary depending on the environment you are using to run your unit you want tests to fail only because some of your colleagues are using inferior is all about finding right things to you already have a functioning so placing performance related assertions and without establishing critical sections of code might lead you to waste a lot of time on optimizing pieces of your	
markusq your definition of allows you to short cut the starts at and ends at starts at and ends at 1 call in the 2 calls in the 1 call in the interval average concurrent calls is then can be calculated and more covers 2 different minute intervals and covers 2 different minute intervals and total covered minutes 4 important fact here why i bothered reply after markusq is that the duration of a call itself enough to calculate how many minute intervals are in my both calls only last 2 need the following the rounded down to the the rounded down to the covered intervals number of minutes difference 1 round the field down to the minute use the number of covered minutes by a single call would need to round the gives rounding down that value for the range looking then divde by the number of minutes in that and you have your only looking for calls that are truely concurrent you use such but still possible had to do something but for your definition of this should do jan case as as case as as as date and as and as will deliberately not include the interval the 60 minute long through to just noticed that your times and dates are stored as need to convert those to datetimes for my code to if a call started at and ended at the interval should not be case statements added to layout

not a dns and do any dns all the responsibility of the browser viewing the page there are several circumstances that can lead to inconsistent urls being served in the which may be interpreted differently by the will always interpret a url beginning the same way an absolute so the destination will always resolve to the same make sure all your urls to your main site begin beginning will be treated as relative urls if the page containing the url is at essentially asking for find this almost certainly the behaviour looking beginning with a leading slash will be treated as absolute on the current for example within google will result in a request to if no leading the browser will treated the url as being relative to the page currently being viewed a url of when viewing a page in the folder would result in a request to think this is where your problems are for consistent i find a good rule of thumb to ensure all urls begin with a leading if you want to ensure all your hyperlinks generated by your asp code are use the tilde asp will replace with the path to the application root it matter where your page is in your site whether using a web site in iis or a virtual directory in iis the url will always resolve to the correct you want to output a url that a property of a server use the resolveurl this

not entirely sure what but as i read asking what he means by is referring to which form much of the theoretical basis for functional it is an abstract notation for other describing and reasoning about von neumann machine is basically what we programs are executed by instructions manipulating and accessing a store that everything is implicitly done through side data is read from some area in processed a and written back to some area in side the cpu would be limited to manipulating whatever garbage data happened to be in its registers when it was powered calculus has no notion of side so a machine based around this principle would not have the distinction between the cpu can and can be accessed everything in such a machine would be based around functional of functions taking one or more and returning a new never modifying existing not sure how that would work in that answer your	
not entirely sure what you are asking for but thought comment on a few things that seen arise in cots versus custom development choices over the is going to take time to properly analyse any cots systems for both from a requirements perspective and a technical how much custom dev could have been done instead of the the cots sales pitch the promises the moon on a plenty of flashy presentations from who will offer to meet any requirement to get the the most dangerous trap to fall into is being promised functionality that in the cots at present but they will add for you more often than not the salesman has said yes to you without even finding out if possible for their product to do for unit tests in the cots and also what development practices they good indicators of a cowboy development lack of tests and documentation are maintainability headaches in the wary if the cots vendor giving much info about technical aspects of their your desired system is fairly simple then your cots choice will also be fairly but if a complex system you would presumably offer it out for rfp for and to do that you are going to have to have a thorough and correct requirements will the time taken to produce requirements for the rfp out weigh a custom dev agile you are going to have to nail those requirements down super tight to make sure the cots system delivers and that will take a lot of time and i would never consider cots source code is available and i have had programmers assess seen and tried a working demo and not just glitzy sales time or personnel to do it i agree with if a core business function do it no matter

noticed a few regarding stress testing but more interested in knowing a good way to establish a bench mark of what my physical web server can working on a production system right now that seems to be slowing to a near halt on a daily and no one can seem to figure out what is causing the this is your standard set up web db i have created some simple pages that can do a few simple things that using to establish a benchmark for stress testing that i can later user when comparing with the production system that is already in have already built a sample aspx page that simply returns back some web server statistics about the box nothing maybe a few lines of also created a simple web service that will test a db connection given the correct again nothing heavy just opening a db connection and a sample query that really do i would like to know is a good stress level that the following tests should operate in using web application stress and curious what most people would expect the and the ranges should i already know at what point the web server starts its around 20 stress level and 10 stress multiplier give or which results in about page requests trying to find out if that number is way too and if some sort of indication that an issue between the client and the web server or a hardware issue of some or if more of an indication that nothing wrong and that the system is just too since i originally wrote this post the code has been moved to a server running windows 2003 utilizing iis like to know now is if i set up a relatively simple such as a basic file that just serves up a small what would you expect the page requests sec i could achieve from a stress is a good benchmark test for load testing a production system running

number of features were introduced into which made me such as object extension methods and implicitly typed now in with things like the dynamic keyword getting even more know that each of these features be used in appropriate ways in my view they make it easier for developers to make bad coding decisions and therefore write worse it seems to me that microsoft are trying to win market share by making the coding easy and personally i prefer a language that is rigorous and places more demands on my coding standards and forces me to structure things in an oop are a few examples of my concerns for the features mentioned constructors can do important logic that is not exposed to the this is in the control of the object object initializers take this control away and allow the consumer to make the decisions about which fields to i had not appreciated that you can mix constructor and initializer but this starts to look messy to my mind and so i am still not convinced it is a step developers to extend types using extension methods allows all and sundry to start adding their favourite pet methods to the string which can end up with a bewildering array of or requires more policing of coding standards to weed these implicitly typed variables allows quick and dirty programming instead or properly oop which can quickly become an unmanageable mess of vars all over your my worries do you deal with new features of so that they lead to poorly written

over of text and csv files that i need to process i tried using sql server but loading the even with bulk import takes a very long and ideally i need to have the entire data set in to reduce hard disk are over but even when i attempt to filter the information to just one column my console application is consuming of memory to process just 125mb actually of seems that the references to the strings and string arrays are not being collected by the even after setting all references to null and encapsulating idisposables with the using think the culprit is the method which is creating a new string for each comma separated may suggest that i even read the columns into a string but that misses the how can i place this data set in so i can process it in parallel in could optimize the statistical algorithms and coordinate tasks with a sophisticated scheduling but this is something i was hoping to do before i ran into memory and not because have included a full console application that simulates my environment and should help replicate the help is thanks in class static void test uncomment files would be more large object memory allocation problem class public static int allitems new int filecount long totalreadsize for i i out totalreadsize file of read totalreadsize return a csv file and returns the values for a selected private static int out long string fileinfo file new filesize using fs using sr new filein linedelimiter alllines processedcolumn new string for i i current for i i linedelimiter for i i alllines current return a row value from the selected comma separated string and column private static string int entirerow string currentcolumn for i i entirerow return public static void int directoryinfo dirinfo new if random seed new columns new stringbuilder sb new for i i int rows for j j using tw new file of private static string stringbuilder sb new int characters for i i return private static string int stringbuilder sb new for i i columnstogenerate return other columns will be needed and accessed both sequentially and randomly through the life of the so reading from disk each time is a tremendously taxing 4gb of ddr2 sdram core 2 duo runtime vista i leverage 4gb of ram in my computer to process less than 2gb of information in

patterns contribute or detract from the usability of a cli an example consider the cli for the cli is very comprehensive but it is has several glaring i wanted to force the files to lower case into clearcase using unfortunately i wound up on the documentation for its cousin it may seem slight but it cost me more hours than i care to the variation in the middle got provide such nearly identical functionality with such nearly identical there are many better options in my would be better than what they went the code i am working on a cli and this experience made me look at my own i think i have all the basics covered vs short meaningful providing eliminate accurately handling spaces within there is some on this perhaps a bad cli is no different than a cli are type of an api in some the goals are naturally and several factors differentiate cli from a typical one is that cli needs to support scriptability many times perhaps in a series of another is that autocompletion and namespaces exist in the same you always have a nice colorful gui doing stuff for clis must document themselves externally to customer and finally the audience of a cli is vastly different than the standard i appreciate any insight you may for

pretty much tried every python web framework that and it took me a long time to realize there a silver bullet each had its own advantages and i started out with and heartily enjoyed being able to control almost everything at a lower level without much but then i discovered and i have been using it ever tools like catwalk and the web console are invaluable to with turbogears 2 coming out which brings wsgi and after reading up on the religious debates between the django and wsgi really torn between it the right learning spending valuable time writing functionality that already exists in django and other as opposed to using django or some framework that does everything for the downsides with the latter that i can see are pretty not learning anything in the i ever need to do anything lower level going to be a overhead required for just a basic site which uses authentication is i guess my question which is the better or is it just a matter of and should i suck it up and use django if it achieves what i want with minimal fuss want authentication and a crud interface to my i tried and but authkit and repoze scared me as well as the number of steps involved to just setup basic i looked at but the documentation seems and when referencing simple features like authentication or a crud various wiki pages and documentation seemed to contradict each with different hacks for versions and to lott for pointing out that i clear my question which of the following is worthwhile in the long but not painful in the short some sort of middle learn or stick with a if the i would appreciate a suggestion as to whether i should give django another stick with turbogears or venture into some other i have tried but seem to find a good enough crud application that i could plop in and use right vs other python web

reason is that floating point numbers are not a real representation of the number that you save in the to bcd coded can see the definition point the problem is that certain numbers are not expressable with a given set of could if you could add bits trick is that in most cases the difference between the saved number and the intended number are pretty in you have some corner cases where this may lead to is for example the reason why you should not build a financial software and use floating point numbers for money you can easily have differences that are which your tax office to compare floating point numbers you should always apply some kind of threshhold that is ok for your something as david mentioned in his you will still get into trouble with things like you can at least store numbers without loss in precision that you put into the as computers have limited memory you can always construct corner cases where you rely on exact saw your edit of the so here is the next somehow because you know whether just the number representation that is wrong or if just a real value that is close to it really depends on the requirements for your if a small error is then not then you have to use another variable type that is not suffering from the

research was on api documentation rather than protocol but i can recommend two things to take into many people will never read the docs for a and will assume they understand it based on its especially if it is whoever will read will and will lose interest if anything early on seems too here are a few clearly mark the directives things that are very critical for the client to any trick in the book is use lots of exclamation text like note and so even all anything you can do to convey the really critical things is about organization and assume skimming rather than careful place the important directives make sure to state your sentences with directive explanation for x because bla bla rather than bla bla bla therefore do

right way to do this with arrays is to do it with a for a complicated set of arrays play nice with arrays have a different covariance model than generic objects which ultimately causes the problems you are running for with but not with generic you can legally do myarray new you cannot do mycollection new you want more you can see the in java page from the excellent simonn you can also just use your arrays as they and use to silence the this will but without the type safety that generics can provide if performance that you are worried just use an so you are just using a thin wrapper around an but with all of the type safety guarantees provided by

spent the last 4 weeks reading the available material on mvc and doing the various videos and today i started working on an actual application a client awaiting to see results some time i agree with the previous answers awful lot to many many new little in lieu of 3rd party still i am glad i have spent the time learning you have to overcome your fear of row which are hidden with it takes time to get used to the html once you do you will find out about the possibilities you will unlikely miss if you have no experience using unit then i think that mvc provides for a great introduction into the possibilities that come with unit oo is much more present and within separation of concerns is possible and you will not miss mixing gui and business logic in an no more the n different if you never quite liked you will love i am happy not to have to do it ever it is at the beginning it is very things that take little time in can take a lot of time with not having pages any longer is also a massive but once you this you will not miss the an mappers is also one more thing to there is a lot to learn and get used should you be interested in getting the most out of the mvc is only without unit unit testing without a mocking framework is not really so you must learn that by the time you think you are through with unit you see the need to automate parts of your nant must be learned as it is just but once you start using these technologies you will wonder how you ever managed

standard library often has a similar feature set compared to the native library but there are several important is object whether you like it or the advantage of this is that certain concepts are easier to for most file related operations are found directly in the file compare this to where a file is a handle which is really just a an index into your open file the posix approach is very close to how the os actually implements but in java you see that or know it or has certain behaviours in certain there are many awt apis that are the way they are because awt needed to be identical on a number of separate that turned out to be and sun most of because supporting platform equally meant supporting every platform the newer implements almost everything in pure and thus is far better at and thus has a richer and that api is very different from the native windowing swing integrate too well because it uses so little of the native has certain limitations that the native libraries for you have function thus you have and and other java patterns for doing things that in would involve function so any api that needs one of these features will be significantly different in java than in the native in java often has libraries that offer similar behaviour to the native and sometimes offer completely different but best to think of java as a platform in its own sometimes you need advanced such as opengl or data in which case want a specific java api but most of the time you should evaluate java as its own

the compiler translate a call to to be the same as copying and pasting the difference could be profound or simply but what doing is assigning the value from to whether the type is a value type or a reference type will determine exactly what happens and what will happen if you manipulate that but not creating a function pointer or delegate in doing it will have an effect on performance really something that can be answered other than to say that it have a negative we say if it will have a positive since that would depend on what actually happens when you call if an expensive then this could make it but the downside would be that any differences in value upon subsequent calls to be reflected if you cached its value in

the easiest way to get past this is to define a new in the servers window and select or when you do on select manually define a new you can have multiple servers defined using the same tomcat runtime all have separate configs and deployment directories defined by but run them at the same time unless you change the ports listening new server will use a path the tomcat conf and webapps running on this if it you can compare settings with the old try deleting the app from it and and figure out what you might have done to cause the or just delete the original server far as your second not try a new server config get it stop the do a on your delete anything in the and restart the server could remove and add your project to the server again too to be really the console messages too to make sure there were no errors related to

the is textmate 2 still in or has it been is being actively if this text is still that is still the updated april allan stresses that no release is the allan has updated the textmate blog with on the past two posts on this blog have slowed to just a and a number of textmate users have asked about or publicly worried about its this blog the first written here in a long is an attempt to assuage those concerns and answer some of the most frequent textmate development is going textmate 2 done but progress is it is starting to take and the end is in the rewrite has been a slow and careful but the ideas behind it are i hope to publicly describe some new abstractions in the coming weeks and the community continues to churn out new bundles and features for textmate and been building up a backlog of posts describing while i am not writing to announce a release date for textmate i do hope that this post will be the first in a series showing a bit more requests for textmate 1 have mostly been incremental additions such as split chunked and editing over but textmate 2 is about more than new surface every part has been completely rewritten to take advantage of the lessons learned from the years of version not only are the data structures chosen for increased but the abstractions on which textmate is language been rethought and are more powerful than in the coming try to describe some of these new but for know that i am excited about the new ideas where does development stand for it feels to me like most of the modules are getting say but as they on the mountains look while i use for my own and the basic infrastructure is pretty much of the still needs and for now all lacking the spit and polish of a finished hopefully an alpha version will be ready before too but i make any promises about why i been better about keeping the world it is a combination of many things but the main issue is that i am not good at writing for a large i am more into informal for instance over mailing lists or on so while i started a lot of i end up unhappy with them halfway and they get finished or i am taking i have enlisted a technical writer to help bring this blog back to and try to communicate more of status and direction through than either of those problems as i is that textmate 2 is no minor a major undertaking with a long timeline and its final form fully i want to hype and i want to get hopes up before i know i can meet their i wanted to throw ideas onto the internet without having a chance to implement them humbled that textmate has served as inspiration for many other and i hope that it continues to be a model for other developers in the but i want to see my ideas done my way before i feed them to the am trying to slowly turn this with this i hopefully am showing that a hand is at the i know been quiet too long about my i make up for but going i aim to do the official blog saying the public alpha version will be release before christmas

the most applications with a safe type system just or allow the application to violate those overflows and many other exploits occur because the constraints in those languages and runtimes provide no checking and cannot guarantee the program do something like execute arbitrary code in safe systems verify the code to be free from those a side can still perform unsafe actions and set itself up to execute arbitrary just rather cumbersome and unlikely to be used in a real security holes you would see in a managed browser would be if it let arbitrary code be using the clr as a safe while the clr generated code the of your will be the loader and verifier themselves are usually written in a lower been a few think 2 for security holes where a maliciously formed assembly could force the actual clr to execute arbitrary these are relatively rare and the surface area is far less than be a fully managed browser itself fall prey to those specific but that also means have to have your plugins written and executed in a similar way there are other security holes that can be but usually they will be less severe than find with an unmanaged for would still remain an but at least you have a document can execute arbitary type	
the most practical way to add custom properties to a side wide assume a simple actionresult return first thing that comes to mind is a custom class and using in a application base class customdatadictionary public string title class applicationcontroller public new customdatadictionary viewdata assuming you would also have to also make a corresponding customviewpage with the same property to use the custom view data dictionary in the views as second thing that comes to mind is to create a viewdatadictionaryextensions use a my beef with view models are that always creating one and passing it into view seems like repeating yourself over and over in controller at least compared to the previous two real goal is that each application might have a core set of properties in the viewdata that make sense for that apps i tend to shy away from relying on dictionary and it would be nice to have real properties for other developers to rely one to know what data to keys can easily be three methods get the job what have others way to	
the mouse moves over your something similar to the following mouse leaves the usercontrol though it is still inside the and enters the event handler making the picturebox not the picturebox the mouse leaves the picturebox and enters the event handler making the picturebox the picturebox is now the process starts over from the i tested your the flickered continuously it kept having its visibility and was unable to stay visible long enough to register any way to address this is to modify your handler to be something like sub sender as byval e as handles if not checks to make sure that the mouse has actually left the control before making the button the size of the picturebox may have broken the cycle outlined but it address the fundamental are some other things have nothing to do with your to think that recommended that you just override the etc methods in your instead of subscribing to the corresponding that handling controls this way can make it impossible for someone to use your application with a keyboard the user to your button and press

the nsstring nsstring therequest difference is that one of these lets you get away with releasing something you own and the other alloc copy or retain so you own so release an implementation string literals implement string literal objects will ignore you when you try to retain or release why the version where you release a string literal and the version where you create a new string and release that but this is an implementation rely on it for always assume that releasing something you own will cause a there a way to accurately check if receiveddata has the actual data you are opposed to an error check the response opposed to some other you could use although how you determine the correct hash to expect would be up to probably easier to just have faith that the server give you the wrong resource i requested there but does anything indicate implement and check the response that if the server is using or something it may correct your url instead of returning an by changing the that you requested to the that actually doing this in my app the only protocol there is how do all of the nsurlconnection methods work if there a delegate for said so the the at nsurlconnection categories the methods onto so always at least in you override these so when nsurlconnection sends your connection delegate those they go through to the implementations you

think a good idea to ask how much longer the expect to be using the if the lifespan is limited three years or then it may not make sense to put much effort into if the lifespan is expected to be then the payback for refactoring becomes that much more might also want to try creating a business case for the investment in show specific examples of the kinds of improvements that you would want to make an honest assessment of the and expected try to find a specific refactoring that you could implement independently of the and lobby for approval to make that change as a test run of the refactoring when you talk about you may be expected to provide specific not enough to say will be much easier to fix you should be prepared to say something like see a minimum improvement in turnaround time for bug or will experience fewer you should also be prepared to negotiate with management customers so that you all agree that you have measurements that are meaningful to and to provide measurements from before and after the

think is absolutely spot however like to add the following a meaningful error message is useful for logging and exception an exception thrown by the bcl is less likely to describe the specific circumstances of the exception wrt your perhaps this is less of an issue with null checks which of the necessarily give you much information was passed a null no idea is pretty much the best you can do most of the however sometimes you can provide more information and obviously this is more likely to be relevant when dealing with other exception null check clearly demonstrates to other developers and a form of you come back to the code a year that possible someone might pass a and it would be problematic if they did on excellent point you might do something before the null gets picked up i think it is vitally important to engage in checking for an exception before running other code is a form of defensive programming as you are taking into account things might not work the way you expected changes might be made in the future that you and ensuring that no matter what happens your null check such problems cannot a form of runtime that your parameter is not you can proceed on the assumption that it above assumption can result in slimmer you write the rest of your code knowing the parameter is not cutting down on extraneous subsequent null

think the number 1 reason from a management standpoint is for perceived if you work on more than one project at the same time stakeholders are able to see progress if you hold one project off then the stakeholders of that project may not like that nothing is being worked on more than 1 project also minimizes risks for example if you work on one project first and that project takes longer than expected you could run into issues with the second stakeholder also most likely want their project done holding one off due to another project can make them reconsider going ahead with the on what the projects are you might be able to leverage work done in one for the if they are similar then doing both at the same time could be of if you do them in sequence only the subsequent projects can benefit from the previous often projects are not a constant stream of sometimes developers are busy and sometimes if you only work on 1 project at a time a developer and other team members would likely be doing nothing while the more tasks are taking managing the time over more than one project allows teams to get more done in a shorter a developer i prefer working on multiple projects as long as the timelines are as long as not being asked to do both at the same time with no change in the schedule i am often if stuck on one project i can work on the it depends on the projects

think there are two related issues one is the question of code which many of the other responders have commented on in if you can easily reuse the you second question is whether it is sensible to have two applications with substantially different behaviors share a common user this is the more interesting question i the answer depends on what your applications are used for the various applications in an office suite often share a substantial amount of the user interface they have common generally considered as it makes it easy for a user familiar with one application to work with another from the same the other you can imagine cases where sharing the ui will only lead to frustration and agony for your as an extreme suppose you have an smarthouse which allows you to control various aspects of your ultra modern smart in this you have a control that allows you to turn off the cooling system in the this involves a button with a clever icon of a melting ice cube or when you click the a dialog is shown asking the user to confirm the suppose you need to write nuclearpowerplant thinking to save some development you crib the ui from smarthouse lots of things line up just even a need for a button to turn off the cooling system in this new so you reuse the ui from the first your users have all been using smarthouse 2009 for months and and they have gotten very used to turning off the home with that ingrained into them that using that button is a relatively harmless one some poor user comes to the office and logs into nuclearpowerplant he feels a little bit so he clicks on the melting ice cube expecting it to turn off the he even clicks through the next dialog been doing this for months at too bad for he disables the power plant cooling triggering a massive nuclear this is an extreme fictional but you could easily imagine situations in ordinary where a user gets used to a button in app a doing a particular kind of and assumes that a similar button in app b will do a similar kind of if it your users will curse you every time they hit that the question how similar are your applications are the conceptually the but operating on different types of or data from different are they related in that they are part of a suite of tools with many common actions between the or are they really unrelated if they are what is the probability that a user of app a will ever need to use app

think you are being too what some people do with session objects is not always a good but there is nothing inherently wrong with the is a good use of session objects in the right for caching user specific data that is stored in the db and frequently change except by the actions of that this incurs a memory penalty on the web server as a for fewer hits on the db i am happy to make this because it is far simpler and cheaper to scale to multiple web servers than multiple sql general rule of thumb is to use sessions only for caching that if the code easily reload itself after a session expires without intervention from the i go

to work with angles will get a bit more complicated than you need to for this kind of animation you generally want to use floats to store your objects x and y coordinates and move it by applying x and y deltas floats will preserve the detail of the position which is lost to rounding when drawn on the the deltas represent the speed your object is moving in each axis and can be negative or each iteration of your add xdelta to your x coordinate and add ydelta to your y round them off to position them on the you hit the top or bottom you would swap the sign on your ydelta component and likewise for side want to keep the same x and y delta all the time so when the objects hits a modify the x or y delta a little bit to change up the

true json is much stricter than and to be valid you have to have your keys 3 as you are using a bare which generally expects to receive an xml result unless mime headers specify strictly may however wish to make your own life easier by simply using a javascript framework such as jquery which will abstract away all this problem for you and deal with all the nasty edge data do stuff here if you use both strict json and use a library to abstract it for when browsers start having native json parsers the library will be able to transparently make use of these and get a significant speed this is slated to happen sooner than and when it your users will get a silent upgrade with no effort

two databases is very complicated if both databases need to be if one is a slave of the not nearly as i have more than once programmed just this kind of synchronization using once with an mdb on a web server that had to be synched with a local data mdb incorporate data edited on the no edits went back to the so but still the need to merge edits on the as well as once programming a synch between mysql on a website and access in a master slave the you program a dump of data for each table to a text helpful to have timestamp fields in the mysql tables so that you know when records were created and this allows you to select which records to dump since the last data dump makes the synchronization of data on the access side much way i programmed it was to then import the text files into staging tables that were indexed appropriately and linked to the access once the data dumps are imported into the staging you then have three the new records and append them to the access data this is easily done with an outer with the discuss this as with updated for i wrote dao code that would write sql like the where clause has to be a bit more complicated than that have to deal with and you have to use criteria formatted appropriately for the data with and for text and and no delimiters for numeric but writing the code to do that is pretty code looks something like dim db as dim rsfields as dim fld as dim strsql as set rsfields top 1 field3 from for each fld in your sql statement and execute next set fld set rsfields set db as i the complicated part is writing the where clause for each sql but pretty easy to figure note that in your rsfields recordset is used only to walk through the fields you want to you want to include only the fields that are so leave out the created field and the pk field any other fields that you want to for the might think a good idea to simply delete any record in the local table not in the remote that works fine if it really is a slave but so often what is originally a slave ends up getting its own in that you need to delete records from the master mysql and instead have a delete flag that marks records you could have different varieties of logic that could clean the deleted records out of the master database if using date stamps in the you could delete all records flagged deleted with lastupdated timestamp that is the last time you dumped the you could have the access app send a text file up to the server with a list of the records that have been successfully deleted from the access data if there are edits in the access data then need some logic for dealing with an edit there on a record that was deleted from the mysql you have a true fairly if you really wanted to do it by brute just dump the entirety of all the mysql data tables to text delete all the records in your access data store and import the text would tend not to do as the first time you need to depart from the pure hosed and have to rewrite everything from outline i gave above will work very cleanly for but will also work well if you have a few fields that are private to the or data that exists in the slave and not in the master is the situation i was working

want to do this between the channel or and your my preferred practice is to isolate file from structures by write code that builds the file buffers in a known and matching read code that reverses that specific example is particularly difficult to guess at because the bitfields are defined to be unsigned int and is particularly as a swag that then getting a pointer to the struct and reording the individual bytes probably gets you the answer you trick of defining the struct differently for different platforms but in the example you cite there a clean break at byte so it is not likely to be possible to produce an equivalent of one platform in the other without splitting one or more of the fields into two

way selector engine works is by utilizing existing javascript no one has created something like this in haskell to my and probably with good easy to do with javascript because of the dom and existing but in you have neither a big need for it nor is it particularly far as writing it just be doing a lot of nasty xml if you can tidy up the page into you can parse it as you can select based on if a node has if a node has a given what the element itself and so just looking for an xml library if this works for recommend only used it twice but liked nothing quite like this

web pun programming one would always take this approach because you depend on the validation actually a crafty user can construct a form post or url that simulates your client and sends data back to the a standalone it is less i would suggest that it depends on where the validation is for if your validation runs in your business not in your then your validation ought to run every using separation of the business logic depend on the ui to do after the business logic may be called from a typical a web or even an thing that i would suggest is that doubling up the validation logic in the is probably overkill but you ought to be able to handle errors arising from the underlying in this the errors might arise from

went through some testing with this as if you are loading a javascript file it is faster to put it at the end but it does come with some important first is that doing this often made some of my visual effects for if i was using jquery to format a the table would come up unformatted and then the code would run to reformat i find this to be a good user experience and would rather the page came up putting it at the end made it hard to put code in your pages because often functions exist if you have this in your that work until the jquery object is if defined at the end of your page the above will produce an you could argue that all that styling code could be put in the external file but that would be a mistake for performance i started off doing that on a project and then found my page took a second to run through all the javascript that had been so i created functions for the relevant behaviour and then called the appropriate ones in each reducing the javascript load run time to you can minimize the load time of javascript by versioning your javascript files and then using expires headers so only loaded once time at which point where they are in the file is largely all in all i found putting putting the javascript files at the end of the file to be cumbersome and ultimately

what you created is not a variable an array whose size is not that array has an incomplete and can thus not be defined in what you can do is to make it just a declaration by putting before coords in the file that initializes you can then create that array beware you should do it at namespace outside any of what you want is an array whose size is not known at compile time but rather at you should use a coords later if you fill create a local array and then initialize the vector using a copy of the elements of that c sizeof c sizeof in it is slightly different than in you define an array whose dimension what happens is that taken to be a if at the end of the file of its translation which is that and all the files it includes meaning everything the compiler translates there is not a subsequent definition of it that includes the then the size is taken to be in there are no tentative and a definition that does not include the size and does not contain an initializer that can tell the size is an invalid the reason why your code goes you are the compiler will read set lhs to lhs is a variable of type rhs what the heck is the compiler has no clue what the right hand side is supposed to for that reason version of introduced compound it allows you to it will actually do what you want it to do creating a right hand side value of type and assigns it to the left hand but you should already from a compatibility reason c compilers are not reasonable c99 compliant and neither nor c89 supports compound use one of the previous ways i showed

word is a little do you mean instance methods that look like answer to all three is but not very the runtime includes functions to get the ivar method list or property list for a class and then a corresponding function for each type to get the name of an item in the list in it can be kind of a lot of work to get it or at least a lot more than most people would want to do for what usually amounts to a really trivial you could just write a script that just reads a header file and looks for whatever consider for the	
work as a physicist in a uk i should emphasise that different areas of research have different emphasis on particle physicists do computational modelling almost exclusively and may collaborate on large software whereas people in fields like my own write code relatively i suspect most scientists fall into the latter i would say coding skills are usually seen as useful in but not much like skills are seen as useful for programmers but not with this in have you used for developing scientific data what what do you use for data analysis and plotting is done using generic data analysis packages such as which can be thought of as these packages typically have a scripting language that can be used to more specialist analysis may have a dedicated utility for the job that generally will have been written a long time has the source for and is pretty some more techie types might use the languages that have been mentioned matlab with gnuplot for software is commonly done in although we actually use delphi which is somewhat there any training for people without any significant background in been to seminars on grid 3d learning boost given by both universities been as an undergraduate we were taught vba for excel and matlab but is more you have anything like version bug although people do have personal development our code base is in a shared folder on a which is kept current with a synching would you go about trying to create a decent environment for without getting too much in the way of the individual scientists physicists are stubborn step at a i am trying to replace the shared folder with something a bit more perhaps finding a svn client which mimics the current synching tools behaviour would say though on the for most natural science time is generally better spent doing	
work we have a very large that we commonly export for a web application to ensure everything is if we develop test code it is always done in a branch in order to make sure not conflicting with the trunk which could unexpectedly cause a bug to get question is whether possible to do an svn export but only for differences otherwise the entire repository has to be exported again which takes quite some say for example we had a then we compare the last update dates against files and only export those that are later than the last export would be quite handy for systems where a full export is done in order to keep our in any looking at the i see how you create a patch for files that already exist in the got already committed so want to create a patch from x revision to the head and apply that to the root of my project in order to apply every single not sure if a diff	
work we have to track our calls via an online application made via to enter the needed info into the text boxes and drop down boxes you have to deal with more than one it is cumbersome to have to type or even copy and paste the needed want to be able to type the info onto one page in excel and then have a script be able to copy and paste into the text boxes located on the browser screen without me having to do the copying and this can anyone point me in the right noticed when you try to create an email account they always have that one box where you have to type the squiggly letters i assume this is because there are apps that can automatically paste or write to a text box located on a browzer help to point me in the right direction would be to create script to copy a cell from excel and paste into a text box located on a

works try we use it with in your updated you asked about using frameworks such as jquery with can you do would you want a more difficult in you let webforms generate javascript for why you have updatepanel and the on one this is because you can focus your coding attention on and you can use grid components which require you to write any javascript at all to make them on the other limited to what the generated code can you can write javascript even in but you have to work around some of the things the framework like changing ids on you can write event handlers in but this requires the use of which do not fit naturally in with consequences that are visible to the is common to use jquery with mvc in no small part because it ships with the but even before that it was still very common to use the two together because jquery makes it very easy to do things which are otherwise not directly supported within like making controls on a page interact with each this means you have to write but as long as ok with you get the huge advantage that you can write any kind of interaction you want to without having to postback to the you are just looking for a good grid control for then i would suggest using a control designed for rather than a grid designed for the reason is that the code you will write will fit more naturally within the idioms of you just want to learn a really good because the framework is and but not sure that a great control is the best place to a better place to start might be adding visual flair to some of your existing it is easier to start with known html and manipulate it with jquery than it is to be generating new html and learning jquery at the same

worry about you have a highly scientific then i think worrying about language is the biggest issue for i think you should concentrate on making your application especially making it scale past a single this will get you far more performance than just switching long as confined to a single going to be starved for compute power and bandwidth for your on upcoming not clear that have the bandwidth you need to do computing on all the you can do computationally intensive work a gpu but you may not be able to feed all the cores if you need to stream a lot of data to every one of think you should consider two problem sounds like a good match for something like which is designed for very has scaled to nodes on and you can shunt your work off either to someone or your own compute written in so as far as porting you can either call your existing c code from within or you can port the whole thing to you want to bother porting to or if for some reason your parallel paradigm fit the mapreduce you could consider adapting your app to use this would also allow you to scale out to of mpi is the standard for computationally and i believe there are java but mostly people use mpi with and so you could keep your code in c and focus on parallelizing the take a look at for starters if you are

would actually argue that the most important thing is to make sure that the terminology you use would be easily most duplicate bugs would come from using nonstandard for the exact i think it really matters that possible to create a horrible ticket in any long as the basic metadata that helps steer it to the right people is there what and everything else is just icing on the cake and the textual narrative is think most programmers are good enough at figuring out what could be report the browser version if i have a problem with a web but not bother to mention how many processors using or what my exact os version mention steps to reproduce if i can distill	
would add a bat to your template that sets the required properties with and afterwards deletes user would export the add the files to a new repository and the run the propset meant a batch you can look what properties you currently have with svn proplist and svn in your you would then call svn propset propset propset	
would also advocate a design where all the languages are stored in a single table with a language sql may be potentially vulnerable to sql if the variable cannot be trusted if the schema and table need to be validated to be a valid you can check it against using a technique like as from as join on is not declare as set exec you have the power and flexibility of dynamic but it is not vulnerable to	
would assume that the debugger needs to wake up for every method call to see if it matches the that were selected to because it has to check every method call for a potential match before it can execute it is considerably slower than if it does not have to do all these	
would avoid doing anything and instead use the queue and the database to synchronize as many worker processes as you care to start this application i think twisted or any framework for creating server applications is going to be it python script starts checks the does some checks the queue if you want a proper background daemon you might want to just make sure you detach from the terminal as described some maybe a block to email out failures to

would consider what everyone else uses not the folks on this but the folks who write the same kind of massively or super find they all write their code in just for this fact alone regardless of any speed issues between the i would go with the tools they use and have developed will be of much more use to you if writing in the same from found apps to have somewhat less than optimal performance in some multithreading is will try to keep you safe from thread problems a good thing in most but this will cause your specific case problems try writing a simple loop that accesses a shared object using lots of run that on a single core pc and you get better performance than if you run it on a multiple core box is adding its own locks to make sure you muck it used the static lock on took on my old on my superfast the lock version is even try it next point is that with c you tend to access memory and data directly nothing gets in the with you will use some of the many classes that are these will be good in the general but after the most efficient way to access this for your case is a big deal with of those classes were not designed with those datasets in they were designed for the common cases everyone else so you would be safer using c for this never get the gc getting clogged up by a class that creates new strings internally when you read a couple of terabytes of data if you write it in it may appear that can give you benefits over a native but i think find those benefits are only realised for the kind of applications that are commonly

would like to learn a language that will teach good programming that sound like you may learn the fundemantals of using a forloop but not the best choice if you want to learn good programming you develop outside a fat ide python is not really a language for not sure about ruby but i think pretty similar in that respect hard to analyze the code staticaly so not much use of ides that try to guess what you are thinking when you push a both ruby and python are great languages if you can make a small shift in your thought process to grasp the that leaves you whith which is a great language and with which you are pretty much stuck on windows i know of a far cry from ms in my opinion is not very well suited for learning the basics of programming not web recommendation is to try and develop something small with any of these and see what you like set yourself a a blogging engine is a bit too much and maybe a service like

would recommend putting your website code under full version control or test and maintain your source in a private sandbox and just check out the latest stable version at the production site whenever ready for database even for small projects i maintain separate development and production you can version the sql used to generate and maintain your schema and testing or bootstrapping data along with the rest of your manage the database environment used by your site from an easily separated configuration and tell your version control solution to ignore urls are going to be a if you avoid you could always store the hostname in the same configuration file and read it as except within stylesheets and javascript of my second choice for that problem would be magic or its equivalent in the development and my last choice would be just messing with the file when i wanted to test features that depend on

would strongly advise against using short just reading your example shows how much more documentation is suddenly when names like fatajtw are at some point it will get pretty much unmaintainable and this just for saving some bytes to the only reason for considering names is to make the resulting script smaller and thus save some i would instead recommend using gzip which will save you way more than a few bytes for an	
would suggest architecture using even another ms messaging in order to talk to your what you are effectively doing is writing a device driver for a specialized piece of by making it you the code into a windows service which can run on any machine your web server can connect not just the local have the server handle multiple so that clients other than your web server can access the hardware and the access contention is handled in a rational think test console for the a cool line to your resume about writing systems and windows some other benefits that i think of now written with you can also abstract the service to handle multiple devices at the same	
would suggest looking at the javadoc for the thread you have multiple mechanisms for thread main thread could the three threads and would then not proceed until all three are the thread state of the spawned threads at all of the spawned threads into a separate threadgroup and poll the on the threadgroup and wait for it to get to a custom callback or listener type of interface for sure there are plenty of other ways still

you are doing a small number of looping is but if the batch processes ever get you will need other alternative to what other suggested if you end up needing the logic is to change the proc to allow either or individual by making the parameters optional gui will need to check to make sure all required parameters are passed for individual and adding a parameter for a batchnumber to be passed in for you can put the logic for both in one batch number is do the current if it is passed go to the batch processing part of the for batch the insert proc can becalled by another proc that generates a new batch inserts the info you want to insert into a work table including the batch then it uses the batchnumebr as the input parameter for the insert still will have to write the logic for both but since they are in the same they will be easier to maintain and you will be less likely to forget to update both

you are still having trouble implementing this functionality using linq to then you may want to solve the problem at the database level using row level essentially you could wrap each table with a view which implements a dynamic requires you to dynamically set each connection properties before a connection is made to the database each database user has a specific sql username and if this not a viable you may want to consider building a framework around the l2s context so that you can inject your own if you would like further havea read

you each different actual template makes an entirely new which has relation inheritance relation with any any other with a diffent actual made from that except that each provides the same so that a you can handle then the neither the static types or the dynamic types have any me drop back and i declare a pointer to has what we call a static of if class bar is a subclass of and i point fp at new new we say that the object pointed to by fp has the dynamic type of bar2 also publicly derives from i can do new without ever even knowing what fp points i can call virtual methods declared in and have the compiler make sure that the method defined in he dynamic type pointed to is a typename t struct baz void and are two different class with no only is that i can call on but since the static types have no if i have a i point it to a not even with a the compiler has no way to a call to the baz dosotheing method into a call to a because is no there is no there are ony and and but no common baz is not a baz is a a set of instructions about how to make a class if and only if we have a t parameter bound to an actual type to a there is one way i can treat those in a they present the same and the if it knows what kind of baz really dealing can make a call to that method a static access of a member a template is not a template is the instructions of how to synthesize a a in a template is not a an instruction of how to write the code to make a that was long winded and outside of a template there is no relationship between a paramvector and so your assignment with partial application of you can write a which gives a of how to transform a to a notice the t and the if you can write code to turn any kind of regardless of actual template parameter into any other kind of you can package that up as a partially applied and the compiler will add that function for probably involves making a and transforming each t in the into a u to put in the which still let you asign to a maybe you want to have both templates and in that you can same that all paramvectors regardless of type inherit from some and then there would be a relationship between all be sibling subclasses of that base

you have a key then the client could encrypt with the public and you decrypt with the private too much work for the and not a very way of doing you are sending the user name and password as parameters then you should resort to transport which requires you to have a key combination issued to you from a trusted certificate should be noted that your association of ssl encrypted channel with an external facing site is the point of wanting to encrypt a channel is to prevent exactly like you are trying to do could use a but that would require installing the public key of the certificate on each machine that is going to call your web easier to just get one from a trusted

you have an answer that is not java sqlite be pleased to read store items in a database with the following scheme item this is the primary if it the id of the item containing this date an ordinary foreign key to a pair of named geocontext this is the primary name way for the user to label a pair of coordinates x one of the y the other must filter the items according to the geocontext and the it would be a easy job if items were all at the same but the trick is 2 is no explicit limit to the recursive if we are in any node and filter with the date of we must see not only the items directly contained in the node that match the but must see the items that contain items matching the date as we are in if matches the then we consider matches the date too and we must keep if we are at the then item 2 must be goes for the but even harder because stored in an other the context is a costly mathematical brute forcing the matching would result in the software to be slow and a very poor user need to display a i display a list of filtered data from a we must see only a flat list of the top the challenge is to decide whether to display each element or according to all the children i tried to solve thought i could ease a bit the problem by using more tables to cache flat data i can join the items table on this i can delete update a and so delete update the i can delete update a and so delete update the x i can brute force y date seems but i tried it it should the following drawbacks moved the costly process to the set create delete methods have to manage the cached will be a troublesome code and a five item will triger a process hit recursively five size ot the data base a five de depth store cached data for know if this a a app with i think insert more thatn 1000 more than 10 level of the good news is we go from bottom of the pyramid to the the other so not horrible as it when i have to deal with parent it will be another but i save it for question my would you store the data and process the filtering int the most optimal way i define an explicit recursive depth limit i perform the filtering using sql or java sql surely will be but matching the geocontext is far easier to do in i am working on the android i have the following constraints is the only language not with the entire standard is the only dbms and memory are in case you have to life and is the external libs may not be be i dug into so and found some interesting pieces of information a but not a problem data processing performance using java and

you just tell the models that there have to be columns in the database for it you set up related rails assumes followed a convention which allows it to find the things you what set up the conventions in you name the table in a predictable way plural in this when you have a relationship to another you have to create that column and name it in another predictable way if relating to the write a model class inheriting from person you instantiate one of these the constructor looks at the name of the converts it to lowercase and pluralizes by reading it yields the name of the table we created now activerecord knows where to get all the information about a and it can read the sql output to figure out what the columns add relationships to the or you type something it assumes a few name of the model that you relate to is bankaccount name of the column in the table which refers to a bank account is singularizing the relationship is activerecord knows to give you methods like using plural names for all of that activerecord knows how to make sql queries that will give you a bank it knows where to find because you followed a naming convention that it understands when you created the table and its of the neat things about ruby is that you can run methods on a whole and those methods can add other methods to a exactly what and friends are

you know what you want you can attack the problem from all good design principles dictate that you have some sort of a spec first which outlines the features you not only does it help you set your feature but this is a remarkably useful exercise in planning out your good design principle dictate that you design domain objects or business objects this is all the in your say you want to develop a website that shows the baseball statistics for major league the domain objects here are the nouns and so for each of these you create a domain model and a corresponding database then you start thinking about the functionality you want to add to each for example or design can also happen in parallel and here too you should use mockups either on paper or using some tools mockups is my some point it just comes down to personal management and avoiding if you are undoing too much something is a source control system will help you realize this
