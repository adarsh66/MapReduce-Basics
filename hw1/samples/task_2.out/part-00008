1992 to 1993 timeframe was pivotal and fateful for the time frame i worked on a plugin architecture for aldus which was coded in pagemaker was built on a oop framework called which assisted its portability between mac os and we tried to use the features of to build a plugin this proved to be very problematic for classes due to the brittle base class proceeded to write a paper that was published in journals and that i presented at oopsla in a reflection you can read the pdf format of the paper i presented invariant virtual member function dispatching for evolvable to the bottom and click or also made contact with bjarne stroustrup at a usenix conference in portland and proceeded to dialog with him for several where he championed the issue of dealing with the brittle base class problem on my other issues were deemed more important at that time for trying to shepard rtti through at this time introduced the system for the windows platform that was looked on as a viable solution to the could be used as an implementation language for com via abstract classes used to define com these days developers shun and especially that was based on 1994 i went on to work at microsoft and used and there for the remainder of the i came to conclude that the technology combination was a definite i refer to that experience effective enterprise distributed software contrast to all this early steve devised a plugin architecture using objective c during the early and that was integral to the next step today that lives on vibrantly in mac os x on computers and important platforms such as the submit objective c enabled solving the plugin problem in a superior champions of java will cite factors such as garbage collection as to why it is more productive than i dispute but objective c has not had garbage collection until very recently with on the iphone garbage collection is still not the os x plugin architecture has been entirely viable due entirely to the merits of objective c style of oop vs java has been used to build the most pervasive plugin architectures that exist for any platform or software development the eclipse ide plugin which by now is practically as such architectures incorporated a few years ago the equinox osgi module management j2ee app servers have supported a for ejbs for a these days all j2ee app servers of note have likewise incorporated osgi to manage runtime bindable the spring framework and its runtime bindable unit of the spring bean has grown to exceed j2ee primarily on the strength of its system for managing the binding in of the spring java community is still struggling to define an official module management standard yet even as things the java platform supports software architectures that incorporate plugin capability more pervasively than any other programming the weaknesses of java as a language relative to and that already has a stronger module implementation in its assembly java is still light years ahead in terms of everyday software systems in wide use that incorporate some form of plugin the java community even consciously realize that this is the underpinning of their continued success as an enterprise development personally regard the brittle base class problem of to be most fatal 17 years have passed since this issue was highlighted to the and to the creator of is it now too late to address 17 years is it too late to fix runtime

5 is almost completely backwards compatible with java the only change you make when you migrate is to rename any usages of the new keyword in the java 4 full list of potential compatibility problems is listed only other one that run into in practice is related to the change in the jaxp in our it simply meant removing from the far as refactoring i think that migrating your collection classes to use the new generic versions and removing unnecessary casting is a good but as another poster pointed changing to generic collections tends to work best if you work in vertical you end up having to add casting to the code to make the generic types compatible with the feature i like to use when migrating code is the it helps to catch inheritance problems when refactoring new concurrency library is very useful if your code uses for you may be able to replace thread pools with a would definitely take the approach of updating the code as you change it during normal other than the compatibility i think there is a compelling reason to use the new java 5 features unless already changing the code for other

a command prompt run netstat on the and look at just the listening there should be one showing the port your server is running on as the number after the colon in the local address local address foreign address the local address is shown as it means your server application is listening only on the loopback this adapter allows only connections from the local machine back to itself the so remote connections to such ports will not be note that the name is a name for so if you have specified that anywhere this could be the in the above example shows a listening loopback the local address is shown as it means your server application is listening on all adapters and you have a network adapter which i will assume you remote connections will be in the above final case if the local address is another ip address then your server application is listening on a particular network if you have multiple adapters it could be it is listening on the wrong having said all i have just a small application with the code you posted and it appears the default is to listen on so i would be surprised if you see something if you do see then my next port of call would be to look at firewalls on both the client and both local and corporate if you are in an you have console access to the remote machine then you could try telneting back to the local machine on that port to see if it indeed listening for i would also be tempted to substitute a simple tcp such as on the server to see if the problem lays with your application or in the

a python there is no only purpose of ssmtp is to wrap the smtp protocol in the sendmail that it provides a program that accepts the same and inputs as the sendmail most of the options do but behind the instead of processing the email it sends the message to an smtp this is for systems that need to have a program perhaps because they understand smtp for i think older versions of php had this and even in recent versions it might still be easier to configure php to use the sendmail interface the program than to use smtp used php in a little not sure about the current in python the situation is you have a builtin library that makes it easy to use smtp whereas using requires you to invoke the module which is somewhat clunky and also very dependent on things that are not part of so basically there is no reason not to use

added to the dict argument in so that the compiler warns me if i try to change the address dict is pointing that case you meant not dict declared the struct as not the pointer to do i also need to have const for otherwise you could use currptr to modify the dictionary struct which is supposed to be const in this line currptr is changing the currptr why the compile warn me about that if i added a const to not an error if the const is in the place you put it would be if the const were in the other place for i be able to access the dictionary in the main program cause i lost the address i was pointing when the main program calls it passes a pointer value into the and this becomes the value of dict in the get but get has its own pointer separate from the one in the main even if they just so happen to both be called changing one pointer change the variables point to the same so if you use the variable to modify any of the fields in the then of course the results will affect both bits of a function called would be a so right to make the parameter dict but i think the reason this is is slightly different from what you to protect the contents of the dictionary from not to protect your record of the address of is slightly awkward for linked lists like this even when you have a const its field still point to so although you modify the first the protect you from modifying other nodes in the addresses this with function so you can have a function which returns a const output if the input is but a output if the input is you could achieve a similar thing in c with a and the latter having a const parameter and but most people including standard library functions like which in c takes const but returns strchr can therefore be accidentally used in c to convert a const string into a without any or in which case a bit like laundering money through a business function does not require me to add a const before currptr and confess stumped on i would expect the same warning as in are you sure it but the parameter to del be const because potentially modifying the

are a number of patterns that approach what you i would recommend getting a copy of martin excellent book of enterprise specifically chapter presentation you will find that any serious attempt to separate the domain and data source will lead you to one of many variations of the same visual etc all break down to three layers what differs is the responsibilities of each layer and how layers communicate with each the pattern basically strips the ui layer of anything not directly related to the typicall example being a field you want to highlight if a certain condition is in a the form would only only contain the logic to determine the whether the field should be the business rule that this state would be in a layer which does not directly depend on the actual far as the data source the main benefit being able to switch databases at the drop of a the main benefit is that changes to the database schema only affect the data source layer and extend into the rest of the if your stuck with datasets a good approach is the data

are several syntax errors in this but since tofubeer has already pointed them out in the move on the the design and from the assuming you have much experience with and perhaps not with programming at so going to go slowly i hope you insulted by my say you are trying to find out how many of the objects which you are storing two in your array are to do you have to keep track of what unique objects you have already then you compare each object the list of unique objects if it match any of add it to the this is the basic have you noticed that i keep using the word in my when that it usually means you should be making a i would make a simple one like holding the two box or whatever the objects are private final int private final int public int height width public int return public int return public boolean if instanceof return box b return height public int int hash hash 97 hash hash 97 hash return to understand what each part of this code does if this is actually your once got move on to the next doing the calculation that you were trying to say you have an array of like boxes new new new new tell if using an array or a so just picking one to already gave the algorithm for finding the number of unique so show you how i would write unique new box if this is why i implemented and numofdifferentshape is much easier than trying to keep track of two ints for each plus it has the advantage that you get your array indices could do this even more easily with a it would look something like boxset new b numofdifferentshape that these last two snippets use features from so i know if run into them this make things

been rethinking my original answer i still suspect that using fewer threads would probably be a good but as just it actually be that io possible that just the files is taking a lot of disk i doubt that really running out of memory for the how much memory have you how much memory is the process taking how many threads are you and how many cores do you significantly more threads than you have cores is a bad suggest the following plan of out where the bottlenecks actually try fetching the list of files but not doing the moving see how hard the disk is and how long it with different numbers of with a queue of directories still to an eye on the memory use and garbage the windows performance counters for the clr are good for in c or using multiple processes what doing is akin to giving a single processor a hundred threads except doing it with the disk makes sense to parallelise tasks which use io if a fair amount of computation but if already disk asking the disk to work with lots of files at the same time is only going to make things may be interested in a benchmark and recently been testing of individual lines of a when the level of is low hardly doing any cpu the best results are always with a single	
been running a weekly meeting at our company for several become quite and more of a status update than anything looking for ideas to make this more are the guys who i think can generate great ideas and also have depth no one else has in a particular domain and body of is one of the few chances they have dedicated time to interact with each so i want to make that as productive as an not a but it seems like a waste of talent to have these guys sitting around for an hour telling me what they did last to make it even more there are folks that dial in from remote locations as i was hoping make it something less like a whiteboard discussion but not sure how much structure would be if ever read beautiful like something akin to the afternoon tea parties they had at princeton where they talked math on the chalk patterns for senior

been running up against a problem with java swing my wacom graphire tablet for a few years in several java applications and have now encountered it in my use a pen tablet to get around wrist issues while clicking a and it works fine under windows except when using java in java the of the pen work the problem only occurs with dialog boxes or tree the pen tablet also comes with a wireless mouse that works with the same and its does work know whether the problem is in the wacom driver or in the java swing runtime for windows or has anyone encountered this like to file a bug report with wacom but i have no idea what to tell have been able to reproduce this in my own application that has a jeditorpane with an html document that added a hyperlinklistener i get events on every single click with the but i do not get events on every single click with the big difference between a pen and a mouse is that when you click a button on a really easy to cause the without mouse on the pen tablet it is very hard to do and that seems to correlate with the lack of events if i am very careful not to move the pen position when i tap the i think i can get activated suggestions for things to try so i can give wacom some good information on this really frustrating to not be able to use my pen with java especially since the pen works fine with windows i ask this question here but like to find out from a standpoint what might be going on so i can file a good bug swing debugging headaches with wacom pen

being slow and reserve being no the implementation of stl used in msvc works something like when you first create a vector it reserves space for i think 10 from then whenever it gets it reserves space for times the number of elements in the something like the are if you know the exact can be prevent the vector from growing if it needs if you and the vector grows beyond that you have still improved things because of the if the vector turns out to be much maybe ok because the performance in general works better with smaller need to profile in release mode to know for sure what strategy works

best info i can find on this is the fact that you are calling tried using but it handle the cf so the best comparison is to look at the main in if you trace the it ends up calling in it creates a new thread context and runs its own message loop for the dialog i look into the actual cf i can only take an it would seem that it has to do with the fact that the exception happens on a separate message loop and will not be correctly be caught unless you process the message queue via causes the exception to be created on a separate message loop and the fact that it is caught does not get correctly processed unless you call happens if you try a regular do you still need i have an environment to test so i can only suggest that you try if you change it to a and no longer need i think that we would then know for sure whether or not if i was	
best solution to this will be to use a calendar this is incredibly useful and you can do all sort of interesting things including counting the number of working days between two dates or counting the number of holidays between two table is usually populated in advance say for 20 years with the date for well known holidays appropriately if holidays you maintain the table once in a while to mark the days as info and this uses ms sql but is easily ported as	
best thing to do is to throw an what there and any attempt to duplicate the behavior you get is likely to fail you use an for some use the example in the clause p2 returns 0 if it is technically a form of placement but it should either return a fully formed object or a null pointer that you need to test except that nobody your class can have an object that is there but not properly you can have a data member that serves as a flag as to whether the class is useful or nobody will check that flag in live in mind if you really need to have an allocation that is guaranteed not to you need to allocate the memory ahead of time and use placement and remove all initialization that might throw to another which somebody will fail to anything that allocates memory can particularly on the more confined sorts of systems that usually support the exceptions are the best way to

but not magic is not the number of lines in a input file which slows you down is a very small when an re is it basically has to write a program which can parse the input file based on that speed of that always depends on the complexity of the will be very will be somewhat slower and anything that involves backtracking having to back up in the usually anything involving multiple of which yours is an will be slower you can do to minimize the number of lines beforehand will help to some extent but as to optimizing the re often considered a black one possibility is to first strip out the lines other than those between lines where the annotation stops and tend to worry too much about optimizing my res not usually this my view is that they will take as long as they if too i usually look for another solution which is faster but not so the case of your re where you wanted to get all annotation xml where the attribute contains i would do it in perl awk for us since the input file was reasonably fixed on first line also on first line on last line and on its own would be fast as a simple line turning on echo when the conditions were met printing that printing any other line when echo was and turning echo off when conditions were met printing far less adaptable but almost certainly faster your

by point you mean the folder per i can see your i would simply add the reference to each test on the other you really mean put your tests in the same assembly as your i heartily agree with him and disagree with your tests should be distinct from your production code in order to enhance code clarity and keeping your test classes separate helps the next programmer understand it more if you need access to internals in your tests and you might since internal methods are to the you can use the internalsvisibleto construct in the would recommend in it is sufficient to unit test only the public interface of the done properly the private methods of your code will simply be refactorings of previous public code and will have sufficient test coverage through the public of this is a guideline not a law so there will be times that you might want to test a private in those you can create an accessor and use reflection to invoke the private recommendation that i would make is to use unit testing and code coverage in code coverage can be a useful heuristic to identify when you need more lack of coverage should be used as a guide to indicate where more testing may be this to say that you need coverage some code may be simple enough not to warrant a unit test for and they may not be touched by your existing were a couple of issues that i had with the probably the biggest is the lack of abstraction away from the database for unit there probably are some integration tests that need to go against the db perhaps when testing trigger or constraint functionality if you convince yourself of their correctness in of the opinion that you should implement your data access as then mock out the actual implementations in your unit tests so that there is no need to actually connect to the i find that my tests run and thus i run them more often when i do building up a database interface might take a little while but can be reused as long as you stick with the same design pattern for your data i would recommend using nunit with a very useful plugin whether doing nunit or makes it very handy to run or debug tests with a context

can pass an array by but you have to first wrap it in a struct or or simply use a type like think the decision was for the sake of one want to do this most of the the same reasoning as why there are no unsigned there is no associated cpu so you have to make not efficient very hard to do in a language like and boost both have wrapped native arrays into structs providing and which i would always prefer because it allows passing and returning of arrays within array is a pointer to the memory that holds that array and the note it is not the exact same as a pointer to the first element of the people think that you have to pass an array as a pointer and specify the size as a separate but this is not you can pass a reference to the actual array itself while maintaining you need the size because you have reduced your array to an pointing to the first int function can take in an array of size as test2 but by to access elements you need to people may say that the size of an array is not this is not what about allocations on the allocations on the heap do not return an they return a pointer to the first element of an so new is not type if you do indeed have an array then you will know the size of what it

code is still not cart cart new new is because two threads can both get a of create new shopping cart and insert them into the one of them will meaning one will set the object used by future but the other will for this request use a totally different make this you would need to do something like following the idiom from the article you shoppingcart cart if cart new if the above if two threads using the same enter the loop at the same there is no data race that can cause them to use different address the part of the problem that brian goetz address in the namely how do you get the into the session in the first an easy and not way to do implement a session listener and put the empty objects into the session in its class sessioninitializer implements httpsessionlistener public void httpsession session new public void no special action method will be called once for each only when it is so this is an appropriate place to do any initialization that is needed for a the servlet spec does not require that there is a relationship between calling in your listener and calling your so this is apparently not guaranteed to be thread and can potentially vary in behavior between different servlet if there is even a chance that a given session can have more than one request in flight at a this is not safe in this you need to use a lock of some sort to initialize the you could do something like session ensure that the session is cartref if cartref new the above code has your session is the is guaranteed to be in the and in a you can either update the shopping cart object in the same synchronized block dispense with the all together just put the cart itself into the or you can update the with code shown earlier which is better depends on how much initialization you need to how long it will take to perform this on whether doing in the synchronized block will hurt performance too much is best determined with a not with a and so in my own i just use a synchronized block and use if i ever determined that synchronization was causing a liveness problem in my then i would potentially move some more expensive initializations out of synchronized blocks by using tricks like the httpsession thread are attribute thread safe

code will get each question and answers and store them into a hash for each question this the best datastructure for hashing is a good simple hashing all that strong so you should read up on you should probably add a i store the real answer as a hidden html or go to the db again when user clicks submit so that i can match the hidden html is still visible if you view the so be giving your answers the only way to do this is to do all the checking on the server

common lisp implementations can dump executable sometimes these are two files but often this can be just one but the executable usually runs only on the platform it was compiled commercial implementations like lispworks or allegro cl have extended capabilities for example one can remove unused parts of the lisp this is called is some information about lispworks is commercial and covering platforms can be you would have to buy the development environment delivery is free on popular lispworks has a graphical library for mac and the latter is based on the oldish the advantage is that the code can be very portable over the lispworks development environment itself is a lispworks on the mac for example the 32bit version and the 64bit version runs on both powerpc and x86 from a single about versions of common lisp and libraries is collected on ms windows applications is not the strongest part of common	
company has two or three web apps that use a lot of common code a custom mvc utility javascript and so prefer not to duplicate all this code in each because we end up with several slightly different versions of it in but we want the apps to require the same exact copy of this because we want an update to one app to potentially break anyone have any tips on dealing with this i think looking for a technical answer more of just a general could make the code into a and allow apps to remain on an older version of the library until ready to or we could make it into multiple so we have to upgrade everything at but would it become difficult to manage the interdependencies between versions of the apps with common code how to approach	
compiler for this type of checks i always fallback to compiler before going back to the standard and 6 for copyright comeau all rights errors line is not allowed in a template virtual void line is not allowed in a template virtual void as it has been posted by other the fact is that the standard does not allow you to define virtual templated the rationale is that for all virtual an entry must be reserved in the the problem is that template methods will only be defined when they have been instantiated this means that the vtable would end up having a different number of elements in each compilation depending on how many different calls to with different types then hell would be what you want is a templated function on one of its arguments and one specific version being virtual the part of the you can do template void t a virtual void int a derived public virtual void int a derived b 5 compiler will prefer the method and print you want this generalized for any then you are out of consider other type of delegation instead of polymorphism delegation could be a more info on the problem at hand would help in determining a

constructor is declared as which means that it be used for implicit type implicit conversion to could easily lead to undesirable situations since the is taking ownership of the if would allow implicit conversion from a pointer and you accidentally passed a pointer to a method taking an the pointer would be silently converted to an and subsequently deleted when the function even if that the but by marking the constructor as explicit conversion can no longer happen silently and by calling the constructor you clearly express the intention of passing ownership to the thus avoiding any potential assume implicit conversion is do stuff with new normally this

controls are a form of custom that gives you a visual they are ideal for use when you want a reusable control within the same web is possible to create and package user controls as seperate assemblies but that is beyond the scope of this question and i know has been asked on custom control is typically used to refer to a web or a composite control which is specialized form of a web these controls have no designer and are usually implemented in seperate projects from your web allowing them to be reused accross many your second ascx and aspx are two different ascx is the extension for a user where as aspx is an you cannot use an ascx by itself it must be placed onto an aspx or master way i like to use user controls is i have for example a very complex page which have 7 5 of those have of those grids three of them are well what i can do is create a seperate user control for the content of the this now reduces the code i need down significantly three grids are identicle except for the more it allows multiple to work on various parts of the and it helps me keep everything straight since i am reducing the complexity of the you do not use user controls instead of you use them in conjuction with a do not use ascx over you use ascx to for example on my site every page has the same but i want every page to derive from a single master i can create my footer as an acsx control and put it in each of my master i have a form that lets a user enter three different date we have other so i put the logic to enable a calender and a text box that when clicked on opens up the in a user i can then reuse that user control in all my aspx

cost depends on which class is implementing and the specific usage the will very depending on the implementation you are in typically a fairly low overhead many it can be as simple as a check to see if the current thread is the same as the original being if you need worth the even if only of the time that it will be it should be you are asking for a or some other very undesirable most cases where you could be using this are cases where you should always include this most common use case is synchronizing delegates onto the ui in this you must use or very bad things in this the cost is very low compared to the waiting on the message pump for ui so really not worth worrying you are using it with a custom implementation of and happening in a tight and profiled and found that causing problems for then it may be worth worrying in this i would recommend trying to rework the algorithm itself to avoid the need for synchronizing as much as but still use invokerequired as

could dynamically build an inline style sheet in the head of the html page fed to the put in the head of the page and allow it to target those elements configurable by the the notion of using external stylesheets that feature the most common but be hundreds of them to account for every possible if you use this need an external style sheet for a specific font colour and so and dynamically link to those in the as with any external though this is almost unbearably complex to one would work okay an p populate all this with values from the a it just occurred to me that you could probably create a stylesheet to apply the configurable clearly the second is a stylesheet created for bonus of this approach is that it allows caching of the stylesheet by the though it might likely clutter up the css unless you have specific to the user this could get

current intranet environment is a little the current stack has applications that are querying against a sql 2000 role there are user groups on the servers that users are added into you need to be added into the group on the test and production these user groups are synchronized into user roles on sql 2000 roles are granted execute permissions to stored procedures as needed to prevent any access the web application we use basic authentication authenticates against our active and have identity impersonation turned the connection string to the database uses integrated this creates an environment where the web application connects to the database as the user logged which will enforce database security on stored procedures being it also allows us to use the typical method to perform authorization within the application are several problems with the first is that only our server administrators have access to the user groups on the so updating role or adding additional users is out of the hands of the application in the only way to get the role was to call a sql procedure called which is locked down in sql while i know the full our dba tells us that this general model play nice with sql 2005 given the nature of schemas in the newer at the point now that ready to update our writing apps to leverage more ajax and sql server 2005 is the primary environment for our looking to update the security model as well to be a bit more flexible for the application and potentially leverage active directory concern we have as well is that a given user will most likely have access to multiple so having some kind of centralized solution is optimal so we can easily remove users when is considered the best practice for maintaining role security in this kind of is the best practice for role security for an intratnet

definition of has no parameter named you need to pass the type and variable name to the you only passed the if you use the name grid for the that name has nothing to do with your declaration of you could have used any other name as you pass arrays as to easy way to fix this is to pass a pointer to an array to the function and type safe variable created on the stack comes out of scope when the block it is declared in is a block is anything within an opening and closing for example an i said variable and not for example you can allocate memory on the heap and that data will still remain valid even outside of the but the variable that originally pointed to it would still come out of

depends on the caching policy for the page and the method used for fetching the page in the first if you fetched the page via a a refresh will the post data while putting the url in a new window will issue a get to the the original request is a the behaviour depends on how the current page is hitting refresh will cause the browser to check back with the server for the page not necessarily any scripts or if the page is set to be cacheable then pasting the url in a new window might well just pull the page out of cache without hitting the that checking with the server necessarily cause the page to be regenerated or redownloaded as the browser can issue a conditional get or a head request to check whether the page has actually changed since last while some of the actions might pull the page from the no guarantee it will dynamically generated pages usually have to be set up properly to be considered cacheable at

did what arno setagaya suggested in his made some sample tests and compared the compression tests were done using 5 each of them 4096 bytes in each byte inside of these 5 files was generated in real the data would not likely be all but would tend to have quiet a bit of repeating thus in real life application the compression would tend to be a bit better then the following each of the 5 files was compressed by itself not together with the other 4 which would result in better in the following results i just use the sum of the size of the 5 files together for included rar just for comparison even though it is not open best to 20775 20480 100 of original 20825 20480 100 of original 20827 20480 100 of original 21020 20480 100 of original 22899 20480 100 of original to my surprise all of the tested algorithms produced a larger size then the i guess they are only good for compressing larger or files that have a lot of repeating bytes random data like the thus i will not be using any type of compression on my tcp maybe this information will be useful to others who consider compressing small pieces of forgot to mention that i used default options for each of the

error means that sometime in the future the compiler will behave the way you expect it to behave it compile the source file when you directly access an instance variable outside the defined visibility now the compiler simply enforcing the visibility the warning is to remind you that doing something that you be doing and bring you attention to that in case you did it by i had to hazard a guess as to why the visibility say that with all the bridging stuff between the foundation library and the corefoundation there is probably a decent amount of library code that accesses instance variables strictly should not be a bad idea to directly access instance variable as long as you can use probably better to use something like properties if designing a model

explicitly specializing a function without fully specializing all outer template is not possible explicit function specialization is a real function there be any around it that are still parameterized by a simple way is to use a type2type template together with struct t2t typedef t parm1 arg2 class class v void parm1 parm2 class type void parm1 parm2 it will call the second overload if you call it with and the first because the first one is less is possible parm1 arg2 class type typename parm1 parm2 class type typename parm1 parm2 the second one is taken if is and the first one is taken if is something else but using a different this one is called an alternative but which again adds one parameter is this to demonstrate the way sfinae parm1 arg2 class type parm1 parm2 class type parm1 parm2 happens if the substitution of a template parameter yields to an invalid type or we try to create a pointer to an array of size 0 or 1 an array of size 0 is not and will cause an sfinae failure the corresponding template specialization will not be considered as a if it is a the case it works if is given something derived from then it makes its typedef not derives itself from in the case types are not the we would then try to access a not existent name which is an invalid construct and would therefor be an sfinae failure

few more will be added to this list but i will have the complete restricted i do not have the complete list of allowed characters would be too long even i try to get it and would include all chars like certain foreign will eventually have the list of disallowed characters and probably not the list of allowed must have either the list of all allowed characters or the list of all disallowed else you cannot tell if the input is further if you have one of the you have the second implicitly if the character set is then just implement the shorter but if you use there will probably be much more characters you want to disallow than to allow think of all the fancy chinees and japanes so i think you should really build a list of allowed characters and use ranges like where you really want to build the list of disallowed you will have to build a regular expression like do not forget to escape the characters if required and use ranges if so many chars in the not allowed list like does not seem to are spaces in your are they in your i am not but may be this might be a

first version of fieldstorage contains a the size of the fieldstorage class includes enough bytes to hold a when you construct a the vector is constructed right before the body of constructor is when a fieldstorage is so is the does not necessarily allocate the vector on the if you a fieldstorage then the space for the vector comes from that heap not the if you define a global fieldstorage then the space for the vector comes from neither the stack nor the but rather from space designated for global objects the or section on some that the vector performs heap allocations to hold the actual so it is likely to only contain a few or a pointer and couple of but it may contain whatever your stl implementation needs it second version of fieldstorage contains a pointer to a the size of the fieldstorage class includes room for a pointer to a not an actual you are allocating storage for the vector using new in the body of and you leaking that storage when fieldstorage is because you define a destructor that deletes the

for the delay in an i was a bit busy the past couple of is my answer based on the following you will be cleaning up name spelling issues via some other mechanism mentioned that you would clean it up using regular expressions in a comment to your original a dup set can be identified using and birth mentioned this in a comment to your original and birth can not be you cannot have more than one fin record in a dup set mentioned this in a comment to your original any of the above assumptions are not valid then my answer will have to be following are the steps to update all fin records to copy over the personalkey from the update pruebas join pruebas on and and set where like and is and is not delete all records where we have a fin delete from pruebas join pruebas on and and where like and not like this point all the dups with a fin record have been cleaned so that only the fin record is if we decide to stay with the drv record for all other we will need to copy the personalkey from another record to the drv update pruebas join pruebas on and and set where like and is and is not delete all records where we have a drv delete from pruebas join pruebas on and and where like and not like this point all the dups with a drv record have been cleaned so that only the drv record is the only other record type is the sa then there should be no more dups left and if we want to choose the record with the most information filled in or if we finished 3 and 4 and there is more than one record type still left causing we need to copy the personalkey from any record in a dup set that has it to any record that have it for all update pruebas join pruebas on and and set where not like and is and is not delete all records except for the one with the most information defined by the computed delete from pruebas join as from pruebas inner join as is not is not is not is not as from pruebas group by having on and and and is not is not is not is not group by on and and and this point all the dups have been collapsed with the personalkey saved if it was available and fin records were saved if they existed otherwise either the drv record or the record with the most information was me know if you have any questions with any of the it

from data access a major factor in code is data less data means more of it fits into the is mainly a factor with data wisdom says data structures must be aligned at word boundaries because the cpu can only access entire and if a word contains more than one you have to do extra work instead of a simple but caches can completely invalidate this a java boolean array uses an entire byte for each value in order to allow operating on individual values you can reduce the data size by a factor of 8 if you use actual but then access to individual values becomes much more requiring bit shift and mask operations class does this for due to cache this can still be considerably faster than using a when the array is iirc i once achieved a speedup by a factor of 2 or 3 this

further support ivans answer above lucene is the way to you mentioned what platform on so point out that you can use a port of this you do use lucene there is a very good book from manning on the subject which i recommend you look it comes to populating your you have a couple of for starters you can just dump all of your text into the index and allow the engine to just search on recommend adding fixed fields to your index which will allow you to support things such as partitioned searches or searches against those fields lets say you have a field for the then you can partition your index by restricting the index search to those documents that have that website in that other process is to extract points of interest from your document and allow searches on those without searching the entire index your mileage may vary with this as the lucene engine is very well written so it may simply allow you to collect your searches into more logical units which helps you with your done this myself and it helps when answering management questions about what exactly is searched and

going to need the email address in the then have to store them in plain could encrypt of this is effectively security through obscurity in this if your perimeter is your data within it can be plain encrypting here adds complexity to you working with the but really stop an attacker from getting your raw you if he gets through your perimeter likely to easily get your decryption key to decrypt the email encryption may slow down the determined attacker but will not add any real security to your best scenario is to hash the email address and store this allows you to check the email address against an input value and verify that the email address input is the same as what you have of the major downside for this is that you know what the email address is without that additional so if wanting to regularly email your be out of suspect storing the email address because useful and you want to do something with it send an email in which encrypting just adds overhead to working with that whilst gaining very little in this i would focus on securing access the database itself your and ensure they are as strong as can whilst leaving the data in the database in plain

handlers are not dom the attribute exists in markup only not sure why ff oks go research that now cause i want to seems to be mixed feelings about whether eventhandlers are attributes or looks to me like this is fault as they internally do not treat them as whilst the html spec indicates that they very much the direct consequences of this are that a number of things would consider attributes cannot be set with setattribute in ie including eventhandler bindings and importantly also class and apparently ie8 fixes this but i still installed that so i for event binding use the pair or preferably because a direct set directly to your target method more likely a closure on your fix your styling not being correctly applied use or the problem is avoid using

has the right answer about checking the totalmemory could probably use a paging although more and more data is loaded from the server i think all the data is used at all you could get data from the server and gradually save on the computer in a watch out for silesize limitations and you would keep track of what data is available say data from index 0 to if the user wants to see data between 200 and 300 you get stored if it aleady stored of if not request the data and inform the user that data is on are a few handy link related totalmemory and the garbage what i think is more suited since there a lot data from the might be is the safe limit of flash memory on web scenario and how well is as bit

have a 3d modeling right now drawing the meshes but like to switch to single sided when the object is the polygonal mesh is closed boundary it seems like i should always be able to determine if the object is currently and automatically flipped means that my normals point into the object instead of out of the being flipped is a result of a mismatch between my winding rules and the current frontface but i compute the normals directly from the so looking at the normals is a simple way to detect thing i was thinking was to take the bounding find the highest and see if its normal points up or down if then the object is it seems like this solution might be prone to errors with degenerate or floating point as only be looking at a single i guess i could get all 6 but that seems like a slightly better and not a proper there a simple way to do robust and hard would also a closed polygonal mesh

have a database that i wish to build an ef model however i do not want to include certain columns from the database as the columns concerned are maintained exclusively on the server and should not be manipulated by any of the columns are datetime this makes any one of the columns is nullable and is maintained by a trigger on updates and the other is not nullable and set using a default value in the table guess i am looking for something like the option in but i cannot find such an anybody tell me how to work around have been trying to introduce business object modelling at my place of work for some years and it has always been rejected because of the amount of additional code that has to be ef is currently being seen as a viable solution because of the designer and code generation therefore any option that involves the xml will only turn the rest of my colleagues away from i am therefore looking for something that can be done either using the designer or using guess that what i am looking for here is a way to create the model without ef referencing the columns in the store and therefore not looking to manipulate it in any a way to programatically set the attribute against the property when i create the objectcontext easy answer is to manually manipulate this in the but this would then be overwritten if i refreshed the model from the database and i cannot go down the route where the are ignore

have a great deal of respect for mono and i would like to utilize csla on operating i accept the fact that mono will always be two steps behind but mono supports enough of the framework to facilitate a wide range of interesting i also realize that mono does not support many of the additions such as wpf it must to a small degree for moonlight to for my current wpf support is not nor is i sincerely appreciate all the tedious data binding support rocky has implemented and continues to maintain in for many this is where i see csla adding substantial i realize csla brings many other features to the but for me data binding is very i suspect that the main compatibility issues with csla under mono are centered around mono not implementing all the data binding nuances and serialization format i have a few ideas on how to attack these perceived but i would love to hear from anyone that has already been down this what i did post this exact question on the csla forum quite some time the csla community and rocky are quick to answer this question never received any i believe the reason for this is rocky has been focused only on ms tech for a long i fault him for rocky has a substantial investment in he is the benevolent thankful that he made csla open i suspect he has enough issues keeping up with the major api churn every couple of years in the microsoft os is probably not on his it probably should not most linux or mac os folks have never even heard of can always fork the strip it to make it work with if you do you have the csla community behind you least for for this i have abandoned this seems that rocky is interested in mono check out the have experience using csla under

have a method that is called on an object to perform some business logic and add it to the object is a and part of the business logic requires searching the databses for related accounts and history items on the are then a series of comparisons and operations that need to bring back information from the account and apply it to the transaction before the transaction is then passed on to other people and written to the only way i can think of for testing this currently is within the test to create an account and the relevant history then to construct a transaction for each different scenario and capture the information written to the db for the transaction and information being passed however this feels like its testing way too much in one each scenario would be performed in a separate unit with the test construction refactored out into separate but the actual piece of code targetted by the test is over 500 lines guess this question is more about refactoring than unit but in this case they go hand in anyone has any advice or then be glad to hear account for transaction validation on transaction codes and values transaction with info from account related history from account handle different transaction codes and values different each with different the transaction again with new account info from business transaction to do i break this down into unit

have a program running as root on talking to a tty an lcd implemented as a the device for what worth is like to have my program that writes to this device be able to have exclusive access to the so as to not have any interference from other instances of the program running at the same see that a ioctl option called tiocexcl which will prevent additonal of the device to wit calls to the same file will succeed unless the tiocexcl ioctl is this will prevent additional opens except by i tested this and it works just as if a user tries to open i changed the then the open fails with something like and if a root user tries to open it i ideally want is a way to this exclusive access to the tty to work for root so have multiple root users using the program that writes to the but somehow their access to the lcd would be apparently the tiocexcl ioctl option will not work for me since it stop root users from opening an tty guess there are a number of options but i am reaching out to all to see if you might have other thoughts or missing something about using some other way via or or to get exclusive there was some way i could detect that some other process has the device i could just wait and i know about lsof but loath to invoke it from inside this program just to learn and there are race conditions with i can get over could implement locking like apparently used to be done to get exclusive access to tty the only program writing to the lcd device is i am inclined to do something like the following to lock inside the do any do any sleep a tad to not flash messages too fast on exclusive access to a tty device from a root program on

have any practical experience with that sort of but if i was in your situation the place go looking would be eclipse the equivalent in pro for if what what you want is a match and except that your regular expressions should match abstract syntax trees rather than plain what automated refactorings risk of this refactoring is that the target version is less precise than the person public int public int is no way to tell which of these constructors the chained call to should be replaced automated support for this would have to check for such ambiguities before allowing you to if there is already a constructor with the target abort the than that it seems pretty give the new constructor the following int you can safely replace the original call with the is a subtle additional in that calling withage within the on a partially constructed quite the same as calling it after the the difference matters if you have an inheritance chain if withage does something but then what your unit tests are

i did some experiments with prepared dynamic statements using odbc in java some years with both oracle and sql server i found that prepared statements could be as much as faster for certain but there were differences regarding which queries were improved to what should not be bottom line is that if you will be the same query prepared statements may help improve but if your performance is bad enough that you need to do something about it count on the use of prepared statements to give you a radical is usually nothing to write home mileage may of

i finally figured out a working the for updating this is mainly because must run within a you can try running it within the existing but that is probably tied to the same persistence context of the entity what this means is that after you update you have to find a way to the the easy way is to call but this results in all sorts of side effects about it in the jpa the better solution is to get the underlying delegate my a hibernate and call this will probably work on simple domain but mine were very i was never able to get to work correctly with my existing jpa like i also tried manually passing my domain graph a and having each parent entity evict its this also work for unknown was left in a situation where only would but i accept the side i then tried creating a separate persistence unit specifically for entity i figured i could localize the operation to only that pc in charge of i set up a new a new corresponding a new transaction manager for and manually injecting this transaction manager into the repository for manual wrapping of the in a transaction corresponding to the proper here i have to say that i know enough about container managed because it ended up being a nightmare trying to get the transaction for to play nicely with the container managed transaction getting pulled in from the service this point i threw out everything and created this class jdbcuserconversionrepository implements userconversionrepository userservice jdbctemplate user user final class update the user set where new before we try to load our converted user back into the we need to remove them from the pc so the try to load the cached one in the keep in mind that of the child entities of this user will remain in the this normally cause a problem when the pc is throwing a entity in this specific we return a new reference which replaces the old this means if we just evict then remove all references to the pc will not be able drill down into the children and try to persist reload the converted user into the persistence return public void datasource new are two important parts of this method which i believe make it marked it with should suspend the container managed transaction coming in from the service layer and allow the conversion to take place external of the trying to reload the converted entity back into the i evict the old copy currently stored in the pc with the code for this is simply getting a instance and calling see the comments in code for more but basically if we do this any calls to will try to return the cached entity still in the except that it will throw an error about the type being my initial tests have gone this solution may still have some i will keep this updated as they are

i have undestood what is your real then you need a sort of timer which automatically extends every user session client consequentely overriding the server side default page session expiration timing usually 30 only for detail because i understood that the script every 30 seconds if the user is active on the page so before jsf i always extended inactive user sessions via underground so use it also in your pratically you can build a simple page listener in javascript starting expression msecintervaltiming can be a called function in which you invoke some dummy jsf needed to keep the session alive without reloading the current page visited by the in the past i used standard frame or iframe to make http now with xhr ajax is more simple timerid invoked by some user event denoting his absence here goes all events and logic you need and know for firing the if avoid timerid msecintervaltiming make iframe or make action like page reloading or other invoked by some user event denoting his active it can be also the global variable timerid you use the as a global reference to keep track of the listener so when you need to activate the you assign it a instead when the user come back to the page by some event you you clear the timeout stopping the listener above example obviously implies that the when comes must reload the page in your specifical avoid to interfere with javascript automatically generated by icefaces even for you could simulate periodically some user events on invisible input elements set on not on this causes the icefaces event to not stop it and making itself work like on which you can call periodically invoke the click event by the see the old great js docs of devedge online	
i hear the term flow based programming i think of ie component processes scheduling is driven primarily by a change to its input this really is lego programming in the sense that the labview platform was used for the latest crop of mindstorm however i disagree that this makes it a less useful programming industrial systems which typically involve data and it fits very what is any control system if not data in transformed to data ie what component in your control scheme would you not prefer to represent as a black box in a bigger if you could do to achieve that level of architectural clarity using other methodologies you might have to draw a data domain class then a problem domain run time class then on top of that a use case and flip back and forth between with flow driven systems you have the luxury of being able to collapse a lot of this information together accurately enough that you can realistically design a system visually once the components are build and question i never had to ask when looking at an application written in labview is piece of code set this as it was inherent and easy to trace backwards from the and also mistakes like multiple untintended writers were impossible to create by only that was true of code written in a more typically procedural

i love and agree with andy and one other approach you may want to consider is to have a typed master all you have to do is add one directive in your aspx mastertype of accessing a control from your master consider accessing a control in your master page from the page this approach makes a lot of sense when you have a header label on your master and want to set its value from each page that uses the not but i think this would be simpler technique with nested master as you would just point the virtualpath to the master containing the control you wish to it might prove to be tricky though if you want to access two one in each respective master

i tend to be in the restful programming is being identified by a persistent uris are the ubiquitous choice of identifier these being manipulated using a common set of http methods are the commonly seen case the venerable becomes and actual representation retrieved for a resource is dependent on the request and not the use http accept headers to control whether you want or even a java object representing the the state in the object and representing the state in the the relationships between resources in the representation of the the links between objects are embedded directly in the representations describe how the representation can be used and under what circumstances it should be in a consistent usage of http last one is probably the most important in terms of consequences and overall effectiveness of most of the restful discussions seem to center on http and its usage from a browser and what i understand that fielding coined the term when he described the architecture and decisions that lead to his thesis is more about the architecture and of resources than it is about you are really interested in what a restful architecture is and why it read a few times and read the not just chapter next look into dns read about the hierarchical organization of dns and how referrals then read and consider how dns caching read the http specifications and in and consider how and why the caching works the way that it it will just the final revelation for me was when i saw the similarity between dns and after understanding why soa and message passing interfaces are scalable starts to think that the most important trick to understanding the architectural importance and performance implications of a restful and architectures is to avoid getting hung up on the technology and implementation concentrate on who owns who is responsible for then think about the and

i think the cast where runtime type is should allowed if d is a c and the difference to c are added this should be should it at if you could make this then you could compile code that attempted to call one of the on this which would fail at runtime since that method does not exist in think you are imagining that the cast would detect the methods that are from c and delegate them to d i doubt that would be although i speak to the language design seems to me the solution to your problem class which extends c and implements a constructor which essentially clones the state of the given c object into a new d d object can be passed to your existing code because it is a and it can be passed to code that wants an i because it is an

i understand all member functions are virtual in d but the compiler is free to make functions if it sees that they are never not clear on is what happens when you compile a module in which member functions are not overridden and then import that module somewhere else where you override a member i think it the original does it simply assume that any member function with external linkage is there a way to ensure that member functions are virtual in

if you want to simplify i would look at using an orm to do the look at entity framework or one of the other billion or so out it will remove a lot of noise from suggestion would be to continue the refactoring you were i like how you absrtacted if you look at your a person have a previous what your doing is leaking a requirement to track previous within your domain i would move all of that and define a which would have two class public person public person think this cleans up a lot of the i also like to handle the multiple phone numbers using a dictionary essentially we class phonetype string string string people might make phone have so i want to debate or you could just have a single string like you one thing to keep in mind is internaitonalization if this on my person i would have a this allows you then to break your four inserts into a single loop as you loop over the phone i would use a simillar model if you have a billing or ship to you go with an one way to help adhere to dry with your sql params is the following code is not meant to be compiled but just to show you a pattern to again minimize class public void using public void using add the id since we have it in updates but not in private void sqlcommand all the code to add params which exists in both insert and what done is consolidated so when you add a new property to a person you only have to modify one function when dealing with more thing to insert your current and previous you are not being you could do void int addresstype from your insert person routine you would call this method course if you take my earlier suggestions this might look very totally missed this but i wanted to highlight what chris said i you but felt it was such a good thing i had to repeat use

is no correct and definitive answer to your it depends on what you are going to if it is to maintain some sort of code learning awk and sed makes if it is just for personal pleasure that is also if it is to maintain a script that nobody can because nobody knows and sed then it does not make sense to learn the languages and if you can rewrite the script with proper testing and reproduce it with no bugs then learning a new language does not make with regards to your time more than on scripting language works well since in most cases people are not too familiar with in which case they would most likely know at least also if you are on a team where most people know then it would make sense to learn those believe that learning something new that you can get to use in your daily life as a developer not only adds value to your skill set but also helps keeping the mind

is the best way to constrain the values of a prng to a smaller if you use modulus and the old max number is not evenly divisible by the new max number you bias toward the through i assume the best way would be something like this is floating not integer something in my gut makes me question that method floating point implementation and representation random number generator will produce consistent results across hardware and software and the constraint needs to as was right to doubt the pseudocode above not for the reasons i was got me thinking about the problem in a different i can model it using smaller numbers and test every assume we have a prng that produces a random number between 0 and 31 and you want the smaller range to be 0 to if you use modulus you bias toward and if you use the pseudocode above you bias toward and i think there can be a good way to map one set into the the best that i have come up with so far is to regenerate the random numbers that are greater than but that has deep problems as well the time to generate new numbers until one is in the right think i may have naively approached this it may be time to start some serious research into the literature has to have tackled this is the proper method of constraining a number to a smaller

is worthwhile separating the mysql upgrade from the table that reduces the potential range of if restarting the database is a rare then take some time to review the innodb server options before the because many of them need a database the two recommended are and them and you should also look at as it is almost certainly going to be too low if has changed is going to be around for a long it is a very robust format that has some qualities useful for many in it has a fast which can be useful for a smallish table that has no or very few that a very hot table and lots of will benefit from being migrated to innodb because myisam does not support concurrent almost always survives a database crash with nothing more than a innodb is not always so the myisam can also be out from under the even if you lock the table you will very likely get a file that will just innodb files are not so this is why recently went through a mysql upgrade and we only had one sql version parser was fairly forgiving when mixing implicit table joins with explicit version 5 is not so so we took the opportunity to scour the app and upgrade all the to explicit apart from one or two spots that were this was very recommend you setup a test environment with php 4 talking to mysql this will let you test all this

like to add a comment that you may wish to think of my clients run including a couple who have moderately large both of whilst they certainly could implement a payment gateway choose not they take the cc store it temporarily encrypted online and process it do this because of the high incidence of fraud and manual processing allows them to take additional checks before filling an told that they reject a little over of all their transactions processing manually certainly takes extra time and in one case they have an employee who does nothing but process but the cost of paying his salary is apparently less than their exposure if they just passed cc numbers though an online of these clients are delivering physical goods with resale so are particularly exposed and for items like software where a fraudulent sale result in any actual loss your mileage would but worth considering above the technical aspects of an online gateway if implementing such is really what you and since creating this answer like to add a cautionary tale and say that the time is past when this was a good because i know of another contact who was taking a similar the card details were stored the website was accessed by and the numbers were deleted immediately after secure you one machine on their network got infected by a key logging as a result they were identified as being the source for several score credit card forgeries and were consequently hit by a large a result of this i now advise anyone to handle credit cards payment gateways have since become much more competitive and cost and fraud measures have the risk is now no longer worth could delete this but i think best to leave up edited as a cautionary

may want to have a look at the template it allows you to use high level code that uses optimized assembler with support for expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable lazy when that is appropriate eigen takes care of this automatically and handles aliasing too in most explicit vectorization is performed for the sse and and altivec instruction with graceful fallback to expression templates allow to perform these optimizations globally for whole with dynamic memory allocation is and the loops are unrolled when that makes for large special attention is paid to api the api is extremely clean and thanks to expression implementing an algorithm on top of eigen feels like just copying you can use complex expressions and still rely on eigen to produce optimized there is no need for you to manually decompose expressions into small

my specific i am making use of a discriminator column this means that my jpa implementation creates a table with a special this column contains the class name of the for my table can have subclasses of and these class names would be in the column so that when the entitymanager loads the entity from the it knows which type of class to tried two ways of converting entity types and both feel like dirty a native query to manually do an update on the changing its this works for entities whose property constraints are a new entity of the target do a call to move over the save the new then call a named query which manually replaces the new id with the old id so that all the foreign key constraints are problem with is that when you manually change this jpa know how to this entity to the persistance it expects a with id not a with id it fails here i could probably do an and detach all the but since this is a service it would wipe pending changes for all users of the problem with is that when you delete the all of the properties you have set to will be deleted as this is bad because only trying to swap in a different not delete all the extended object the problems of have made it all but unusable for so given up on trying to get it to the more elegant of the hacks is definitely and i have made some progress in this the key is to first get a reference to the underlying hibernate session using hibernate as your jpa and call the method to remove only that single object from your persistance unfortunitely there is no pure jpa support for here is some sample make sure we save any pending user remove the user instance from the persistence final session session update the final string sqlstring user set where final query query problem here load the user with its new return the manual which throws this detached entity passed to can see that the of which has a onetomany is causing some i know enough about going on behind the scenes to crack this the only thing that works so far is to change dtype as shown in the above then call completely understand the ramifications of clearing the entire persistence and i would have liked to get working on the particular entity being updated to change entity type in	
my you have already set option explicit on and option strict on whatever off option infer in the ide and project on option infer in code files when you need this ensures that code is easy to and when it is it alerts the reader to be on the lookout for its use and reminds them to hover over the var to see its option explicit is option infer on allows old vb6 code full of variants to compile and run better since the compiler assigns a type to the vars at compile rather than allowing the var to be late testing should be done to ensure that vars do not store multiple types during their this is not a substitute for a proper refactoring of vb6 code ported to dot variants are

not any detail on the requirements of your application which is really key to answering the big win for using gwt is the ease of deployment relative to something like there is nothing easier for the user than pointing their web browser at a url and nothing easier for the operations team than pushing code to the bouncing it and calling it a far as the big area where gwt will come up short would be richer data network this stuff is possible with gwt and some help on the server but the limitations of dhtml start to show even with a powerful toolkit like on the other rcp gives you the full power of java 2d to visualize anything you these kinds of features may not be necessary to you but also the ones that make applications really more than just a mess of tree and data grid been developing with adobe flex for several years now and find it to be really having more or less the same deployment advantages as something like gwt but offering the same kind of power as you might want to check that out

not much obviously better than marching through the string a character at a time and making sure the user entered only ones and keep in mind that even though you could write a fast assembly routine if you everything is or you really want to do the user could enter and like to be able to tell them if they screwed up or true that this seems slow compared to the couple cycles it probably takes to add the actual but does it really matter if you get your answer in a nanosecond or a humans can only detect 30 milliseconds of latency it already takes far longer to get input from the user and write output to the screen than it does to parse the string or add the so your algorithm is hardly the bottleneck save your fancy optimizations for things that are actually computationally intensive you should focus on here is making the task less it turns out someone already did that for a look at char char int will let you convert a string in any base to a it checks sample usage for converting a binary number bad try else number is now a long converted from a valid binary base 2 tells to convert binary

nov 2011 a of what i say below is still true however i have now got serious reservations about recommending realbasic for anyone trying to release to save me remembering to edit this post see if realsoftware have managed to release a robust version of their ide using the cocoa version of their if be very with a heavy heart that i write this because i still really like the language and think the framework and ide are the problem is apparently one of and possibly a software development culture inside the company that consistently fails to deal with a bug regression many bugs are fixed each release but there appears to be a huge tax on the developers in the number of introduced they have a very small team for the complexity of the especially considering the newly released web edition which is effectively an entirely new still theoretically a great product but take advantage of the trial test it thoroughly on each of the platforms you plan to target and decide if you can live with any bugs you find because they may be there for a language is a modern oo language that be hard for you to adapt to from your vaguely remembered pascal or current it has most of the power of without the dangerous bits that make debugging a you will also find the ide simpler and easier to deal with than say visual ide makes it very easy to throw together a gui and have it just work on multiple the pro version has one of the best debuggers used and it is easy to just work on a mac and develop for windows and compiling and testing with one is also a thriving community including many people at your level of expertise so you be mocked for being a am a professional software developer with over 25 years experience and currently mainly working in and a bit of for apps such as you realbasic is my tool of i believe someone downvoted this but have the guts to add a comment explaining heard about prejudice against realbasic but this is the first time encountered in what way was my answer inappropriate for this to add to my used by systems deployed to tens of thousands of end users i have the experience to applaud someone else doing a good job and the realbasic frameworks are very

of all smells like of you also wanted to know the i did my best to explain it human i think recursion is most of the times very you only have to grasp 2 steps first step the other steps with the same short the permutation of 1 element is one the permutation of a set of elements is a list each of the concatenated with every permutation of the other the set just has one element return the set has two characters each element in it return element with the permutation of rest of the elements like so for each characte in set return concatenated with perumation of the rest of the set b i found on if permutation required for min digit to max if not in else add permutation to and something more elaborate since it is tagged c from but i decided to copy it so the post is not dependent on the function takes a string of and writes down every possible permutation of that exact so for if has been should spill class private void swap char ref char public void int private void go int int int if for i swap go swap class static void permute p new string char the

of the autotools are not an opaque build system but a loosely coupled as tinkertim already pointed let me just add some thoughts on autoconf and is the configuration system that creates the configure script based on feature checks that are supposed to work on all kinds of a lot of system knowledge has gone into its macro database during the 15 years of its on the one i think the latter is the main reason autotools have not been replaced by something else on the other autoconf used to be far more important when the target platforms were more heterogeneous and and a large variety of different processor architecture had to be i really see its point if you only want to support recent linux distributions and is an abstraction layer for gnu make and acts as a makefile generator from simpler a number of projects eventually got rid of the automake abstraction and reverted to writing makefiles manually because you lose control over your makefiles and you might not need all the canned build targets that obfuscate your to the i strongly suggest an alternative to autotools based on your most notable achievement is replacing autotools in probably the closest you can get if you want to have functionality without m4 it brings windows support to the table and has proven to be applicable in large my beef with cmake is that it is still a least on with all its immanent problems makefile timestamp implicit dependency is a make replacement written in it uses python scripts as build control files allowing very sophisticated its configuration system is not on par with scons is often used for development when adaptation to specific requirements is more important than following you really want to stick with i strongly suggest to read make considered and write your own gnu makefile configured through

of the point opposed it is illegal to convert a to a const for reasons explained your main problem is that the test you are expecting to fail when reached the empty string at the end of the animals is that statement is actually checking if the pointer which points to the string is not checking if the string is an empty string string containing the single character is not the same as a null other once reached the last element of the animals evaluates to a pointer which happens to point to a string that is therefore the test and your loop continues forever it continues until you run far enough past the end of the animals array that it causes a can fix this either by replacing with null when you create the animals or you can change the while check to check 0 any other way of checking for an empty string instead of a null note that others pointed out equally serious problems that i

of you are rightfully concerned because circular dependencies between packages are problems that come out of it grow in importance with the size of the but no reason to tackle this situation on should organize your classes by placing classes that you reuse together in the same if you have for example abstractneuron and place them in the same if you now have implementations humanneuron and place these in the same package for example you might have only one type of for example baseconnection and many different the principle stays the you place baseconnection together with humanneuron in its own package together with humansignal virtualneuron together with virtualsignal a connection a neuron so it be in the this is not that nor correct to be say you placed all your neurons in the same neither this is unless you reuse all your implementations take a look at scheme i described either your project is so small you place all in the single or you start organizing packages as more details take a look at common reuse classes in a package are reused if one of the classes in a you reuse	
of you who use ff3 may be familiar with an interesting new attribute of the address it allows you to do in order to filter through urls that you have viewed if you want to open the following can simply type any of that url that are sufficient to uniquely distinguish the changes the way users can think about because now all they have to remember are the keywords that will help narrow down the potential this feature is but there is a users have a decreased incentive to bookmark and memorize this obviously becomes a problem if a user needs to type in a url at a remote site example during a sales and they fumble around because they cannot remember the url of the snazzy product catalogue that they want to show during a there are ways around this bookmark your urls and copy your bookmarks to your laptop before you go on a use a solution or online bookmarking social bookmarking sites and so question for those users who do not want to use any of the above is there actually a way to dig into the ff3 internals so i can write a script that will extract the components necessary to replicate a users behavior on any 3 address bar

on published by google engineers henry shumeet and yushi it seems the most important implication of your question about recognizing colors in images relates to algorithm for pictures that can detect without any text around paper begins by describing by describing the which are typically based on normalizing color brightness and then using a or using a histogram built up using the rgb values in pixels color is a 8bit integer value from representing how much of that color is included in the methods have also been introduced that rely on properties such as incorrectly called which is the density of luminous intensity to the naked eye from a given google paper mentions that they will need to process roughly images with their algorithm so it needs to be as efficient as to achieve they perform the majority of their calculations on an roi of which is a rectangle centered in the image and inset by of the image dimensions on all once determined the they have many different algorithms that are then applied to the image including color constancy and which as a whole find in the coloring and most importantly the color shades with the highest frequency in the statistical use other features such as entropy and to order to extract lines from the they use the opencv implementation of the probabilistic hough transform et computed on the edges of the skin color connected which allows to find straight which are probably not body parts and additionally allows them to better determine which colors are most important in an which is a key factor in their image color more on the technicalities of this topic including the math equations and read the google paper linked to in the beginning and look at the research section of their web interesting question and

one of the main things you can do in a dvcs like git that work well in svn is the create several development branches off of trunk for various features that are under merge code from one feature branch into another feature branch before either feature branch is finished and ready to be merged into merge the feature branches into nice to break new features off into separate branches so that trunk stays clean until the features are inevitably you run into a situation where a team working on one feature branch has written some code that is needed by a team on another feature if you merge this code across feature branches with have trouble merging into trunk later git avoids this another your company decides to outsource development of a feature to an indian contracting your professional services group needs to add a feature for a and that feature may be productized in the you really want to give write access to your svn to the indian contractor or your ps they have to build the code outside of source and you have to merge it in detecting and resolving any conflicts yourself without any help from and losing all of the history in the with you just give the contractor or your ps group a copy of the and they can commit to it just like a you can use features to merge the changes back into your git git will find the and it will preserve one of the coolest things about git is that you really have to convince your friend that better than because git integrates so well with your can happily use svn while you happily use a git connected to the

people here are probably familiar with one of most popular blog may i have a where he cries out for a way to remove dependencies on the framework so a application can be developed and of the visual studio development at the replied his views on the arguing that the topic is somewhat moot the ability to fix security problems in the runtime other was their chief the small overhead was worth forward to a few groups out there now claiming to have zander even said himself that it take much to implement instead of the meg download of we now have a massive mb complete installer that contains versions of for and suggestions to decrease the runtime size the remove the target platforms you and put it back the web bootstrapper that only downloads the libraries for your the client profile installer as of late which has limited libraries and only works for make matters as i understand it correct me if the client profile even register with windows as having this means if multiple client applications are installed on the none will see each other and the runtime will be again and really know what microsoft is thinking even assuming the worst case install will be for one target platform and only those libraries need to be still looking at upwards of 60 mb overhead on your even one of the most well known was fraught with installing the application because of the massive if they have problems distributing a free what about the rest of the in the they had to a bootstrapper that installed microsoft installer the runtime and all their other dependent before they could install their own how about a do any good ones exist or a tool that simply makes it possible to build a application without requiring that the user install the massive it looks like a couple of has its own from the answer it looks like it works pretty seems to be one available and is another that was and by another linker by they bill it as an any thoughts another by rustemsoft called skater anyone familiar with by microsoft was also this looks like it only performs part of the task merging not stripping out unused looks like the mono tools are getting how about the based any other experience with or are we just going to have to wait for microsoft to push it out to i shudder to think how long take for to be put state of linkers for apps may i have a 2009

performance the switch case is is the results show that the switch statement is faster to execute than the this is due to the ability to optimise the switch in the case of the the code must process each if statement in the order determined by the because each case within a switch statement does not rely on earlier the compiler is able to the testing in such a way as to provide the fastest	
performing a query where the attributes selected make up the components of an index does that result in a faster i would imagine that the query could see that the requested columns could be satisfied completely by the index table bigint not null default bigint not bigint not primary key index on table add foreign key references on delete table add foreign key references on delete storyid from liked where userid the query above there any data external to what is already contained in the index so i would imagine there would be less actions if the query optimizer could infer that the resulting tuples could be satisfied by the index selecting only indexed attributes result in faster

perhaps the best real world example in consider the lists implemented in this where the list chaining aspect is backed directly into the type rather than as a separate can be extremely powerful and they come however with a variety of trade obvious one is code you must bake this logic in each techniques such as extending a base class providing the pointer are messy lose strong typing without and often unacceptable from a performance point of is that you are limited to one implementation per you cannot make a singly linked structure into a doubly linked one without inserting an extra field in every instance and updating all the relevant

probleam is that when you are using you can use only subclasses as a snippet from a implements page that uses these field editors display and store the values on the instead creating swt controls to fill a subclass creates field editors display the of fields on the page must be as field means you have two options how to achieve what you your own subclass of which would represent the group not extend but only a than you have to implement method instead of you will also have to manage loading and saving of the but i think this way might be easier if you want to provide some complex may find some information more	
problem encountered with is that because by default you do a full test run a test or a suite of test for each mutation way to make mutation testing faster would be to stop the test run for a given mutant once a single failure has been encountered only during mutation even better would be for the mutation tester to remember what was the first test to kill the last and give that first to the next is there anything in ruby that does either of these or is my best bet to start monkey i know unit tests ought to be and showing all of the failed tests is useful outside of mutation as it helps you not merely identify that but pinpoint where going currently using heckle with if not possible for to remember which tests fail between maybe heckle or something running heckle could remember unit tests fail quickly for mutation

problem is that the conversion tools offer support for the vb6 graphics commands or the vb6 printer plus you get into a lot of corner cases when dealing with activex i know our own applications translate over with any conversion tools as a lot of tweaks are built into the ui to make it work smoothly with the vb6 form are things that conversion tools fail on as the winform engine requires own the same thing was experienced when our software moved from dos to sometimes there is no substitution for manual that being there are somethings you can do to make conversion considerably first make sure your application is built in this way you can convert one layer at a test and continue it also has the advantage of leaving you with usable software at every i recommend starting at the top layer and working your way sure anything that is vb6 centric and not basic centric is behind an when first came out several years ago i created a canvas interface and implemented that using the vb6 graphics i use the same canvas interface in except now it uses the graphics the same was done for all the code was moved out of our forms into classes that the forms the forms themselves implement an interface that the ui classes when we switched to we have a precise definition of how the form interacted with the rest of the system and form conversion was considerably of these steps where done in vb6 and put through our normal release then afterward we started the

reason for disliking properties is because they look like fields so developers who understand the difference will treat them as if assuming that be cheap to execute i disagree with him on this particular point i find properties make the client code much simpler to read than the equivalent method i agree that developers need to know that properties are basically methods in disguise but i think that educating developers about that is better than making code harder to read using having seen java code with several getters and setters being called in the same i know that the equivalent code would be a lot simpler to the law of demeter is all very well in but sometimes really is the right thing to automatically implemented properties really change any of is slightly like the arguments against using extension methods i can understand the but the practical benefit used outweighs the downside in my

requires some language support compilers would do it it requires that the compiler generates which expose metadata that other modules can reference to call into assemblies are a straightforward all the files in a project are compiled generating one this dll can be queried by to determine which types it so that other assemblies can call functions defined in to make use of it must be legal in the language to reference other what defines the boundary of a the language specifies that the compiler only considers data in its current compilation unit file included there is no mechanism for specifying like to call function foo in module even though i have the prototype or anything for it at the only mechanism you have for sharing type information between files is with is a proposal to add a module system to but it be in last i the plan was to consider it for a tr1 after 0x is worth mentioning that the system in was originally used because back in the it allowed the compiler to process the code in a simple linear it have to build syntax trees or other such the tables have turned and become a huge both in terms of usability and compilation

say i am tasked with coding some kind of an this means for want to track a and stats like damage bonuses or positively scared that by the end of the project i may end up with handling with very a high number of fields and for each i would have to make sure they follow a very similar set of constraint and behaviours i want them to be bounded between a min and a i want to be able to distinguish between a and a i want to be able to increment and decrement both without going through a setters and for every field i would need one getter and four setters and maybe a couple resetters even for 10 fields that means a lot of methods all dryness i have started encapsulating the logic of messing with those stats in so that i could write code such as or takes care the value returned is in i have even gone to such a length to create classes to group those fields but not the point right i hit in this problem while into most java textbooks say that each class should have private fields with public getters and that sounds good in and already built a whole class around an the idea sound as solid when you find yourself calling a getter to a much rather access the field maybe my but for me it is clearer and more problem with public fields is that giving up all control on for example at some other point in the by the following might like a subtle i should i really worry about i for one never plan to assign the directly i have documented in the javadoc that this is not something that should be but still i am new here so a bit i would like to hear what your take on this are the advantages of encapsulation so massive that i should go ahead and have getter getters and setter getters and so or should i take encapsulation in healthy measures and leave the as a i been trying to but just recently seen also a bit of and properties oh except in and a getter save me from a faulty how to handle a lot of fields and their encapsulation

short and simple answer if you adjust the base testclass no way you can modify the class to replace a method by once we started doing stuff like be in a completely different kind of like longer answer it depends on who is calling the replaced other see if you implement a in between them and the unmodifiable concrete whether this is doable depends on whether that class implements or is its own the class then your only option is to decompile and modify the at design time using equivalent or at runtime using have to be hurting pretty badly to go this as sure to be painful and you still explained what you are trying do and replacing methods on the go is powerful stuff in the languages that permit it there might be mocking libraries that can be twisted sufficiently far to do the reflection but then be skating on thin	
short answer start by becoming an active user of the it will make it long answer problem that open source projects want help most would be happy to have all of the help they can the problem is that most people who decide to help stick around just long enough to take some time away from the development then and never show up have been very active in a couple of open source projects in the and we ran into this all of the it was very easy to get people to want to but very hard to get them to actually put the effort required into the project in order to be i personally spent many hours trying to help out new prospective and nearly always ended up just watching them team will be much more responsive if you can prove that serious and it usually takes more than just showing up in a chat or on a mailing start by finding the right easy to find open source but more difficult to find the one the right fit for is the or the easy depending on your point of recommend starting with a project that you are familiar with and hopefully one if you find one interested try using the software in its current state before you even think about trying to join the development if you are a user of the more likely that be interested in contributing over the project will do two things it will familiarize you with how they are thinking about the this will often make it easier to understand the design of the but most help you understand the goals of the current also often easier to get the ear of a if you have specific questions to i personally am always very responsive to a intelligent this helps build a relationship with the current development become familiar with the team and the project and have some idea of try to fix one or two of the this is an easy way to show that you can be productive and and will be received fairly that the team will probably be much more receptive to helping you find longer term goals and tasks on which to had a couple of people who approached our projects more along these and all been very happy to help them try to figure out how to fit in and mesh with the team as the goal you want to just be a contributor in the long want to be part of the when you start feeling ownership over the and when it really gets	
short michael working effectively with legacy longer biggest challenge when maintaining such an application is doing it without breaking this means you need to understand the behaviour of the and the easiest way to do this is to get tests around as this can be daunting at but it is not it requires discipline and have to start with unit usually easier to get an automation such as nunitforms or to drive the application as a black box build up a suite of tests around the area you need to change to give you enough confidence to change it without breaking then go in and start refactoring towards unit anything like the application working it mainly unused code a public static method calls and replacing them with interfaces injection is a key technique duplicated code into file network and user interface code behind adapters can be very thin wrappers at just enough so that you can replace them with stubs when for opportunities to extract behaviour into small it will be easier to rewrite sections of the code rather than refactor but that requires an understanding of the either through testing or by referring to a spec one from any practical if part of a team working on this make sure you are it will make the work more enjoyable and ensure that changes you make today undone tomorrow by someone who understand what you were working could write all day on this but mr feathers is much better at and good

so if i understand all of the hardware is done your system has a command input that is a current level in amperes by say a double precision floating point number in and the output of the controller is a voltage that controls hardware that draws your plant is the circuit and the feedback is probably an 10 or 16 bit number either signed or unsigned depending on your your system looks like quickest and dirtiest approach is probably pid you can brush up on the basics with wikipedia and there are some hints on implementation in this a nutshell you want to compute the error of the system which in your example is the current command current make sure everything is in the same hopefully after your error is calculated you have to correct it with a in your system that is the voltage command to your current with the command is calculated by multiplying the the integral of the and the derivative of the error by gains and summing the the gains are the tricky the other tricky parts making sure your units are making sure the timing is and the correct your system you have many error is the command is which turns into then the current use is amps which is reported as volts which gets turned into either a signed or unsigned integer which has to be scaled back into amperes to make the error have lots of make sure you can keep track of what physical unit applies to control algorithm is hard and has to run at a dedicated i would recommend at least 100hz every electronic circuits move quickly not like electromechanical you may need a higher rate to stay on top of but it has to be hard real time that means you may not even be able to get away with software and derivative calculations are tricky but there are only so many ways to do the most basic algorithm is the rectangle rule dumb but it will probably if you need to be more precise use trapezoidal check the algorithms out most likely you use derivative control it tends to make things unstable and needed in most you ought to be fine with are lots of pitfalls but this should get you if had a background in control theory then it should all come back to once the framework is in place spend a lot of time tuning the proportional and integral gains the meat of the if this still seems like too much math for sorry this is about as simple as it gets for

solution should be pretty and require axis of rotation to get from normal1 to normal2 must be orthogonal to so just take their amount of rotation is easily derived from their this value is but as the two normal vectors should be normalised it will give so just take the inverse cosine to get the rotation resulting vector and angle are the required parameters for no need to calculate the actual rotation matrix forget that needs the angle in but the normal c trig functions work in

the case where you have a virtual method on a sealed and the type of the object reference is the sealed class the virtual call could be take the following there is no actual reason that getname needs to be called virtually because we know there can be no sub class of parent and hence no further virtual class parent child public override string return void var p new var name compiler could choose to notice this and output a call il instruction instead of a however both the and compiler choose not to perform this both will emit jit is also free to make such an it also chooses not does not mean however that you should not seal your classes should be sealed unless you actually intend for someone to inherit from otherwise opening yourself up to scenarios you have failed to accurately nothing stopping the compilers and jit from implementing this at a later

the easiest thing to do is just create a simple data class with a bunch of public and so you can select your data into that if you are dealing with nullable types that will be pretty clear when you consume the though if it is all strings you might find something else cleaner when it comes time to consume the simple class mydata string bar baz foo from f in where 5 select new mydata bar foo can also separate your statements out like this if you want to have the select in a different place than the select this will only hit the server when you try to enumerate foo from f in where 5 select foodata mydata

the end side effects are what you want to effects are natural for code that interacts with outside make many algorithms avoid using side you need to implement loops by thus your language implementation needs tail call code is easy to effects can make code code is easier to prove example at first it seems very but then you need to start playing with outside world and not so much fun moves state as a function parameter and hides it into things called which enable you to write in imperative	
the example above probably indicates that something goes notimplementedexception itself is not wrong all about the contract of superclass and about subclass implementing this if your superclass has such this method is optional and may be not if not supported it should throw notimplementedexception to find out if it is supported or use void int not supporting this method is still ok with the if it is not you probably should disable corresponding action in so if you are ok with such then subclass implements it option when client explicitly declares that it does not use all class methods and is never going like this method never modifies it just iterates over them and gets elements by we decided to be not very bureaucratic and not define readonlylist and this is 3rd party library so you can not modify it void it is ok to pass there implementaion of list that does not support and other just document use with care this implementation does not implement entire list it does not support methods that modify the content of the readonlylistimpl implements having your code to define all your contract is as it your compiler to check if you violate the sometimes it is not reasonable and you have to resort to weakly defined like short words it comes to the if you really can safely use your subclass as taking into account that superclass is defined by its contract which is not only

the format is recognizable as your why you identified the code that is generating this string if several try adding unique data to figure out which code path is the fact that the arrays are interleaved with large freed items leads me to guess that they were originally paired or at least try to identify the freed objects to figure out what was generating them and the associated you identify what is generating these try to figure out what would be keeping them from being perhaps being stuffed in a forgotten or unused list for logging purposes or something the memory region and the specific array size for the just figure out what is being done with these strings to cause a try the when your program has created or manipulated these strings just once or when fewer objects to

the gcc file formats do not support arbitrary sections so the section attribute is not available on all if you need to map the entire contents of a module to a particular consider using the facilities of the linker linux uses a flat memory so you gain anything by things into a single do i suppose you could make an asm function to reserve the space and then do pointer foo to get might want to wrap the ugly in a thought would be to split the problem in write a small example case of the closest thing you can and still get the asm and tinker with it to see what you can get past the downstream if nothing you could write something to mungle the asm code for that entomb it in you make and call it another try putting the variable definitions in a small asm module as or whatever with the right section and let the linker handle

the issue was caused by incorrect use of as sure the following example is pretty much pseudo so wont added a 3rd solution thanks to wrong way stack mytype1 mytype1 mt1 this actually does print so the memory is being because using stack memory this value is when we go back to thread mytype1 mt1 this will actually print out where is correct method heap also the simple method which uses stack use heap memory so the memory stays mytype1 new get a pointer to the we use stack here because the values assigned would be lost as soon as we try and access them from mytype1 as this prints because assigning to memory on the this stay assigned until the entire application not sure if using heap memory here is but it anwyay just to play on the safe let me know if is mytype1 this prints correct method stack memory to nusi for mytype1 using the before the variable turns it into a instead of using stack we use the original is this explanation mytype1 this actually does print so the memory is being assigning to the so this mytype1 mt1 prints as

the past six been using nhibernate with active record at and lightspeed at home in my spare found both lightspeed and nhibernate with active record to be straightforward to found drawbacks with lightspeed the features i like most over this saves a lot of time and provides consistent model class and config for linq and mysql features i like most about active record xml configuration the most common configuration options are provided flexibility is still available when required criteria drawbacks of active record for me appear to be more ruby on rails code examples than compared both products side by side and run performance tests on both would guess that nhibernate suffers from a deeper class while optimising my code using ants i found that for a simple query there is call after call through nhibernate classes before the actual sql query is the query that is produced that will make all the difference to the ultimate performance of the lightspeed and nhibernate offer lazy and active record makes this easy for think it is easier to optimise your queries using lightspeed with and more clear to people maintaining your whereas not usually recommended to write nhibernate

the students know coming into the course or are you teaching it to if they still need to learn html then this will limit what you can teach during the course of the it is imperative that they have a comfortable and accurate understanding of there is a solid foundation of html then the concepts that are taught in accessibility and standards will come much make sure you stress that html is used to describe the content not to design a the job of order to teach you should assign pick out a few some tutorial site or any place on the web where there is an intelligent discussion of web this will push the students to think about the principles of web design while learning the this will also show them the resources to learn on their of the skills that is rarely taught in classes least in my is how to learn something on your with web design and web development this skill is extraordinarily so teach them how to where to go when google fails and then places to ask i would say get rid of the book and make the class resources entire the students need to buy a the material would be much more up to date and they learn skills that they can use once the class is hope this helps because i would love to see a change in the way that web design is i am in a university and have taken a couple of disappointing web design if you would like me to expand on any of the just let me

thing that uuids buy you that is very difficult to do otherwise is to get a unique identifier having to consult or coordinate with a central the general problem of being able to get such a thing without some sort of managed infrastructure is the problem the uuids read that according to the birthday paradox the chance of a uuid collision occuring is once uuids have been now is a pretty big but a chance of collision seems far too risky how many uuids need to exist before a chance of collision even that seems like too large of a problem with that analysis is are not entirely random there are major components of the uuid that are time so to have any real chance at a the colliding uuids need tobe generated at the exact same time from different uuid say that while there is a reasonable chance that several might be generated at the same enough other gunk location info or random to make the likeyhood of a collision between this very small set of uuids nearly uuids only need to be unique among the set of other uuids that they might be compared if generating a uuid to use as a database it matter if somewhere else in an evil alternate universe that the same uuid is being used to identify a com just like cause no confusion if someone else named on

thing to note about answer with multiple in one can be rather dangerous for really large amounts of because most dbms have an upper limit on the size of the commands they can if you exceed that with too many your insert will on mysql for example the limit is usually 1mb you should figure out what the maximum size is at might be available from the database and make sure you exceed it by spreading your lists of values over several	
thing yet to be considered is versions of visualstudio prior to 2005 did not allow exe assembly projects to be referenced from other so if you are working on a legacy project in your options would unit tests in the same project and use conditional compilation to exclude them from release everything to dll assemblies so your exe is just an entry the ide by hacking the project file in a text the three conditional compilation is the least error	
things have already been but i think one should also that there are some programming that differ from oop and for those tuples are quite programming languages like haskell for example have classes at	
think a good guideline is to comment every class and method with a general description of what each is especially if you are using an html documentation generation other than i try to keep comments to a minimum only comment code that could potentially be or require interpretation of try to write your code in a way that require think there is really a metric that you can apply to of it just depends on the

think one of the problems that having is that you are somewhere between not giving you enough knobs and but the problem complicated enough for you to write something more this reach for something like it more event driven so it can walk across your xml and give you control when you want once you get the element you you can do whatever you like with things like various things like xpath and so on can be useful in the same they are built to look deep into xml to pull out parts of unlike which just gives you a data d

think that referencing when is since wpf is still a relatively new it just have complete feature parity with winforms for to my knowledge none of the standard windows dialogs save browse for have been implemented in wpf the only way to display these in a wpf application is to use the winforms or use to display the win32 versions i go with the winforms version since they already took the trouble of wrapping the win32 approach is to use wpf as much as and only fallback to winforms if wpf fill my hopefully over the next release or so of wpf this will become less and less	
think that the programmer has to just start doing a few simple tests to start with are easy to justify as part of like a unit test is almost always necessary to get fast debugging turn just explain how much faster it is to launch the test than it is to arrange the correct set a debugger launch the the test in your just put a comment explaining where the test is and how to run future programmers will see it and hopefully the testing will

think the ideal solution would be to have the data layer throw a specific exception in this perhaps a subclass of sqlexception for or something you want to be able to treat different exceptions then you have to throw different exception types to begin think this is an area where the spring framework gets things really they provide very rich hierarchy of all of which extend with of types for integrity etc this leaves your client code free to catch any of the exception types which it can handle or care exceptions that indicate an error that may not be repeatable if you the a fatal or you can simply catch the root	
think there is a simple way to wrap a mutable data structure as an immutable immutable data structures become efficient when the new version can share data with the old version in clever and i really see how this can be done without access to the internals of you really want a persistent priority queue might be those seems to have inserts so if that is an issue maybe you have to look for another on second a simple implementation of a persistent priority queue is just to store the in a sorted something like x pq pq the code above is pretty limited multiple for but it illustrates the

think to answer this question we would need to know about the architecture of your entire program or whatever the case may answer it there are a number of strategies you can others have pointed on a modern desktop or server operating you can and not worry about the memory your program has strategy for if you are developing on an embedded operating system where might not clean everything typically what i see is when individual functions return due to an they make sure to clean up anything they themselves have you see any calls after 10 each function would in turn indicate an error when it and each function would clean up after the original function you will it might not be called would detect the clean up any memory it had and take the appropriate you just have not rocket where it gets difficult is if you have multiple threads of and shared data then you might need a garbage collector or a way to count references and free the memory when the last user of the structure is done with for if you look at the source to the bsd networking see that it uses a value in some structures that need to be kept for an extended period of time and shared among different is basically what garbage collectors as	
think what you are doing is quite such little things as changes in displaying could and should be undertaken by example i have a main menu rendered by a separate there are lots of such little checks inside in order to decide what text to show and which styles to apply to list there are big decisions like thinking of what view to render based on some user action then the controller questions the business logic and decides what view to return of where to but if it is a quite stable ui element where only text and color options are slightly changed then put the necessary logic into could also pass a separate model to your ascx with several flags defining what and how should be then the actual logic to set those flags will be somewhere else on the business logic level and all your view will do is just look at those flags and render doing it

think you should share your profile in a brief to get a better hibernate and spring are hot and you will find them in all job requirements posted for enterprise so you are on the right track as far as your selection choices is hibernate is trickier than reason for that spring by virtue of its architecture is least invasive to the is little api to to code in you have to really code anything beyond to code you need to know the hibernate apis and the gotchas of hibernate the basics of hibernate are easy to but to learn the tricks and it takes i was the hiring manager and were using hibnernate and would rather take someone who was stronger on hibernate rather than someone who was stronger on far as spring is you as a contributing will have little to worry likely the application will already have a framework in and you will have to plug in your contributions to code in like i said its better if you have soem experience on i know everyone has a different viewpoint on so you maybe getting more confused once you share a bit of your it will help people give you a better good luck

this is an someone logs a bug at microsoft complaining that their finalizers running when some nasty code makes the process exit so that problem gets then someone else logs a bug about how there seem to be a way to force the process to exit instantly so that finalizers so microsoft adds a new api to allow that so another person demands a new kind of finalizer that always runs even in response to that new kind of and so it would probably be easier to change the code than to try and rely on who is currently winning the arms

using views in drupal the answer is yes with some important normal forms in exposed filter values come in as params raher than that means that you can populate an exposed filter just by appending to the current kicker is that if multiple views on the same page are looking for the same filter keys in the they will both use the incoming filter need to configure each list of exposed filters to make sure that they all user the same list of with the same list of for the incoming if you want the filter form to only appear you may have to do some crafty juggling as will want it to appear on each view by but an option on each view to move its exposed filters to a doing that and not enabling the exposed filter block effectively hides the exposed filter while keeping the filtering active if it comes in via the make sure all four views have the same list of exposed and are using the same for the hide the exposed filter widgets on all but one of the at that it should

work tried a pilot project to migrate historical data from an erp the size of the data is on the small only covering over 21 million the largest table having 16 million an additional million rows waiting to come into the pipe but the pilot has been shelved due to other the plan was to use facility to schedule queries that would regenerate data on a daily basis suitable for use in simple aggregates over the large record the first thing i noticed is how sensitive it is to the amount of ram an increase in ram at one point allowed for a worth of aggregates without resorting to sequential table you decide to use i would highly recommend the config as it tends to ship with the most conservative settings possible that it will run on systems with little tuning takes a little maybe a few but once you get it to a point where response is just set it and forget you have the tuning done all about turn your attention to your indexing and query planning also requires a little effort but once set find it to be partial indexes are a nice feature for isolating those records that have data in i highly recommend this feature if you are looking for exceptions in a sea of similar use the table space feature to relocate the data onto a fast drive

would seem that regular expression questions are common as each question seems to apply to a specific with that here is my specific need to validate that an employee id is in one of two specific the first format one that i have working is the where can be any alphabet character and can be any number between 0 and the other requirement for this is that only the first two positions of the employee id are meaning that a user can enter and it would validate employee id gets used in a sql like like this i have by second format is the one giving me the same requirement holds above where only the first two positions of the input string are anything else is but if entered it must adhere to the specified the format is the the part i am having trouble with is making sure that if more than two digits are that the next three to six values entered are and if the last value is then it must be a so valid inputs could or or or or or but not or or or or here is what i have so far for this problem is that this allows to be entered anywhere in positions three through it will not allow any in the first two positions and it will not allow any numeric characters in the seventh position its just those optional third through sixth characters allowing that is causing me hope this is enough info perhaps not too any help would be greatly thank expression validation in

would suggest two interfaces and dependency as a way to decouple your interfaces give you a way to define a contract or set of expected behaviors that is independent of any when you have a class depend on an interface rather than on a you get the freedom to substitute other classes that implement the interface without having to rewrite the class that is depending on you use interfaces with dependency give the class the actual implementation that it is to work on rather than have it create a particular implementation on its you achieve even more decoupling in your now the class only knows about the interface and even know how to create just use dependency injection is often used with creational patterns such as builder or where you localize the construction of objects in a single class so that only that class need change when you extend the application with additional remember that coupling its is a relative you eliminate all coupling or your objects be able to having some level of dependence is you need to balance it with ease of use and implementation as for your particular hard to tell without actual i suspect that you are the solution and violating the dry principle repeat you may need to look at ways to use interfaces and perhaps a lightweight wrapper to decouple your classes from the framework component rather than a complete

writing a program that implements the identity based for the actual encryption i use blowfish which i got from trying to adapt the blowfish code to my the difference in my program is that i read the message from the standard encrypt it and print the then decrypt it and print the decryption should be the original i read the input message up to a character and then try to follow the code from the the decryption is printed as unreadable i tried to solve this problem but i got can you please help key of the blowfish plaintext of the ciphertext of the message hold the byte of the to tokens of the initialization offset offset of of bytes in of input msg from the to read input in a loop with to calculate lengths different for the setup to read input in a loop with the index read enter the message you wish to this is my code to read the input loop reads the input from the user since c does not a safe function to read strings with white include the delim character in the the string by the null then i used the code and for encryption course i modified it as message read from stdin not program the input message to up the shared key of the bf the block of 8 characters each there is still more offset the next block of 8 cipher is correctly then i used the code and for decryption i excluded the part where it tokenized the cipher and created the plain char array for i simply passed the cipher array to be decrypted it is output from the encryption and stored in the plain char array with length up the shared key of the bf after is the i get unreadable characters as output of this help is sorry for the inconvenience and many thanks in problem with the blowfish encryption in

writing a simple custom control and banging my head against the wall trying to figure out how to implement what seems like a my custom is supposed to work similarly to the list in windows that it displays a list of items as but when the user selects an item in the a clickable button should appear next to the item in my trying to display an button next to each item in my order to keep the custom somewhat trying to display the button by overriding the method the button is conceptually part of the list box but i get it to work quite should note that trying to use a single button for the entire when the user selects a item in the the method just this single button so that it appears next to the selected i have it the problem now is that when the is scrolled and the selected item goes the button is still drawn to its previous so it draws on top of the wrong guessing this is because windows try to redraw the selected item if it is and thus the repositioning code get is version of what i have right partial class eventlistbox private button public set up the button that will appear next to the new add the button as a child control of this protected override void if draw item here if drawing the selected the button so that inside the current and make it visible if it is these checks prevent the resulting repaint that will occur from causing an infinite the problem seems to be that if the listbox is scrolled such that the selected moves this code because it repaint the selected item this means the button will be painted in its previous the real question is there a better way to approach the whole notion rendering buttons within listbox if protected override void for for using a single would rather create a separate button for each item in the but i find any way to track when items are from the i find any relevant methods that i could and i the property to a custom collection since is because of i went with the above approach of using a single button and it as but as i this very robust and breaks current thinking is it would make the most sense to create a new button at the point when new items are added to the and remove buttons when items were are some possible solutions i came up but is there a better way to implement could just create my own methods directly derived i could create a each time a new item is remove the button to this ugly because it forces me these special of just could draw a new button manually in using but then i have to do a lot of extra work to make it act like a real since is doing nothing more than drawing the figuring out when the user hovers over this and when it is seems like it would be difficult to get is i could create a new button if the item being drawn already have a button associated with it could keep track of this with a but i still need a way to remove unused buttons when their corresponding items are removed from the i guess i could iterate over my dictionary of mappings and remove items that exist in the but then iterating over two lists every time an item in the is redrawn is there a better way to include clickable buttons inside a obviously been done but i find anything useful on the only examples seen that have buttons in a were wpf but looking for how to do this with is the best way to draw controls as within each item in a winforms

you go for mutability then you will find that whenever you need to call a method that you want to have the object or you need to return an object that is part of the internal you need to make a defensive you really look at programs that make use of mutible objects you will find that they are prone to by passed to passed to returned from issue show up very often because most programs change the data are in reality immutable by virtue of them never personally make every thing i possibly can i probably have of all variables marked as there are some cases where it has to be but the vast majority of cases it does think it might depend on your if you are writing libraries for 3rd parties to use you think about this much more than if you are writing an application that only you your will find that you can write large scale applications using immutable objects for the majority of the system without too much	
you grep you get to see any if then the library is without the support if you do see the mechanism outlined should if it you probably have a reportable level are you trying to trace the since unixodbc why not use the driver manager that does taken the example from and compiled it on solaris 10 using csdk i got it to the point where the connection but the table is missing in the database so the program stops when i run it under of on then i see no evidence of the code even trying to open the trace compiled used the following data ids stores on ibm informix cli this data ids stores on ibm informix cli i believe you have found a not sure whether the bug is in the faq you referenced or in the product inclined to think the you should report the issue to ibm technical not checked the informix cli it might be worth checking that before trying to file a product if the manual indicates that trace and perhaps if it indicate that it does then there is a bug in the faq page you you are looking to see the sql the sqlidebug part of the faq generated a file for me it will be different for you can then use the utility to see the data flowing between client and you cannot find get back to

you have a set of elements when the page edit maybe you have something like this with do return what if you add a new element to this table after the page has initially you click on on this new nothing will happen because the events were bound on page enter with you can bind the event above like do return if you add any new elements with a class of after the page has initially it will still register this event how is this uses what is known as event delegation to achieve this event delegation is helpful in this situation or when you want to load a large amount of say you have a div with instead of 4 you have or or you want to bind a click event to images so that x action is performed when the user clicks on doing it as you might do then bind hundreds of handlers that all do the same this is inefficient and can result in slow performance in heavy with event even if you plan on adding more images using live can be much better for this kind of as you can then bind handler to the container and check when it is clicked if the target was an and then perform an to achieve the effect without with jquery knows that new elements can be added later on or that performance is instead of binding an event to the actual it might add one to the div like in the first example pretty sure it binds them to the body but it might to the container in the example and then this property can let it check after the fact if the event that was on matches the selector that you might have make it this is helpful not only in the direct way of not having to rebind but it can be dramatically faster for a large amount of

you may want to start looking into the php 5 exception remember though that just because something is new mean that you must adopt only adopt those features that you need and make sense in your being i feel that exceptions are a good concept to grasp and even if you decide not to adopt them you will be all the better for the would like to suggest that you read exceptions 5 has an exception model to that of other an exception can be and caught within code may be surrounded in a try to facilitate the catching potential each try have at least one corresponding multiple catch blocks can used to catch different classes normal execution exception is thrown within the or when a catch matching thrown class is will continue after that catch block defined in exceptions can be thrown within a catch would also encourage you to read is an this is a java tutorial but the concepts are an error occurs within a the method creates an object and hands it off to the runtime the called an exception contains information about the including its type and the state of the program when the error creating an exception object and handing it to the runtime system is called throwing an in order to implement a global exception handler in order to establish a default exception handler that will handle previously unhandled you will want to us the

you using any of the advanced features of jboss and you planning then probably better to go with a pure embedded this if a security fix is found in you can upgrade just the one single embedded component and move jboss is significantly larger and is thus more difficult to all you are using from jboss is jms or jndi or something else that is easily embeddable as a separate 3rd party component in then by all means drop jboss and move to just an embedded should you stick with when using jboss makes your life so much easier that the extra work of upgrading jboss is worth the this is true for many it sounds like it is not true in your far as integrating better with i expect that both integrate pretty well with i use which supports both jboss and so this may depend on what version of eclipse and what plugins you are

your example you suggested one service for articles and one service for that may of course be just an but in that case it would not make sense to separate because it would be quite likely and common to have queries routines which make use of both category data and article that in it usually makes the most sense to group routines by the degree to which they are related to one if you can separate all your possible routines three clean groups with little to no then it makes sense to have three if you cannot cleanly separate any of your you should limit yourself to one web regarding your statement being a downside of one web service that necessarily you can always create layers of abstraction the web so that the service class itself is simply a facade with many thin method calls that reach into bulkier logic the the only approach which truly matters because the only approach which works is the simplest approach build what you need to build in as few layers as you only add complexity when you reach a problem which cannot be solved in a better than by adding that it is always easier to add complexity than to take it
