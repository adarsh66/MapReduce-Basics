a few things you can best thing to do is one such should let you mock out only the specific functions you that the next best thing is to provide the implementation of as a method of an object within the i find this one of the easier methods if you mock methods myclass function function return option is to add an so that the method behaves i recommend this either eventually have differing code paths and with their own option would be to subclass and override the behaviors you i suggest this since end up customizing your overridden mock to the point that have bugs itself if you need to mock out a method because its too that be a good sign to move it into its own object and use composition using the technique i mentioned

a very good rule that i came across a while an exception when a method do what its name says it idea is that an exception indicates that something has gone when you are implementing a it is not your responsibility to be aware of whether it will be used correctly or whether the code using your method catches the exception or not is not your but the responsibility of the person using your rule to follow catch an exception unless you know what you want to do with you should include cleanup code in a but you should never just catch an exception just for the sake of catching and you should never swallow exceptions while there are occasions when you may want to catch all exceptions by doing catch in these are fairly uncommon and generally have a very specific technical for when you are using threads in or if an exception escapes from your it will cause the entire application domain to in these at the very minimum you should log the exception details as an error and provide an explanation in the

all sound like discrete actions and thus not particularly restful in typically i will have a list action with filtering this filtering could be done via ajax since what it is returning is basically the same clicking on a particular item might bring me to a details view with an edit i might also include an edit button in the in which case clicking it would bring me to an details page in edit and edit would all be different and have different clicking the list button in view or edit would return me to the list clicking the save button in edit would return me to the view for that item this provides confirmation that the item has been errors in edit render the edit view with appropriate rule of thumb is to use ajax when the context of the view but a full request when a new action is this helps to keep the interface of you can do it any way you but mvc makes doing restful urls easier and restful urls make it easier for the user to bookmark a page to get back to it easily precisely because they map to a particular action on a particular data

almost as if is blocking indefinitely in the driver somewhere because the stick is no longer will ultimately emit a file system irp and not using so that irp will be but it looks like where the actual file system has abruptly disappeared from underneath the file system that irp is never which means stuffed the function call which lead to the file system irp being issued will never using that will prolly get you around this at least from the point of view of not you will still be experiencing resource loss and the since the irp will still be passed down and almost certainly still be coming back but at least you be blocking on for quick is i would say designed to reduce the amount of caching that goes on and perhaps influence the order of writes to the file system to reduce the chance of i extremely doubt it is intended to preserve the file system in the event of file system departure a should not be surprised that this kills the file

am working on a few php projects that use mvc and while they all have different ways of retrieving objects from the it always seems that nothing beats writing your sql queries by hand as far as speed and cutting down on the number of one of my web projects by a junior executes over 100 queries just to load the home the reason is that in one a method will load an but later on deeper in the it will load some other that are related to the first leads to the other part of the question which is what are people doing in situations where you have a table that in one part of the code only needs the values for a few and another part needs something right now the same there is one method for each and it does a lists all the columns in the table so that anytime you need the object for any you get the whole in other you hear all the talk about how select is but if you try to use a orm class that comes with the it wants to do just that are you stuck to choosing orm with select vs writing the specific sql queries by it just seems to me that stuck between convenience and and if i hand write the if i add a most likely going to have to add it to several places in the for the long but explaining the background to get some mindsets from other developers rather than maybe a specific i know that we can always use something like but i would rather optimize what we can before getting into for any is a good balance in an mvc model to have efficient data

and answers are spot in we integrate our source code control system call it is hierarchical with being at the and a tree of branches underneath it that general correspond to the organizational changes flow up and down this tree in a process of and this happens very regularly almost every day for the top level branches under and a bit less often for the lower level each major branch builds fully in at least four the top level branches build in six a flavor is something like or we also get some daily pseudo localized builds as i mean build a fully installable windows client product from this happens several hundred times per works well for us there are two important goals good code flow call it up and down the the idea is that any branch is never too different from integration errors as early as is very correct that this amortizes integration costs over the life of the for this makes the costs a lot lower than they would be if we deferred costs more toward the ends of this is how things used to not to air too much dirty but when i started in windows about 5 years getting a build out took a very long they now happen every like clock the windows engineering tools and release group gets all the credit for many others have suggested in various forums regular integration and full daily automated builds are essential for most daily and regular automated test are a whole other topic a massive effort as you can

answer is long answer is that the bathtub distribution a very good because of the lack of continuity in the way failures say for example that an input value of 42 causes a then the distribution of those failures will be exactly the distribution of 42 values in the not like as you software fail over it fails when it may be that misusing the words you my mean a rather than a a is one occurrence of incorrect a is a flaw in the a appearance of defects in software tends to have a but it really anywhere near as clean as your bugs tend to be observed early and taper then spike on patches and new with a general upward trend starting farther into the life of the even that takes careful as you really are talking about defects observed per unit having said modern se practices tend to change the actual rates but not the distribution of observed defects over here is worth a little definition the space shuttle hal software have very low defect using se techniques that were 20 years strong structured rigorous review and ocd version control and extreme programming tends to have low but many of the things more traditional methods would call xp calls since no finite and rigorous definition of what it a is just another have been decent studies to show that do result in low defect but be very surprised if the time distribution is a different

answer is when a closure captures a variable in is what is happening when your lambda refers to the variable the compiler applies a pretty precise rule about how to do the if the captured variable is within the same as determined by the surrounding and then the value of that variable will be captured as it if it is outside the then only a reference to that variable will be in your original the variable had already cycled through the entire loop to its last but if you make the modification mehrdad then you are capturing a variable in your same so the individual value of the variable will be embedded into your giving you the results you the you may but the variable is in the same but not because under the the compiler turns a into something like this is very just to show what happens with the var iterator your loop code your iterator for a will always be in a scope outside of the one where your loop code

approach you are referring to is viewmodel its where you have multiple complex view parts that need to bind to their own viewmodel the approach entails constructing a root viewmodel with properties for each child then the root view is bound to the root view model and each view displayed or is bound to the corresponding property on the root viewmodel would look like class rootviewmodel childviewmodela childa childviewmodelb childb view would look like could also implement this in away to allow yourself to select an active viewmodel would look like class rootviewmodel public childworkspaces public viewmodel activeworkspace public view would look like will result in the appropriate visual representation being selected implicity based on the type of the actual object stored in my response was in i tried my hardest to not get caught up in the syntax of it all you can see the plurality of can be often times we find the need to construct multiple to structure the viewmodel but all viewmodel entities would be somewhere within the root view model implementing mvvm in i prefer to infer what visual element to apply data context implicitly illustrated in the later half of this in more complex scenarios i prefer to use a datatemplateselector to conduct that but in super simple cases you can explicitly apply datacontext either imperatively in or declaratively through this

are is too wide a characterization to be if you ignore the differences in relative peformance offered by different regex how efficient your regex is still depends upon the complexity of the regex is efficient when it fails rather than succeeds to match a portion of text it needs to be specific enough so that text that going to match completely should be rejected early on in the matching process rather than reaching the this also means that backtracking needs to be note that backtracking can reach which would result even the best regex engine freezing in the example provided by jan the size of the file even mentioned and is not it is the size of the string which a discussion i started on a few years ago that attempted to get people discussing about performance of regular it does have a few pointers to learn i

are two primary ways to make a control automatically resize based on size changes of the parent container form in your the dock property of the control to the anchor property to the dock property with advantage of this method is that it takes the entire control and tells it to always fill the entire client area of the parent container your the form client useful if you want to do something like fill a form with a listcontrol or treeview or something like but not as useful if you want to scale a single control while using other controls you indicate is your in that you would need to set the dock property on those other controls to or to have them float above or below your main resizing a hassle and it also limits the layout options of the other you can mitigate that problem by docking two panel one at the top and another at the bottom of the those panels will remain in fixed positions while the middle area your scales with the parent you can then put any controls in any layout configuration in those and kind of composite using docked panels is incredibly quite it was game changing in when they introduced this with the anchor property with all you want to do is have a single control on a form while others stay to the use the anchor for the controls that you want to stay at the set the anchor property to for controls that you want to stay at the set the anchor property to for controls that you want to grow in width with the as a textbox set the anchor property to set top or bottom depending whether you want it move as the top or the bottom of the dialog if you want a control to resize in all directions with a set the anchor property to very useful for type of such as a dominant tree or what you mess with the autosize or those properties control how a control changes size based on its own not how it resizes based on its think of mode as inward while are outward you get some very bizarre behavior if you use both sizing methods at the same generally not

argue that this problem is simple to when viewed in the proper you care about order of the only whether they appear in a subset of the number of times each element appears in the for the one element set how many subsets are clearly there are only two now suppose we added another that is distinct from to form the set we can form the list of all sets very take all the sets that we formed using only and add in zero or one copy of in we double the number of clearly we can use induction to show that for n distinct the total number of sets is just that some elements appear multiple consider the set with three copies of thus how many subsets can you this is we can have or 3 copies of so the total number of subsets is 4 since order does not for n copies of the element we will end up with possible expand this by adding in some of copies of so we have n copies of a and m copies of how many total subsets are this seems clear to every possible subset with only a in it were of we can add between 0 and m copies of the total number of subsets when we have n copies of a and m copies of b is it must be we can use an inductive argument to show that the total number of subsets is the product of such merely count up the total number of replicates for each distinct add and take the what happens with the set we get the set we get

as force you to put everything within a server form as long as you use server control is the way how it handles the primary problem you would have is html does not allow nested form so you even use jquery to find the form element my experience with good answer hard to throw away webform and use compromise i did a small plugin myself which converts a div into an ajax submit with the div abused with and dress then utilize jquery form plugin to submit with a plugin it do file upload though that requires i think its still but take some more the code is in my project so i still dont have permission to post it as a however i think this is not too hard to do it once you know the theory aim for the good answer rid of next its not just jquery form going to hurt a lot more pain you have to take if you decided to do jquery web if its not my requirement i would never take this

be able to post more useful stuff later but for now i can tell you the term you want to search google for stuff to be frank any kiosk mode is more or less a windows mobile designed for it and as you get into more and more edge cases you are going to find the odd however for the purpose of most programs the following is the ui and the taskbar so that it be your main form set the windowstate to maximized and formborderstyle to older oses you might need to actually disable the taskbar itself and move the form over the top of this is achieved by with the argument may depend on hhtaskbar works for pocket pc and static extern intptr string with the intptr from findwindow and static extern bool bool with the intptr from findwindow and 0 static extern bool intptr int app know the press orange and left button and it will automatically open pocket do this going to break rank here and recommend the only viable way i know of doing this which is to use an undocumented win32 api a perfectly stable call and i have a range of projects running every day that use it i just figure in some future upgrade i might need to modify the code if it gets so bear that in want to setup a system wide keyboard hook via the pinvoke static extern intptr hookhandlerdelegate intptr uint is reasonably complex and its probably better just to point to a guide like to explain the the basic premise is to discover the keycode of the irritating and then block them via the hook pass them working on cf i suggest also digging into opennetcf as i believe it already has a global keyhook inside i said before this perfect and iirc the volume control is not blockable and its possible that a notification such as a new wireless network might intrude upon your kiosk mode if you set various flags in the registry tell it not to do that not that much effort and it should be sufficient for most of your your app run from start is the bit that can differ a fair bit depending on the if you want to stay in managed code the issue is that the netcf come on some in most cases you can just write an unmanaged booter that sits in the autorun directory should be check the and installs your and then runs your if you want to get your hands dirty with unmanaged code then most hardware manufacturers offer some kind of scripting system to setup a device as you see however these may work with varying degrees of

business model was actually rampant during the dot com company a thought it would provide an email service for free and once it has a million users it could other services or add on some premium if even users sign on that would still generate a good residual monthly income from a 100k but as soon as company a goes premium another company would come out with the same model offering the same services for free and company model company a then might resort to increasing switching costs and locking people in though email has a high switching cost this work but another reason i bring this up is that this is exactly what you could be facing down the you could make a strong case for sustaining for 5 years but if a company comes out 4 years from now and does a really good job of the same just lost a lot of time and money but they got in even if your switching costs are high and your users are locked entirely possible that the new company might offer a migration path to circumvent just this and you could then take measures to really hijack the data but not that easy and it would lead to negative publicity from frustrated users feel their data is theirs to your question is quite i provide much feedback but unless the scenario is really compelling a hard road to tread even if larry page approached me with a search engine want to know the monetization strategy patents provide a safety is also the question of employee employees get nice perks and bonuses because always strapped for cash and they always feel that the reward is too far you will end up giving out a lot of stock options and raising multiple rounds of investments which be gives you a safety net in that when five years from now it becomes you can execute on your idea and still have and even if you fail to execute execute you may take comfort in the fact that someone else might be able to execute while you can get if you really want to get this thing out you might be able to throttle your costs by making it an beta so you end up mushrooming your it will also provide you with a platform that you can mature over the years and as hardware becomes more affordable you can continue to issue more

but a for loop probably what you when you use two for your inner loop keeps going back to the start every time the outer loop so if your vectors 10 9 8 4 7 6 4 3 your final array will contain something 10 10 10 10 9 9 9 9 9 8 8 8 8 8 7 6 4 4 4 7 6 4 3 you are testing every single and adding the larger one to the final a better solution might be to remember an iterator for each and just use one rather than looping over a just go through both of them together if sarray has the larger then increment your sarray and compare that with the old farray stop your loop when both sarray and farray are fiter siter traverse both farray and want to stop this loop once traversed both siter if we must have gone right through farray so use the value from and go to the next else if we must have gone right through sarray so use the value from and go to the next else if siter is the bigger of the two add it to the final go to the next sarray else fiter is the bigger of the two add it to the final go to the next farray tested it and if this is for then try to understand what go away and write it rather than

compiler will emit and if you define a so really just save some has been an interesting this is something from my favorite book via is what i i like and i wish that they were supported in the framework and its the reason is properties look like fields but are this has been known cause a phenomenal amount when a programmer code that appears to be accessing there are many assumptions that the programmer makes that not be true for a property may be or field access is readable and if you a it is best to offer get and set accessor property method may throw an field access never an property cannot be passed as an out or ref parameter to a field property method can take a long time to field access completes a reason to use properties is perform thread which can stop the thread a property should not used if thread nization in that a method is if your class can be accessed remotely your class is derived the property method will be and a method preferred to a in classes derived marshalbyrefobject should never called multiple times in a a property method may a different value each field returns the same value the class has a only now property that the current date and each time you query this it return a different this is and microsoft wishes they could fix the class by now a method instead of a property method may cause observable side field access never in other a user of a type should be able to set properties defined by a type in order he or she chooses noticing any different behavior the property method may require additional memory or return reference to something that is actually part of the so modifying the returned object no effect on the original querying a field always returns reference to an object that guaranteed to be part of the original working with property that returns a copy can very confusing to this characteristic is frequently not

designing a very simple terms of but difficult terms of system where users can message each think of it as a very simple chatting a user can insert a message through a php the message is short and has a recipient another php the user can view all the messages that were sent to him all at once and then deletes them on the all the functionality needed for this how should i go about designing this a point of far i have the table like message recipient for sql i find that the time it takes is constant regardless of number of rows in the so my will have a guaranteed return time which is for pulling down my will take longer as the number of rows i find the sql select will take longer as the rows grow and this is true even after i have an index for the recipient if it was simply the case that users will have to wait a longer time before their messages are pulled on the php then it would have been but what i am worried is that when each service time takes really the php server will start to refuse connections to some or worse the server might just the question how to design this such that it any some estiamte on of users starts with and goes user on average have around 10 messages stored before the other end might pull it user sends around messages a from reading the answers so just want to clarify that by pulling down less messages from does not even just pull one message will take a long time when the table is this is because the table has all the messages so you have to do a select like message from db where recipient if you change it to this it help top 1 message from db where recipient far from the answers it seems like the longer the table the slower the select will be or slightly no way around if that is the how should i handle this from the php i want the php page to fail on the http because the user will be confused and end up refreshing like mad which makes it even some suggestion for a database schema

do you want to store these in a unless you doing something out of the there will be a small number of the overhead of maintaining a set is probably higher than just putting them in a vector and doing a linear searching will happen more frequently than adding and you can just use a sorted there is a operator defined for so you can sort the vector insert into the correct after each addition or and use to do a binary this is the same complexity as searching a and should have lower overhead for small amounts of you still need to do how about just treating it as a and operating on example assumes that the size of is a multiple of the size of an and that there is no and no virtual if that is not it will have to be or will not work at i took a look at the and it has a as a so the code below is horribly i think the only solution is to have the authors of add a hash leaving the example just in case its useful in some other the next line do anything useful in this hash int i i hash

even as a rule of simply saying hard to make them but frameworks are very much like simulation and various other the fact that hard in javaworld a fact about but about the abstractions available in another like both fairly are pretty still sounds like he has the wrong i see anything inherent in the problem that forces a locking the i come in since we are using we will naturally be doing separately within each and unfortunately we have the lock ordering we have different kinds of activities going that want to acquire locks in so deadlock is why is deadlock almost because two different kinds of activities are going on that want to acquire locks in opposite and that is because will naturally be doing locking separately within each other chosen or had chosen for him by the environment abstractions that support his it he appears to that thus there are no abstractions that i find this start by examining two we will be doing locking separately within and have events going on that want to acquire locks in opposite my usually means really looked for other and i very much doubt that the events want to acquire locks in opposite yu get a you do and you release point he appears to be presenting the fact that he finds it hard to come up with a scheme that work as a theorem to say that no scheme a lot more details about the hard to construct a but as i said there are lots of examples of systems that have events going on every which from internal processes and that manage to have many concurrent threads of control and erlang came to mind because one class of those is the one for which erlang was and in fact those sorts of issues are erlang was

form controller as or uses commands to pass data between the html form and my question is it common practice to use the backing model as the command or is it common to create a separate command with correspond attributes to those in the backing issue is that to use the backing model as the property editors are necessary for conversion of imagine a data model with many strongly typed custom field on a form property editor does the conversion before the validator is if the type conversion is not possible input then the validator never gets a chance to provide a detailed error all displayed on the html form is a generic error see my stackoverflow alternative is to create a separate command that duplicates each field in the backing but as a in this way the validator can validate the string representation of each the is then responsible for converting the command to the backing from my research of spring this appears to be intended my hesitation to go down this path is the cumbersome manner in which a separate command needs to be created for each data then the added work having to marshal between the command and the data so much more convenient to have the form directly edit the backing model and use property editors to do the the problem then is curious how others approach the issue of editing of models that contain custom typed of spring form

found submodules to be particularly useful on the projects worked once set them working on the whole project requires adding additional parameters to almost every command and the syntax completely i imagine if i worked on larger projects with more see it as a more beneficial are two possibilities that keep the as independent git repos that you pull from into your main bring your external projects into separate in your main repo that includes your core this makes it easy to update the main project from the external but complicated to send changes back to the external i think of this as a good way to include project but it work so well with shared simple explanation up each as a remote in your main repo and merge from each of them into your branch that also contains your core this requires some if you make any changes to the external projects in your main they must be made in the branch and then merged into the and you never want to merge into the project this makes it easy to send changes back to the external projects and is a perfectly acceptable use of branches in shared scripts can be handled as another independent branch in your main directory which your external partners can pull from and push to as a remote you try to run svn git in the same you make it very hard to use branching in either because svn does branching by copying file directories while git tracks neither system would automatically see branches you make in the i think that is more trouble than it is

from user intentionally deferring database design decisions until at least the first cut at the stories are far too the components of various user procedures are distorted by the requirements of relational integrity and table maintenance how often have we all seen a new sales order being and the user is required to navigate several forms to fill in customer details requiring phone calls fake data for mandatory fields that really credit information that really comes from another cancelled entries due to incomplete information discovered several pages seldom does anyone maintain and review usability metrics like pages keystrokes interrupted though the mission of the customer and the productivity of the users should be the primary determinants of software

generated using and used the function and a local function to color which is working have results from a statistical test that indicate if a set of nodes the cluster of and in the corner of the are significant or also have a local function that i can use with that finds the exact node in my dendrogram which contains significant would like to either the the edges that join and a around and have the following local function details of the condition but that it highlights significant function if a leaflist for in clusterlist if i now have a node that contains significant like to use a call to another local which colors the edges that run down to the a around the within this i have tried calling but this did not function a my ideal the edges connecting and would be dashed and of a red have also tried using within this h x border the result does not work with horizontal dendrograms dendrograms with horizontal is an the red stripe in the something is not correct about the dimensions of what and i know how it to be able to write my own appreciate any advice for getting or to work or to be able to write my own asking this i used to get the functional code that calculates parameters and draws the i wrote a custom version of this function to handle horizontal and vertical and call it with there is some kind of clipping effect that removes part of the for horizontal leaves that are drawn on the right side of the the rightmost edge of the either disappears or is thinner than the border width of the other three sides of the for vertical leaves that are drawn on the bottom of the the bottommost edge of the suffers the same display i had done as a means of marking significant clusters is to reduce the width of the such that i render a vertical red stripe between the tips of the cluster edges and the leaf eliminates the clipping but introduces another in that the space between the cluster edge tips and the leaf labels is only six or so pixels which i have much control this limits the width of the vertical worse problem is that the that marks where the vertical stripe can fit between the two elements will change based on the width of the larger tree which in turn depends on how the tree hierarchy ends up being wrote a better a hack to adjust this value and the width for horizontal it always work but for the trees i am it seems to keep from getting too close to edges and a better fix would be to find out how to draw the so that there is no or a consistent way to calculate the specific position in between tree edges and labels for any given so as to center and size the stripe would also be very interested in a method for annotating edges with colors or line do i color edges or draw rects correctly in an r

going to break ranks with the answers to date and suggest the following reason that a 1d array is quite possibly 2d array involves 2 memory for instance first must lookup and then do another lookup of that 1d implementation traditionally would be when width is in registers a this means 2 math ops and 1 lookup instead of 2 lookups are orders of magnitude slower than math so if width is in register even a small percent of the or is a it will be course the standard caveats always and avoid premature

good situation that sparse branching is suitable for is when you have a complicated product potentially made up of lots of say the build takes a long time for the whole and perhaps the sync takes a while too lots of data but your development only needs to modify a small subset of the whole source base maybe a module or with possibly some linkage code this doing a sparse branch can make a lot of it means you have already synced to the bulk of the and probably already built but you do have to be careful that any files you modify are branched first otherwise you risk breaking the certainly it requires more care by the case where sparse branching may be the only practical way of doing branched development is if it is hard to have more than one version of your app on a development in this case it would be tricky to have both a mainline build and a development build building and running side by obviously not but some products are like that either by necessity or

hard to judge the joel quote without any prior give my opinion from a sustainable software development point of view which things is good and you should do it whenever you feel like things have spun out of things get out of you often write the same bit of code better the second time around because you have learnt from your previous you and start afresh and decide to continue you may just be adding to the often developers write code and get too far into their first attempt that they think they can code their way out of if you are in that rollback and start again and be much easier to write the code you want and not have it turn out looking like a plate full of into the habit of out code forget about code quality and just spend a amount of time to code a simple version and then start again and find that be easier second time around when you do it with quality and testing in sure what just said within the context of the quote as it probably refers to systems many years old and not to the entire code base from scratch

i feel for it sounds like a lot of sorts of issues do you are all the swfs treatable as different is there much overlap in the logic or does each object have a specific think having so many different swfs may possibly lead to scoping which swf talks to you may be able to set up something with as3 that uses the existing parts and then try making a facade over the existing code use the existing logic in the swfs and do the visual part through other than all i can advise is a you might find yourself in need of a swf decompiler too if you are missing some of the original

i know but i still am pretty much a rest and form helpers are completely different i understand state transfer is only loosely related to the actual rendering of forms and really has to do with and to a certain extend the idea is that instead of trying to think about an entire conversation with a you write a webapp to respond in predictable ways to individual client if a client gets a you just retrieve format it for send it to and forget about a client posts an update of some you change the webapps state to reflect send back any and then forget about any future get or post will look at the new but not the message that created whether or not an application is restful depends not really on how complicated the model but on how users interact with an app meant to be at least somewhat that is is a good candidate for something that relies heavily on and interacting with a specific and is might not be such a good the other you have rails form these are great for but sometimes can be frustrating when you try to use them in more complicated what is your main do you have a specific question about rails form about rails or something specific to

i remember and been a few years so i may be that action is only included if you are using a hybrid installscript msi project so it would be used to run installscript actions before file copy adding a condition to it going to cause a problem if you have any installscript actions in although it leads to the question of why you want the condition in the first are probably better of using the basic msi project type which will just include the standard msi it means you have the dependency on the isscript installshield run time as well so just generally a better practice and entirely removes the worry behind your

i think your second assumption may be is the right way to check for of two not overload resolution for operators is at compile not run the compiler can definitively know the types of the objects applying an operator it since the compiler cannot be sure that an is going to be something that has an override for it falls back to the default implementation of see this more try defining an for and adding two unless you explicitly cast to it will fail to because the compiler tell that a particular is an and there is no default implementation to fall back to in of your frustration probably stems from the fact that implements an and everything is an so the compiler can successfully resolve operations like for all when you overrode you expected to see the same behavior but and because the best match the compiler can find is the original all comparisons to use equals rather than is not a viable especially when passing your types to libraries as my this is precisely what you should be is the right way to check for of two sometimes semantic equality is just reference in which case you need to change in other as in your override when you need a stronger equality contract than reference for you may want to consider two equal if they have the same social security or two equal if they have the same and are not the same whenever you need to override you should override but almost never the other way is more of a syntactical some clr languages visual even permit you to override the equality

i understand the question mark wants to see an overview of all the last results for each means for every result he only wants to see only one and that is the result which has last been added for that think the easiest way to achieve would be to create an additional which we can call for class public int resultid public int resulttypeid public datetime resultdate class should not be but nhibernate should be aware that this class have to import we can create an icriteria which will populate instances of myresultoverview which will also generate the most efficient sql query in order to get this should look something like criteria results should give you a list of myresultoverview instances which represent the myresults that looking in order to retrieve the myresult you can simply do this by retrieving the myresult instance for that particalur resultid that retrieved as tested nor did i compile but this is the path that i would follow to achieve

in the world are you using the literals in your sql there is zero chance that have so why use forces a distinct to occur and little slower than since you have something that looks like no possibility that ever have it to union all and your query will perform much is fundamental sql writing a well tuned query is more important than creating view start with the understand tune your then worry about spending space and slowing dml to improve query literals in the query prevent dupes between the only remaining possibility is dupes within a since the columns look like pks and there are no joins that could induce duplication and since the tables all look like lookup what i said is if that assumption true than you have a legitimate use of union without an however i find that of the time people really meant to use all and a standard at our company to add a comment to sql with only union because so often a union yes i need a distinct

inference is a feature of some it is done by the compiler to assign types to entities that otherwise lack any type the compiler effectively just the static type information on behalf of the inference tends to work more poorly in languages with many implicit coercions and so most type inferenced languages are functional languages with little in the way of inference is part of the language for the example the spec goes into great detail about the type inference algorithm and as this effectively determines is a legal some languages support some limited forms of type inference in for the most part people use to refer to languages where the vast majority of types are inferred rather than explicit in function and method in addition to local are typically contrast to where allows inference of local variables but method declarations require full type

is a program that interprets commands written in some xml you as justinhj mentioned in his answer use some xml parser the mentioned and convert the xml description in some kind of lisp data and then write additional code in you need to reimplement also some of the ant of the primitive stuff in ant is not needed in some file operations are in lisp some are missing and need to be implemented alternative you can use one of the existing also note that you can load lisp files into lisp and execute code there is also the repl so it comes already with an interactive frontend level build systems in common lisp usually are implementing an abstraction called there are several of is a popular but there are a system has subsystems and a system has also a few its components also have a system has either a structural description of the a description of the or a kind descriptions of and their typically these things are implemented in an way and you can implement as lisp lisp also brings functions like which will use the lisp compiler to compile a if your code c files you would need to call a c compiler usually through some implementation specific function that allows to call external programs the c mentioned by is a popular lispworks provides allegro cl has their own its describes also how to extend the lisp solution are using some kind of xml usually implemented by a macro to describe the once that is read into it turns into a data representation often with clos instances for the the actions then are also lisp some functions then walk over the component and execute actions of some other tools walk over the component and return a representation for actions which is then a proposed the user then can let lisp execute the whole or parts of the a lisp machine a simple system description looks like defines a system scigraph and all files should be compiled and load in serial i can see what the lisp machine would do to update the compiled compile system system scigraph the plan for constructing scigraph version newest for the compile operation compile load would compile one file and load it i have the software loaded and changed only this file so asdf see the documentation mentioned on the cliki page it works a bit

is about keyboard messages in general and does not apply to actionscript i misread the question and provided a deeper answer then was the path from keyboard to windows char is a very complex it goes something like send scancode to keyboard device driver sends a message to the system message system then sends the message to the foreground thread that created the window with the current keyboard message loop picks up the message and figures out the correct character char that was typed is not calculated until it finishes that whole as each window and thread can be on a different locale and you really the key without knowing the locale and key buffer and messages cannot just be converted with mapvirtualkey or something because you know how many key presses make up a single the simple method is just handle the event and use consider the you press the following keys a you get the following output you press the following keys a you get the following output in both examples you would get 3 keyup but in the first you get 3 and in the second you only get following article is really good for the basic

is an appropriate choice to learn a lot more transparent than hibernate and the api is often easier to work much easier to setup and get going as documentation is although it does have a few gotchas does every orm framework if not used with has more features than openjpa and if you are looking to use it on a medium to large commercial product google app then i would certainly choose this more stable than openjpa also least with the version i used only book ever bought on persistence is the christian bauer persistence with covers the basic jpa and hibernate in but a tough read and only really treated it as a reference overall and if you want to learn hibernate in detail then the best place to it is two years old at so there may be other books that are more up to with some tutorials before you buy the book just start by building a simple crud app in either hibernate or openjpa and look at the sql using behind the easily the best way to understand going hope that

is not a solution is more efficient in terms of where the array may be sparse you can use null pointer to represent a matrix line of all this would be each would be allocated 2d array is not necessarily an array of will generally be faster in terms of since it works out memory locations with without having to memory talking of the 1d array of the unlikely to be any faster than the equivalent 2d version since you still have to do the calculations at some point to find the correct cell in your code rather than letting the compiler do edit where java was added as a believe java 2d arrays are of the array of arrays variety will require two memory accesses as opposed to the one required for a 1d so the 1d array with manual index calculation may well be instead of declaring and may get more speed just need to be careful that you get the formula mixed up anywhere swap 4 and 7 speed difference is based on how i think java is coded under the covers so i could be wrong i doubt it my advice as always for optimisation

is not possible to use managedthreadid in this this is a completely managed concept and has no real representation in the native hence it make any sense to the passing it reason managedthreadid exists is because there is not necessarily a mapping between a native and managed the clr is free to use multiple native threads to run a single managed thread as long as the native thread is compatible with the one it cannot for be in a different com some ways a bit stuck there is no way to guarantee that you will have the same native thread for a given managed you can achieve a very high level of guarantee though if you are for instance running a winforms or wpf application and the call to native code occurs on the ui the reason being that both of these ui frameworks live in sta apartments which makes it very hard even for the clr to switch out from under if in a winforms or wpf application and running this on the ui you can assume a reasonable level of stability for this

is nothing insecure about using md5 in this md5 was only broken in the sense there are algorithms given a bunch of data a additional data b can be generated to create a desired if someone knows the hash of a they could produce a string that will result with that these generated strings are usually very long so if you limit passwords to 20 or 30 characters still probably main reason to use sha1 over md5 is that md5 functions are being phased for example the silverlight library does not include the md5 cryptography

is on the right but a word of am sure the second command line is not needed find find is useful if you think that your file may have been but on a big that process can be extra the it find the file if it has been is on a vob with a few months or years of it will simply take too much for each element it would display the all history for versions of that without any possibility to refine that set of versions that solution simply does not and the of the command does not bring any value to the problem at it would only display the version just because of internal comments like hyperlink or hyperlink need to refine your query type of element wanted it is a date for instance would limit the date range to would cleartool find f mylogin descr would only look for files by me for a certain date which is a way to have a smaller set of versions to that i use which is only for the version not for displaying the all history of an element like your file has been run again the same command with the option would only find along with their branches and that are not visible not have a standard path in the if you specify a date with a day the whereas we are not the 28th of april it will always select 0 versions is not relevant for your but if you enter a before by that can lead to the false impression that there is no version to where there actually are versions to be

it does make sense in this use cases differ here in that they cannot be used in the same use cases will be usefull to extract and formalize was workinng in a ui lab a while back and we toyed with this though we did not call it as basic idea here is that we would use agile iterative approach to development where we would use usability tesing to help converge on a desired cycle would be a few requirements and use very limited in scope very a test protocol that would allow us to gather data on this feature ease of performace or expand the application to include this a few users test the application using agile adaptation of usability testing handbook of usability where we would limit test sessions to 15 minutes with a 15 minutes usefull data from testing to inject in future method was perticularely usefull when the users would either not know exactly what they wanted or could not tell we would therefore have to devise tests that would gather objective data on the actuall usefulness of the software to the user and try to ajust the next iteration of our if i may call them so were heavily handicapped and could not talk so we had to be way of working forced us to have a gui available to the client very early in the development life and because it was the central point where we would direct testing one could say it was gui driven desing since the driving force for convergence was the user interactions with the we developped this technique mostly for very specific cases we did some testing with normal users on a normal software and got very positive the desing would converge very quickly towards the also the fact that they participated in this desing approach had also very positive effects on the acceptance of the product in the target internal strifes had the lab dismanteled before we could publish our results and expand this line of a shame uidd you pardon the bad would be a member of the tdd family of approaches towards software development where the iterations hinges around user reading on the subject

joel is way off in his and his conclusions and recommendations are not based on any fundamentally he says that you should be able to schedule your work down to units of time of hours or less before you even but the reality is you know what those units of work are all going to be before you get in to the so you come up with an breakdown of what going to do before you even pop the hood and have that breakdown reflect what actually happens with any a project estimate is very difficult if you want that estimate to be of any coming up with accurate estimates is difficult for programmers because very often you discover all the complexities of the project until you get under the the solution to this is to get under the hood when coming up with for smaller projects bug fixes this is fairly the bug on your the code that is causing the out how to write the code that will fix the how long it will take you to write that finding the code you have to write you necessarily must discover most or all the complexities that would have thrown off your interesting thing about this method is that the time it takes to generate the estimate is very often of the total time to actually do the you practically have to do the work in order to come up with an with bug fixes the solution is often on the order of one line of so your estimate will end up being 5 fine because deadlines can be set around estimates like you get practice with this you will get better and better at how long things will at first only be able to how long the smallest projects will but over time you will be able to estimate larger larger

lists are often implemented using arrays which makes them very fast and by their nature do not require dynamic you just need a quick check on the read and the write indexes to see if they fell off the end and if reset it to zero they are generally used for things like input where the data has no real value once contact lists have lasting value and new contacts will overwrite older contacts once the list fills which might be ok unless you overwrite your grandmom who is leaving you a bunch of cash in her do not think that a linked list is the most efficient way to go for a circular buffer original purpose of a circular buffer is speed and an array simply cannot be beaten for speed in the context of a circular even if you keep a pointer to your last accessed linked list an array will still be more lists have dynamic resizing capabilities that are unneeded for circular said i think a circular buffer is probably not the right structure for the application you

lot of people seem to struggle with the concept of arrays at particularly arrays of a little too getting past that initial block just requires a concrete exploration of the an example used a lot that shows the basic mechanics in a say building a role playing game and you want to keep track of your you could use an array of integers like could be strength could be dexterity could be so add a level of maybe we want to introduce a potion of strength that increases strength by 5 for 10 we could represent the stat side of that by making this into a this is my current this is my normal this is the number of turns until the strength potion wears this is my current so you get the added a 2nd dimension to hold details about the 1st what if i wanted our stats array to handle statistics for more than one i could represent that by making this into a character current character current would be even better to create some constants or enums to eliminate magic numbers from the strength dexterity intelligence currentvalue 0 normalvalue potionturns i could 5 character set the normalvalue of dex to few more thoughts about at least in the world where i most of us have to use them in our lives too often because slowly being relegated to underpinnings for more elaborate data structures like if i were to implement character realistically i would not use still important to get your head around them because they are and there are definitely cases where

make it work you must both embed some object type information in data it is only useful for and usually use external schema definition which otherwise would not be needed xml schema for since basically a generic type has same problems as orm hibernate has to use ugly way or discriminator another way to put data is not quite the same as object tries to preserve more of object i am assuming that what you want is basically something pet possibly get an exception if pet is an abstract l this is not the you could just simply bind to dog jackson project has request for doing just which allow you to do what you this solution will mostly work for as there is no standard way of passing object type info within with xml this can sort of be done with xml schema defined which identifies schema which is then mapped to class rather complicated but it does added support for this implemented feature so it can be used for generating type to allow proper handling of polymorphic it should work with systems given that you can fully configure details of how type information is to be and is not limited to using java class	
makes more sense to ask about a particular aspect of a bit like asking windows key parts of linq are for from a these are representations of code as for an expression tree could represent the notion of a string call the length property on and return the the fact that these exist as rather than as compiled code means that linq providers such as linq to sql can analyze them and convert them into these are expressions like x int x expressions are converted either into or these are expressions like are still statically just the compiler generates an immutable type for you with properties and these are usually used with which allows the type of a local variable to be inferred from its initialization these are expressions like person in are translated by the compiler into a form which use query overload resolution etc is applied which is absolutely key to being able to use the same query syntax with multiple data without the compiler having any knowledge of types such as the above expression would be translated these are static methods which can be used as if they were instance methods of the type of the first for an extension method like static int string return letter letter then be used like foo count that the implementation of uses another extension most of the relevant then there are the implementations of the standard query in linq providers such as linq to objects and linq to sql i have a presentation about how reasonably simple to implement linq to objects on the page of the in depth web way providers such as linq to sql work is generally via the at their they translate expression trees into other query and then construct appropriate objects with the results of executing those that cover everything you were interested if anything in particular you still want to know just edit your question and have a

my comments on your is a bad name for what essentially is a layer assigned to abstract i would probably call it or or dao access instead of which is ambiguous and could absolutely mean you really want to decouple your business layer from your your logic layer should only accept interfaces to the and not concrete dal are two schools of thought as to where validation should some are completely fine with validation sitting at the ui others would rather throw exceptions or pass messages from the business whichever way you just be duplicate validations in multiple and be ahead and try coding would probably be the best piece of advice i could give well and fine thinking it but at one point need to see it while coding it and only then will subtle quirks and pitfalls reveal whatever prototypes you can come up with will definitely be valuable to the direction your development and design takes your within the same namespace or calls to concrete classes are definitely i think it will be overly convoluted for you to need to put up interfaces for business logic i mean is there more than one set of rules you should a believer of keeping things simple and following make an interface until there are more than two classes that are going to implementing that interface dal is always an exception to this

my opinion a complex compiler is more difficult to write than a complex emulator for the simple reason that the compiler involves much more designing your language xx there is a whole lot of factors to consider not to mention optimizing the output of the compiler generated code which is a black art in with an emulator you have an already environment with a mostly language that you want to any case i recommend anybody to write and write a compiler because it gives you a deeper understanding of just like doctor needs to know about the body anatomy even though he may not need it in his daily i think both skills are very useful and one can actually combine them they are not would like to add to my opinion above is that creating a programming language including to interact with databases etc and that can evolve with future versions but still remain backwards compatible is one of the more challenging areas in also agree that if the platform is unknown you are reverse engineering something then it is much more difficult to do an but otoh that is not what question was was

not possible since assigning it to a derived class reference would be like saying class is a fully capable substitute for derived it can do everything the derived class can which is not true since derived classes in general offer more functionality than their base class the idea behind could write a constructor in the derived class taking a base class object as copying the like class base public int public void do stuff with class derived base public int public otherdata default public void do some other that case you would copy the base object and get a fully functional derived class object with default values for derived this way you can also avoid the problem pointed out by jon b new d new also new copy construct a derived with values of now

of for using balsamiq to mock up the would really have a think about make sure your users are happy with only seeing 3 or so categories on screen at offer as many alternatives as you can think and allow them to pick a couple to go forward to a for could you provide them with an aggregate and allow a drill down with the prototype they can make the final decision with mocked up offer anything you are unhappy you are going to be responsible for it working in the you are already past the prototype stage and happy with the as a rough structure i would start with a first of all see what 3rd party control library will offer out of the these control libraries always offer significantly more customisation than the base infragistics is one i would feel able to recommend generally but i confirm it will do the kind horizontal scrolling you would want to make a custom cell implementation for the title you are unlikely to get the look you want out of the this is pretty straight forward to scrollbar will be tricky unless a 3rd party datagrid offers only scrolling a portion of the columns assume you want the 2 columns on the right to be onscreen at all if you get a control to do this for i would start by trying to fake put the and columns into a completely new grid you can then put a horizontal scroll bar onto the left gridview and keep them visually together by dropping them both into a pane you will need to data bind them both separately to the correct columns so that they are kept in synch with the underlying subtotal controls at the bottom i would keep as simple text boxes and bind them directly to your domain model calculations for these

of what you do in programming all day is combining some functions together to build bigger functions from usually you have not only functions in your toolbox but also other things like variable assignments and the but generally your program combines together lots of to bigger computations that will be combined together monad is some way to do this of your most basic to combine two computations together is you say this you mean do then do the result is basically again a computation that can be combined together with more is a simple it is a way of combing small computations to bigger the says the thing on the then do the thing on the thing that can be seen as a monad in object oriented languages is the often you find things like basically means the computation on the and then call the method on the right on the result of it is another way to combine a little more complicated than and the concept of chaining things together with is a since a way of combining two computations together to a new fairly common that has no special is this return return return return value of indicates but there is no real way to abstract out this error even if you have lots of that you need to combine in this this is basically just another monad that combines the function calls by the rule the function on the left returned do return otherwise call the function on the if we had an operator that did this thing we could simply would make things more readable and help to abstract out our special way of combining so that we need to repeat ourselves over and over there are many more ways to combine that are useful as a general pattern and can be abstracted in a enabling the user of the monad to write much more concise and clear since all the and management of the used functions is done in the example the above could be extended to the error checking and then call the right side on the socket that we got as so that we need to explicitly specify lots of formal definition is a bit more complicated since you have to worry about how to get the result of one function as an input to the next if that function needs that input and since you want to make sure that the functions you combine fit into the way you try to combine them in your but the basic concept is just that you formalize different ways to combine functions

one more and someone else has already optimized this problem for until actually measured your code and traced a performance problem to this part of you have no reason not to do the straightforward you are worried about then abstract the problem make a class to wrap whatever lookup mechanism you end up using and write your code to use this you can change the implementation later if you find you need some other data structure for greater up on hash are and if you are worried about their time or space you should read up on how this is basic computer the short of it is that hash tables case lookup space about depending on various do not know where you read that they were but if they then they would not be in practical use as they are in most languages there are two advantages to these nice properties of hash lookup time implies that you will not pay a cost in lookup time for having a larger as lookup time depend on space implies that you gain much of anything from breaking your dictionary up into smaller space scales linearly with number of so lots of small dictionaries will not take up significantly less space than one large one or vice this would not be true if they were but lucky for are some more resources that might article on hash gives a great listing of the various lookup and allocation schemes used in scheme has a nice discussion of how much space you can expect hashtables to take including a formal discussion of why amount of space used by the hash table is proportional to the number of associations in the this might interest are some things you might consider if you find you actually need to optimize your dictionary is the c source code for in case you want all the copious documentation in is a of in case you like reading to hashtable class talk a bit about how load factors and how they affect the space your hash takes note a tradeoff between your load factor and how frequently you need to rehashes can be

original code would benefit from using multiple return statements there is no need to hop around the error return clean up you normally need the allocated space released on an ordinary return too otherwise you are leaking and you can rewrite the example without if you are this is a case where you can usefully declare variables before otherwise char char char if 0 0 use p3 there are amounts of work after each allocation then you can use a label before the first of the and a is ok error handling is the main reason for using these and anything much else is somewhat look after some code which does have macros with embedded goto it is confusing on first encounter to see a label that is by the visible yet that cannot be i prefer to avoid such macros are ok when i need to know what they do they just do macros are not so ok when you have to know what they expand to to use them if they hide information from they are more of a nuisance than a names disguised to protect the rerrcheck if if else goto else are several dozen variants on that are somewhat similar different sizes and different loader place where these are used contains this loop in a larger block of code in a single case of a large switch with some small and some big blocks of code particularly well for 0 i obvious that the code there is laced with goto and a full exegesis of the sins of the code it comes from would take all day they are many and

problem here is that i would like to pass an object to a derived but it must be done before the base class since the base class will immediately call the derived method that uses the an excerpt from the base from for abstract class public if public abstract bool public abstract void the derived class that myderived private string public myderived sampleobject public override bool return public override void doubt you can make execute a derived constructor before the base so really just looking for a solution to pass an object to the derived class before the object is gotten around this by putting the if block inside the there are other classes deriving from the base so i ended up having to repeat this block of code in every derived like to see an alternative to modifying the base a derived constructor before the base constructor in

problem is that i am trying to run a problem that i coded using a what my program is supposed to do is take user input my queries for a database system lex and and then execute the corresponding what actually happens is that my parser code is not correctly interpreting the string literals that i feed my insertexpr expr expr new my following the insert syntax unexpected expecting end of file or end of line or insert or if i remove the string literal from my code on line the program runs just in after storing the input data and the integer returned right back to me i thought this was an issue with character bison code needs to be compiled and run using the same which should not be an issue seeing as i am compiling and running from the same system you guys need any more info or code let me does not appear to recognize c string literals

process has its own memory it makes it more difficult to share but also makes the program safer need for explicit that being processes can share the same memory in thread is cheaper to create or but the main difference is that it shares memory with other threads in the same this is sometimes and in addition crashing the process would kill all advantage of using multiple processes over multiple threads is that it would be easier to scale your program to work with multiple machines that communicate via network you could potentially run 16 processes on 8 but would not have a benefit from more than 4 threads on a if the amount of information you need to communicate is multiprocessing may make more for the i would say that suggests if you follow mvc your gui should not also contain the model with you can then communicate to a work manager that can report what data is already	
processing arguments to a the powershell parser splits adjacent expressions into discrete arguments if the first fragment is a recognizable expression as is the case with because powershell is we try to preserve object integrity until we absolutely have to render to a if you want to force string expansion put around the entire argument sequence as one of the other posters note that an argument with a leading character like will be treated as if it was a string this is because the leading characters are not recognized as a valid expression so we default to treating it as an expandable powershell

really depends on the ha system if your system uses a shared ip and the traffic is managed by some hardware then it can be hard to determine if a certain box is a master or that will depend on a specific solution as long as you can add a custom script to the you should be ok for example the controller can ping a daemon on the master server every in the alerting simply check if the time of the last ping 2 your system have a supervisor controller but each node tries to determine the state you can have more if a split brain you can end up with both slaves or both so your alerting software will be wrong in both gadgets that can ensure only one live node and could the other in the second if the ha software works on both hosts you should be able to obtain the information straight from it has to know its own state at any because one of its main in most ha solutions you should be able to either get the current or add some code to run when the state heartbeat offers worry about the edge cases like a split brain almost any situation when you lose connection between the clustered nodes will be more important than the stuff that happens on the separate nodes the thing you care about is really logging alerting then ideally you could have a separate logger box which gets all the information about the current network cluster external box will probably have better idea how to deal with the if your cluster gets disconnected from the network loses you get any a redundant pair of independent monitors can save you from not sure why you mentioned dns due to its refresh time it be a source of any cluster

reasons i can think object exists only after the constructor order for the constructor to be dispatched using the virtual table there has to be an existing object with a pointer to the virtual table but how can a pointer to the virtual table exist if the object still use the virtual keyword when you want to declare a somewhat polymorphic but there is nothing polymorphic with constructors constructors job in is to simply put an object data on the memory since virtual tables polymorphism in are all about polymorphic behaviour rather on polymorphic data there is no sense with declaring a virtual

say one big reason and that you can work on a code change you do from a small quick fix to a big new will be an issue in or or the one you means the tracking system must be easy to simple and so otherwise developers will hate associate every change to the and you get full traceability for diff miss it if you have better project better release management and so can link each on your scm to a if your scm can do create a branch for each which is even what you get is every change will be or at least linked to the right you use you can promote things always working on stable reducing mainline corruption making it if you deciding which tasks integrate and which ones hold until the next individually run tests on changes before and so	
say that explorer does the copying to the destination files so no way to directly write the destination this makes because the names of the source files can only come from the application that copied the data to the which need not be otoh the names of the destination files may actually because files of the same name could already exist in the destination and only explorer can create the modified names for the destination files by prepending of or by appending to the base file will need to provide the clipboard format for the windows explorer so that it can paste the the of standard clipboard suggests that is the right with this clipboard format you would provide a list of source file but the files do need to exist of so you need to save them to could try to make the process as as usually when a user copies data to the clipboard it is put there whether or not it will be used for a paste for your application that would mean that you would need to create the files and put the list of file names into the every windows does support a mode called which is used exactly for such basically you put only an empty stub of the data onto the and only when another application tries to access the data it will be requested from your so you could implement this in a way that only when the user tries to paste the files into explorer you would save them to disc and return the list of file

see the problem in my copy of safari 4 though not exactly sure what issue you would be having since the sidebar on the right is empty and so not sure how i could tell if its being perhaps you should clarify about the exact problem that order to debug the and either solve it yourself or ask a more specific you should try to strip the problem down to the minimal example necessary to see the remove all of the content and structure that is not relevant to the and ensure the problem still remove all of the css that is not relevant to the and ensure that the problem still then you should have a simple with no more than about 10 lines each of html and if you strip it down far you may find your problem in the process removing one of the lines of css makes your problem go then found the and if not the have something that someone else will be able to give you better advice on without having to wade through all of the extraneous you are still having trouble figuring out going you should try the web inspector in in safari 4 you can go to the and choose develop menu in menu i recall when exactly this preference was but in earlier versions of you should be able to follow to enable the once you have done you should be able to right click if you have a right mouse and choose to bring up the web in more recent versions of you should also be able to choose web from the develop this will show you a lot of information on your css and how the metrics on the elements which should help you debug the

seems like there are actually a few different issues here that should be the fundamental problem is trying to come up with a mechanism that allows an arbitrary object to be inserted in to an existing list at some point in the middle of that describe what the imetadataprovider interface actually looks but it should have some way to uniquely identify a provider option would be to use a the benefit over using the class name is that it allows you to rename the classes as needed during without affecting custom providers as long as you keep the guid the than using a simple list you should probably derive your own providerlist exposes a way for a custom provider to itself from that these mechanisms need to be smart enough to know how to insert the new provider in to the middle of the chain but also smart enough to know how to handle multiple custom providers which have been the removal process needs to be smart as well to deal with similar concerns and also ensure that someone try to remove one of your good approach here would probably be to pass the guid of the provider you want to be inserted after as a parameter to the the method would likewise take the guid of the provider to be say i insert a new provider after then another 3rd party also installs a new provider after what should the new chain order does the second provider always insert immediately after movieproviderfromxml or does it start there and then skip past any custom providers and insert after the last custom provider installed just before the next to that question is the idea that you need to have some way to distinguish between your providers and a custom you need to make sure there is a way to handle failures in the particularly when a custom provider is inserted in the wrong do want to always maintain a base list of your default when a new provider is installed in the middle of that a new chain should be created but you want to loose the base this gives you the ability to reset the chain back to the default based on priority is problematic in that you then have to determine how to handle priority as far as a attribute would you allow both on the same probably so it might make more sense to create a providerchainattribute that has a chaininsert enum where chaininsert defines before and after as enum this allows you to force the custom provider to make a decision as to whether it installs before after the specified i would still use a guid rather than the this gives you some other ideas on how to approach this

solution has its use think the first solution is good if trying to define a relationship as a simple especially if you need to use the key as a lookup second solution feels the most robust to me in and probably use it if i need a fast lookup so you to depend on anyone to know that the key is the id of the object comes is better for passing the instead of two and you just pass is a rare but key values may not be valid as for i to map string to but since a valid variable name i had the second easily in case along the line you need to more data to some i know about your but this is third would be good if you need fast lookup time some of the advantages listed above the data if you need the fast lookup a lot more either you run the risk of error if the id in the object somehow varies from the id in

split the modules necessarily need to have the same dependencies as the others just necessary to do if you break things up you can have libraries without cyclic the issue with using multiple libraries is that by swig declares its runtime code and as a as problems passing objects from one module to you need to enable a shared version of the swig runtime the documentation web page documentation link is runtime functions are private each that the runtime functions are with linkage and are only to the wrapper functions in that the only problem this approach is that when more one swig module is used in the those modules often to share type this especially true for programs swig must collect and information about relationships that cross out that section in your downloaded documentation the swig runtime and give you details on how to enable this so that objects can be properly handled when passed from one module to the not worked with python but have done tcl

than using ilmerge to combine the dlr and ironruby since the source to both is available and you could just compile them into the same dll which would be a lot thing be careful about is that ironruby is still alpha and it would be incredibly risky to run a production service using only in the last 6 months or so that the have started getting packaged up prior to which it was do it yourself builds from in the 18 months or so i have been using ironruby the interfaces and even assembly names changed i would expect things to be stabilisng have an experimental server running that utilises a slightly older version of ironruby and that version has a significant memory i worked around it by automatically restarting the service every 24 things have probably improved since know about the legal side of things but probably a similar approach to siverlight where the beta licenses explicilty forbid commerical applications and permitted only development once sl was formally release the license changed to allow commerical products to be built on top of on the other hand is production ready and i have had good experiences using it on a production service for the last two

that and paste is not actually despite the the act of is figuring out how something should and what code is needed to make that when you copy and paste some it is someone else who did the this a bad thing as you always need to write code but to call yourself a you do need to have written the code will want to start try to write a large complex application as your first step into there is a good reason why most people who are taught programming are first taught how to print this is because there is a lot more that you will need to know than just what code to use you need to know where code execution starts and how it and that sort of you need to be able to look at the code and step through it knowing where program execution will go so you understand how it will a tutorial or course in there is so much free stuff do not trust any tutorial that just gives you large chunks of make sure it forces you to actually come up with some code do exercises such as sorting calculating fibonacci and the and or the learn about conditional statements and the loop and play with these to do various or forms programming is more make sure you know the fundamentals of the language before you go looking through any api or framework documentation to see what the language can need to know how execution how to write what types of variables you can use etc before you can effectively use an api or framework it is boring not being able to do cool graphics or forms and sticking to basic text or number but you have to walk before make sure you are not just when you learn about something new like the array the try it by actually doing a lot faster than just reading a book or website and you may be more likely to remember books about some people say you should learn c before you learn anything i necessarily but if you do learn c then the book to read is c programming by kernighan and many programming books are very interesting but either not suitable for or going to teach you how to actually begin this one is an a decent text editor with syntax highlighting and line all you should a big ide that also does code completion and the like is not necessarily helpful at the learning spend too long choosing one or setting it if you already have just get on and be done with if you like it you can change it once you get more or if already paid for microsoft visual studio then use but go out and get it just for the sake of learning a avoid falling into the trap of spending all your time sharpening your tools and no time using

the only makes sense in the context of its then it should be returned nested within its for in an element make sense as a sub resource on its if a resource can stand and you are going to want to manipulate a resource independent of any other then it should have its own that you can post or put to that resource without affecting other related and without having to parrot them back to the if you had to manipulate everything from the think about what happens if one person does a modifies one and then does a put of the whole thing with that what if someone else changed one of the others in the then you need to be adding locks and transactional which defeats the whole statelessness of get requests at it is likely to be a good idea to have some form of bulk query by which a client can get a large number of resources at having to do a new http request for each resource can take a long since it means a new round trip over the network for each it may make sense to have bulk update functionality as but if you are going to want to be able to manipulate one resource at a you need to provide a uri for that one perfectly fine to have more than one way to access you can think of it like a you can get stories on the main or on archive or by going to their if you want to to a bulk update without running into the problem of having one client give stale data to the you basically have two one client tells the server want a lock on this whole set of fetches the data it wants to modifies the sends it back to the and unlocks the client downloads the set of which is marked with some sort of revision tag which the server changes every time it gets new the client modifies and sends it back to the if any of the other data in the set has been modified in the the revision tag will be out of and the server will respond with a your data is out of try each have advantages and the problem with locking is that it is and so fit into a rest architecture very if the client program crashes or otherwise dies while it has the then that data will be permanently locked unless you have some kind of lock which can get locking can also lead to deadlock if the clients are doing some kind of fancy transactions that involve multiple problem with optimistic concurrency is that if there is a high load on a data with a lot of clients changing it at it can take many tries before a given client can post its in a slow client may end up being completely cut off from posting updates because other clients continually change the data in ways that mean that the slow clients changes always need to decide for yourself which of these options suit these issues also come up when changing a single resource update may clobber but when you aggregate resources into a bulk they are going to come up a lot more why i would recommend having two if going to aggregate one in which the resources can be accessed and an optional bulk interface where many resources can be read and written at

the technical difference between using a tag and tracking a revision is i find myself minimizing tag use based on how implementation is simply a cheap copy and clutters up your real difference comes when a particular baseline to a large team of revision tracking brings an extra layer of abstraction that can become a source of and as all when dealing with any source of error will become an area of confusion and wasted a verbose tag can eliminate that confusion and remove any doubt as to what a purpose

there is an important semantic difference between the really semantic or both iterable they both work with a for difference is for example important when one wants to loop multiple does this ever come have to be more in the rare cases when you need to make two passes through an iterable there are often better say processing a you can iterate through a list all you why did you get tangled up with an iterator instead of the okay that reading a file in two and you need to know how to reset the in this a and is or a close and a that feels you can to get a list which allows two passes with no so not what if we have a file so big we read it all into for obscure we what down to the of two on the first we accumulated an index or a summary or an index has all the a is a restructuring of the with a small change from to preserved the data in the new in both we need the file we can use the index or the algorithms can be changed to one pass of the original iterator or iterable and a second pass of a different data is neither lybl or this is algorithm you need to reset an iterator an example of an simply a i in print i in print is trivially i in print i in print times in is trivially write an api that an and when someone refuses to read the api documentation or refuses to follow it after having read their stuff as it to safeguard against the case were a user provides only an iterator when multiple passes are are both examples of insane people writing code that breaks our simple someone is insane enough to read most not all of the api and provide an iterator when an iterable was you need to find this person and teach them how to read all the api documentation and follow the api issue very these crazy programmers are remarkably and in the few cases when it does know who they and can help have to read the same structure multiple algorithms are a fundamental not do element in element element in element element in element element consider something like element in for f in element most this kind of of your algorithms results in a program that might be easier to optimize and might be a net improvement in	
there is no default you can observe what resolutions have your clients and take average is tip for you if you develop app for a just go there and take info about and if you have need to design app only for one resolution make sure that company will be ok to have all computers set to this in not able to but sometimes it can be when your app is so specific and rare and computers are bought only for this one and only like how to handle different use and properties available mostly in every these days gui application development you will use controls will naturally scale to size of a screen and your controls will no longer go behind corners of your there is no restriction to build app for a resolution you nowadays app i think can assume that res is and when it overlaps like you describe on 800x600 just bother yourself to implement fancy logic to handle this user will catch fast that he needs to change res to higher

things being and in the most simple which is a call to a web service method a call to a assume that you have a simple web service that just returns an integer that is calculated in x you also have a database when queried in th right also takes x time to calculate the the time is the same in both in both assume the amount of data both directions is the a single for the calculation times of both the web service and the database are exactly the environment is 1 application where the app and 1 other server that is holding both the web service and the there is nothing else going on in the environment other than the application calling either the web service or database all within one single so any network latency is an which will be the call to the or the call to the web i am trying to i is which is more does the set tear down of a database connection end up slower than that for a web or is it the if there are other such as parsing the result from a web how do they affect the is the speed difference between database and web service

think know how to do this in but having syntax trouble in because i need to take advantage of the event have different events that i somehow need stored in a property of an attribute just add an attribute to a property linking to the corresponding readonly property as return end need to be events so that other programmers can use the handles keyword on delegate sub sender as byval e as event e as sub handles properties are already raising a general which i am determining the related property and thus getting the related attribute i want to then raise the event i just use a delegate tied to the particular event that raise other handlers will also want to avoid having to write a sub for each property that just uses raise event on the event type if possible as this seems event e as sub sender as byval e as raiseevent readonly property as return end and invoke an event	
think looking for a method like static var enum1 var enum2 while yield return but it should do the job note that particularly useful about this method is that full it can take two sequences of arbitrary types and return objects of any solution of course assumes that you want to compare the nth item of with the nth item in if you want to do match the elements in the two sequences based on a particular then want to perform some sort of operation suggested by danbruc using do let me know if it neither of these approaches is quite what after and maybe i can suggest something an example of how you might use the method with the comparer function you originally prints out to the console all the results returned by the comparer function in this results element in

think there are better alternatives to option which allows this other developer to check in temporary or experimental code is to have using a language that supports have worked at places where every coder had their own matching their which they could use for things that only they were interested eventually when the code was ready for the checks were instance you might this code is code goes here i think there are sometimes cases when the incremental you want to make record does not function well enough to enable for in such the is alternative is to locally use a dvcs like mercurial to track your then when you get to a stable for the you push those changes out to the be careful of submitting too much at	
think there are events called onrefresh or you can know when the page is but knowing why where the user is going is outside security the only way to know whether the page has been reloaded is to know where the user was on the last page which is also outside the scope of you can sometimes get that via but it relies on the security settings to permit access to that	
think there are many gotchas to this approach over the usual problems of running a script from a compiled i find the biggest problems tend to be people from moving the sure people add hidden dependencies in the script that are not reflected in the calling i do think you should consider another model for your instead of having a program reference a why not add all of the logic into a compiled this can be easily linked into the program and exposed to powershell via a i find this is an easier way to maintain shared code between scripts in

think there can be any specific learning c does for you is give you an a broadening of the into how computers a very abstract thing make you write better code in it just makes you more of a computer reference that wedge made to article mentioning shlemiel the painter is an interesting one but has no relevance that algorithm is not tied to c in any particular way it manifests itself in strings are immutable and completely different from model of so i quite see the suppose one concrete example is optimizing a parser or a lexer or a program that keeps writing to a string buffer all the if you use normal strings instead of a string run across a problem when you build very large a a copy of both and it change the string that was referenced by it creates a new allocating more becomes considerably and you keep adding small things to then shlemiel the painter will manifest then knowing this has nothing to do with knowing just knowing how your language implements things at the low is where having an experiece in c will help

think using design patterns in names is a for example in one of my games i second two classes and subclass gamelevelabstract and implement pure virtual i can see in my source view that that class is abstract and immediately know it is or what looking example is my graphics the same setup as i had except that it deals with find using the design pattern in the name to be useful and informative when i am looking for a i do believe that some things should not be used in the name such as however factory or facade are examples of design names i think fit well in the name of a class that implements those think that if you use good class names that help the programmer get a good grasp of what your class does at a glance is a good think that stating something is a data structure or an algorithm is a good thing in most or add anything to the understanding of the class as is obvious in	
think using generics here is cleaner than just doing the cast from form but not the the problem is that the value being returned of the right a and you cast from to or assuming you actually want to parse you should return a string from form b and form a should use or handling user input error is assuming that returns text such as or not immediately clear to me that the

think you probably made a poor naming i would think would be a subclass of not the other way so use as the you upcast an to a your reference will only be able to access methods declared in if you downcast it back to an have access to all of the since java objects know what type they really anything that actually is an can always be cast back to no matter what type of reference you are using an there is unavoidable and part of the you could hide it behind some sort of but in your case that probably defeats the in all methods are virtual by this means that if overrides some method declared in then the version will be even if you access it through a if you need to invoke the parent class you can make a call by calling you probably use this very often least of the reasons being that it breaks	
think you want to use find instead of each least for the specified closures directly support the groovy actually use a closure either for it uses a for you could write your own enhanced version of iterator that takes a conditional test and another closure to call if a match is having it break if a match is an workclosure for iter def value if a println on prints on	
thinking about this for a i came to the conclusion that probably a bad idea to do asynchronous events in windows forms windows forms events should be raised on the ui doing otherwise presents an undue burden on and possibly makes a mess with objects and asynchronous cleaner to let the clients fire off their own asynchronous processing or some other or handle the event are of for raises the event on a thread pool but the initial notification comes in on a pool it looks like the general rule raise the events on the same thread that got the initial at the rule that works best for that way no question about leaking

this actually a strange as it might of the type of a constructor instance method field m of a type c that is not inherited from superclasses or superinterfaces is erasure of its type in the declaration corresponding to type of a static member of a raw c is the same as its type in generic declaration corresponding even though the type signature use any type parameters of the class type erasure kicks in and the signature becomes effectively map other i think you can imagine a raw type as being the same api as the generic type but with all bits removed from the not the this unchecked new map unchecked s2 because an implicit but unchecked conversion from the raw type to you can get the same effect by making an explicit conversion does nothing at execution in the last but with an unchecked x

to would be my short answer recommendation to combine the 2 values as it will maintain the distribution shape as you mentioned and should solve the problem of combining the the distribution of the 2 variables is different which sounds likely this really give you what i think your which is a combined measure of where each variable is within its given you would have to come up with a metric which determines where in the given distribution the value this could be done many one of which would be to determine how many standard deviations away from the mean the given value you could then combine these 2 values in some way to get your may no longer be have to work out what makes the most sense for the data sets your looking standard deviations may well be meaningless for your but you need to look at statistical measures that related to the distribution and combine rather than combing absolute normalized or

undergraduate project dealt with transcribing notes from a wav file to a midi we handled only the simple case of one possibly playing more than one note at a time for our research into the subject before we started showed that even only one is considered the problem what frequencies are playing at any given this can be done by a of small windows one at a some heuristic to guess which frequencies are harmonies of the same and which belong to different this be easy if you know what instrument is but hard in the general because the magnitudes of each harmony differ by for you might have two cs one octave apart from one or you might have one c but from a different you know what notes are playing at each you have to guess when you have breaks in the you could have one long note or a series of short depending on the size of the windows you used for the initial you could have different results if you have more than one instrument at a and no two are playing the same notes or harmonies thereof at one you be able to tell the instruments apart using some heuristic on the magnitudes of the harmonies or on the sequences of notes most likely there will be times when two instruments are playing the same then you really have any way to decide if there is one instrument playing the two instruments playing at the same one playing soft and the other playing loud or any combination the short list of problems to i know of any algorithm that solves this in the general i think this problem has been solved my project presentation can be found at

update statement one that changes will hold locks regardless of the isolation level and whether you have explicitly defined a transaction of you can control is the granularity of the locks by using so if the update is locking the entire then you can specify a query hint to only lock the affected rows that is unless your query is updating the whole table of to answer your the first connection to request locks on a resource will hold those locks for the duration of the you can specify that a select does not hold locks by using the read uncommitted isolation statements that change data always hold locks the next connection to request locks on the same resource will wait until the first has finished and will then hold its dead locking is a specific scenario where two connections are holding locks and each is waiting for the other to avoid the engine waiting one connection is chosen as the deadlock

upon a time i hand wrote a tiny installer which analysed the version of windows and then downloaded the appropriate installer for the seem to see that approach is widespread use these days than the majority of the time whenever been in a position to have to develop an installer for a been done with installaware or another alternative reality is that the cost of maintaining and supporting a bespoke installer can be quite especially with each new os released and a lot of that cost can be offset by purchasing or investing in one of these commercial products said many of the installers can be quite one specific product required the use of installshield pro just so we could script out custom actions in if you have something which requires a fair bit of intricate install hard to suggest an off the shelf installer package it can be more of a nightmare in upgrade scenarios if going to support your own custom do yourself a favour and budget a lot of money and testing to and make sure you factor in patching installs with or without administrative unattended multiple language support in the and so it can get very very

upsizing a backend ms access database to sql the client will remain an access application for the time being about 30k lines of aim is to eventually allow synchronisation of the database accross multiple servers using replication but probably the sync all primary keys in the access tables are autoincrement integer not asking about the process of upsizing but about whether i should use guid or another codification for the pk know i could split the number range accross but i want to do that and allow the pk to be created on the client if for instance in offline assured easy to manipulate in especially when using them as filters for subforms or in insert performance due to their more than one canonical binary that need to be codification thought that maybe a scheme using a more uniform code as pk would avoid the performance penalty most ensure that the pk remains usable in form controls where necessary not require these conversions idea for a codification scheme would be along the lines of a 10 character code split digits for a digits for a unique client digits as a random number for potential digit would be in base composed of letters from and avoiding because of their similitude case we need to manually handle these for instance during to handle manually when the case require conversion between different representation since basically a string less existing code to assured in join been in insert should be faster than guid but not machine must be set its own although that should not be too much of an should i use guid or another scheme for my custom codification scheme instead of guid as primary

way for a small dump your database to sql and add it to your then every time you change add the changes in the dump can then use diff to see changes between not to mention have comments explaining your this will also make you virtually immune to mysql one downside seen to this is that you have to remember to manually add the sql to your you can train yourself to always but be careful if you work with missing an update could be a pain later could be mitigated by creating some elaborate script to do it for you when submitting to subversion but a bit much for a one man in the year gone by since this had to implement a versioning scheme for mysql for a small manually adding each change was seen as a cumbersome much like it was mentioned in the so we went with dumping the database and adding that file to version we found was that test data was ending up in the dump and was making it quite difficult to figure out what had this could be solved by dumping the schema but this was impossible for our projects since our applications depended on certain data in the database to eventually we returned to manually adding changes to the database only was this the simplest but it also solved certain issues that some versions of mysql have with normally we would have to dump the development remove any test log certain names where applicable and only then be able to create the production by manually adding changes we could control exactly what would end up in a little at a so that in the end everything was ready and moving to the production environment was as painless as

would like to ask about your suggestions concerning unit testing against large want to write unit tests for an application which is mostly implemented in so mocking the database is not an database is quite large so restoring the database after a test run is also practically purpose is to manage the handling of applications for credit there are users in specific roles that change the state of objects and my job is to test part of this considering two agreements that meet specific conditions and then test changes of agreement state transition from waiting in some office to handled in this specific the agreements will be created in application itself and they will be my test all the tests will be in transactions that would be rolled back after performing these advantage of this approach is quite straightforward expected data could be easily described because i exactly know how the object should look like after the disadvantage is that the database cannot change in a way that will break the users and agreements used in test cases must always look the same and if there will be a need to change the database the preparation process will have to be agreements in unit programatically create agreements that would meet specific the data used for creating agreement will be chosen also the users that will change agreement state will be created advantage of this approach is ease of making changes to objects and ability to run tests on databases with different objects and have lots of fields and related data and afraid it would take some time to implement creation of these objects also afraid that these objects may contain some errors because the creation method will be quite hard to implement without do you think about these two any stack overflow readers think it is worth the effort create objects as described in second anyone here have any experience creating such testing against large

would like to populate a is what i have in db book you may know a treeview is made up of treenode treenode object have a text property and a tag property is the text that display on the screen for this node and the is an value uses to identify a in my the fields ending with id will be used in the property and the fields ending with name will be used in the for a i will use the bookid field for the property and bookname field for the i use a dbml so i have a book box object and chapter object and i use linq to get them from the my question what is the best practice to build this have a solution but really ugly because it looks like duplicating the problem is that the values i need to extract for the text and tag properties are identified by differents fields name in the for the book i need to get the bookid field to populate the tag property of my for the box i need to get the boxid field to populate the tag property can i make a kind of generic way to do it hope i made myself clear hesitate to ask me questions in practice treeview populating from differents kinds of

would start by collecting some performance metrics on the build on whatever system you currently use to i would specifically look at cpu and memory the amount of data read and written from and the amount of network traffic on windows you can use perfmon to get all of this on you can use tools like iostat and figure out where the bottlenecks are is your build cpu disk starved for the answers to these questions will guide your purchase decision if your build hammers the cpu but generates relatively little putting in a screaming raid disk is a waste of may want to try running your build with varying levels of parallelism as you collect these metrics as if using run your build with and this will help you see if the build is cpu or disk consider the possibility that the right build server for your needs might actually be a cluster of cheap systems rather than a single massive box there are lots of distributed build systems out there that can help you leverage an array of cheap computers better than you could a single big	
would store a relative path in the this gives you the greatest loading images is a simple matter of prepending an variable should probably be to get the filesystem this is important because you might want to move where the images are stored them on a faster for then it is simply changing the configurable putting a reference to the image into a put the full this is simply adding a to the relative this gives you the advantage of being able to easily switch servers if you find load requires dedicated servers for serving	
would sugest using regular at first i would split into sections with the following split each section into match the three possible subsection you must analyze range type it is a matter of parsing the extracted strings into numbers and adding them into putted everything together into a small console application that does the it is far from perfect no error no just parsing a demo i merged some of the expressions mentioned before to get the code compacter and probably class static void string input match sections foreach section in match subsections foreach subsection in match subsectionparts if decimal start decimal end decimal step if end if step decimal current while current to allow things like using decimal instead of single or numbers in the input are decimal numbers and cannot be represented by single or double because they use a base 2 so for represented by the single value x i i x programm will print after only 8 after 1000 iterations the error grows to displaying instead of and after one million iterations the result is instead of are no such errors for because decimal uses a base 10 representation and is able to exactly represent decimal numbers like

would think the best option is to let the php script first set a flag in the session array to indicate that it is processing a that way a second request can be set to wait until the original request has completed a sleep call server side waiting for the flag to is important not to interfere too much with the submit button and because the nature of the web is one of the user may want to click a second time if no answer has and you want to lose their that could occur if the first request is lost and you have disabled their only way to submit therefore the cleaner solution is to submit the and use javascript to display a message saying so that the user can see that something is but they are not prevented from the

would use a to get the values of the function into the and then the ranking like over by as as inner join on where is null or like and is null or group as you wanted only a certain section of results for then you would need another and then filter on the row over by as as inner join on where is null or like and is null or group as as between 1 and that in this you could put anywhere in the select since you are no longer reliant on using the by syntax for the order by is a subtle issue here when calling this query multiple it is not guaranteed that the order in which the records are returned are going to be consistent if the number of items in each group is not in order to address you have to change the function to order on the fields that make up the group in the this it would be a and resulting over by as as inner join on where is null or like and is null or group as as between 1 and ends up ordering the results consistently between calls when the count of the items between groups is not unique the same set of

writing an app that basically uses 5 business b d and has some properties and holds a list of has some other properties and a list of and a list of has some other properties and a list of and a list of has only a few has only a few is no inheritance between any of no real business logic the objects are and then accessed no further natural coding style would be to go object oriented and write classes for each of those use nsarrays for the and have the mentioned properties would make the code another approach seems obvious only use nsdictionaries and and working with instead of this seems more and somehow to programming to but obviously leads to less readable another advantage is no additional custom for serialization required state to using on the it speaks for the latter on the other it still feels somehow awkward not to use custom this really just matter of taste or are there maybe other arguments in one of the is only using dictionaries better is it the preferred coding coming from custom objects with your	
writing an application in python that requires me to use a dictionary as a data am curious as to whether or not it is more memory efficient to have one large or to break that down into many smaller then have an dictionary that contains a reference to all the smaller know there is a lot of overhead in general with lists and i read somewhere that python internally allocates enough space that the of items to the power of new enough to python that not sure if there are other unexpected internal like that is not apparent to the average user that i should take into of the difficulties is knowing how the power of 2 system counts is each counted as 1 seems important to know because if you have a 100 item monolithic dictionary then space items would be if you have 100 single item dictionaries then each dictionary would only be allocation no extra clearly laid out information would be very one large dictionary or a dictionary of smaller

wrote a c program in which i did some pretty heavy stack around 2 since i use the poor i was automatically running the program via make in order to test each time i had pretty much wrapped everything but for some during some of the final i ran it directly from the instant running it with make still and running it by hand always produced the same eventually reduced the amount of stack allocation i was doing to 256 which solved the my rational was that make was probably the and thus it was inheriting some weird parameters that allowed it to use more stack everything is fine i have no way of testing my can anyone confirm or or suggest some way of and some nutty runs when launched by but not via shell crazy	
wrote quite complex shell scripts and my first suggestion is the reason is that is fairly easy to make a small mistake that hinders your or even make it i have other resources to pass you but my personal is what i normally which is but tends to be although your script accept long and short be careful because there are two commands to parse getopt and use getopt as you face less bash test echo exit set case shift shift echo unparseable option option exit test echo missing exit important point is that a program should always return zero if completes if something went can call functions in just remember to define them before the functions are like they can only return numeric this means that you have to invent a different strategy to return string my strategy is to use a variable called result to store the and returning 0 if the function completed you can raise exceptions if you are returning a value different from and then set two exception and the first containing the exception type and the second a human readable you call a the parameters of the function are assigned to the special vars i suggest you to put them into more meaningful declare the variables inside the function as foo local prone unless you declare an unset variable is used as an empty this is very dangerous in case of as the badly typed variable will not be and it will be evaluated as prevent this to be careful because if you do the program will abort every time you evaluate an undefined for this the only way to check if a variable is not defined is the test echo not can declare variables as can achieve modularization if you use the following getscriptabsolutedir used to get the script the script local local absolute path if the first character is a if test importer routine to get external the first location searched is the script if not search the module in the paths contained in environment the file to without if test echo unable to import unspecified exit if test echo undefined script absolute did you remove exit if test echo empty script exit if test import from script elif test import from the shell script library save the separator and use the local for path in if test restore the standard echo unable to find module exit can then import files with the extension with the following will be searched in as you always import in the global remember to prefix all your functions and variables with a proper otherwise you risk name i use double underscore as the python put this as first thing in your avoid double test return oriented you cannot do object oriented unless you build a quite complex system of allocation of objects thought about but you can however do oriented you have one instance of each and only i do i define an object into a module the modularization then i define empty vars to member an init function and member like in this example avoid double test return an example for module enum used in the mysql in this prefixed with bash variable cannot start with will contain the executed mysql command init the module with the database the mysql config if test already return local i am aware that i could put default parameters and other but i am lazy if test parameter config return mark the module as return gets the name of the person the row the if test not return if test parameter return local name from table where id if test 0 to perform return return and handling found this useful to catch and handle signal handler for echo signal handler for echo signal handler for end of the program or probably redundant we already call the cleanup in catch signals and exit int term and something does not work for some try to reorder the order is important and not always not even consider working with it does not support and horrible in it although please if you have to use the kind of things i wrote it means that your problem is too complex to be solved with use another i had to use it due to human factors and

you are generics adds type safety to your which means the compiler can detect if you are putting the wrong type of objects into your thing i would like to point out is that although it removes the visible casting and the source the jvm still does the casting in the way generics is implemented in java it just hides the casting and still produces an still is an of objects in the the good thing about this is that it keeps the bytecode compatible with earlier the bad thing is that this misses a huge optimization

you are truly doing there is no practical difference between a class and a struct except the default member visibility classes have private visibility by default while structs have public visibility by the following are unsigned int unsigned int unsigned int unsigned int point you need the you can simply initialize the struct object with a unsigned long unsigned char long length default constructor replaces unsigned destructor to avoid memory delete few things to in use new instead of taken some liberty and changed bitlength to if this class represents a network be much better off dealing with bytes instead of bits my the data array is an array of unsigned not unsigned this is based on my assumption that this class represents a network the constructor allows you to create a packet like default packet with data packet with data destructor is called automatically when the packet instance goes out of scope and prevents a memory	
you are using memory management garbage you should use in you should the same use instead of to allocate the this allocates memory for the instances in a specified memory zone developers might use a separate zone if they are going to allocate objects which will be no longer needed at roughly the same the entire zone can then be reclaimed in one operation with helping to prevent memory in using a private zone is not needed will generally hurt profile your assuming the developer wants a copy in a particular i think you would assume they would want all related instances in the same and methods call the and methods passing the default

you have a table rules with 3 columns and as data enters the i want to know if any row of the rules table matches my data with the condition that if the corresponding column in the rules table is all data the obvious sql from or a is and or b is and or c is if i have a b 50 null 51 xyz 51 null null xyz input of will match rules 1 and is there a better way to do with only 3 fields this is no but the actual table will have 15 columns and i worry about how well that sql an alternative sql statement i came up with involved adding an extra column to the table with a count of how many fields are not in the this columns value for rules is 2 and 2 with this the select could from when a then 1 else 0 when b then 1 else 0 when c then 1 else 0 i have enough sample data to find our which of these approaches would perform before i start creating random i thought ask here whether there was a better data mining techniques and column constraints are not feasible the data must be checked as it enters the system and so it can be flagged the users control the addition or removal of rules so i convert the rules into column constraints or other data definition last in the end i need a list of all the rules that the data fails to the solution cannot abort at the first there a good way to check rules against n

you look at your those two blocks are very i bet they can be refactored into a single that sound like an it i think in general if you feel the desire to use braces like you are dealing with a situation that would be better handled by factoring out another method or refactoring pieces general once i got good at oo and limiting how much work i do in a single never thought they might be a good with code that it must be fairly easily try a sorry if i get the syntax i really do and java have i know output is it is in the example as var var you never said where source came var items p getcontent may need to be passed you say where those calls came see comments return like this save much but they show up some great as the relationship between foosource and transforma possibly the getcontent is a decent chance that they should be stored in a single object and that object should be passed or something hard to tell from this often refactoring requires a much wider view of the code than you that they also force you to think about getfoocontent and bet you a pint of beer that these are so similar that they could either be factored into a single method call with a variable or two passed in or into a method in two sibling of the way this kind of relationship always shows up and always improves other code in your i believe these kind of refactors are absolutely doing this kind of refactoring more than anything taught me real

you use a language with garbage collection you wont get access to the memory rather you are given access to some abstraction on top of that one of the things that is properly abstracted away is the the actual location in memory of the data as well as pointers to other when the garbage collector runs happens it will check if you still hold a reference to each of the memory blocks it has allocated for if you it will free that main difference between the different types of garbage collectors is their efficiency as well as any limitations on what kind of allocation schemes they can simplest is properly reference when ever you create a reference to an object an internal counter on that object is when you chance the reference or it is no longer in the counter on the target object is when this counter reaches the object is no longer referred at all and can be problem with reference counting garbage collectors is that they cannot deal with circular if object a has a reference to object b and that in turn has some or reference to object they can never be even if none of the objects in the chain are refereed outside the chain therefore accessible to the program at mark and sweep algorithm on the other hand handle the mark and sweep algorithm works by periodically stopping the execution of the mark each item the program has allocated as the program then runs through all the variables the program has and marks what they point to as if either of these allocations contain references to other data in the that data is then likewise marked as is the mark part of the at this point the program can no matter how is marked as reachable and everything the program reach is marked as the garbage collector can now safely reclaim the memory associated with the objects marked as problem with the mark and sweep algorithm is that it that efficient the entire program has to be stopped to run and a lot of the object references going to improve on the mark and sweep algorithm can be extended with so called garbage in this mode objects that have been in the system for some number of garbage collections are promoted to the old which is not checked that improves efficiency because objects tend to die young of a string being changed inside a resulting in perhaps a lifetime of a few hundred or live very long objects used to represent the main window of an or the database connection of a more detailed information can be found on based on the mark and sweep algorithm well as any other garbage collection algorithm except reference the garbage collection do run in the context of your since it has to be able to access stuff that your program is not capable of accessing therefore it is not correct to say that the garbage collector runs on the
