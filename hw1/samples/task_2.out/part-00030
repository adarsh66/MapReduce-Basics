a default sql server listens on by this can be on a named unless configured sql server listens on a dynamic tcp what that means is should sql server discover that the port is in it will pick another tcp how clients usually find the right port in the case of a named instance is by talking to the sql server listener that listens on and cannot be if you have a named you can configure a static port and if you have a need to use kerberos you need to determine is what port your sql server is listening then need to get with your folks to determine if they allow communication to that port via if they as check your firewall some systems have multiple firewalls laptop is an if need to check all the firewalls on your all of those are verify the server have an ipsec policy that restricts access to the sql server port via ip that also could result in you being brian

a tree is just a special type of graph called a directed acyclical so first and depth first traversal both work on a could write out a detailed explanation of the differences between breadth and depth first but probably get it wrong not a heavy guy it to say that the only difference between breadth and depth first traversal is the order in which you process the breadth first you can think of as adding vertices to a depth first you can think of as adding the vertices to a when it comes time to process the vertices been added to their respective data you dequeue or pop the stack to get the next vertex to clever versions of depth first traversal use recursion to process the vertices instead of adding them to a have no idea whether this was helpful or quick google search know whether it was breadth or depth finds which seems pretty good at describing the differences between bfs and i can also recommend steve algorithm design if you want to get a more in depth

a type parameter is one which is allowed to vary down as the class is subtyped vary with hence the more is a subtype of because is a subtype of this means that you may provide an instance of when a value of type is this is really a very intuitive way for generics to but it turns out that it is unsound the type when used in the presence of mutable this is why generics are invariant in brief example of unsoundness using java arrays are erroneously arr new just assigned a value of type to an array of type for reasons which should be this is bad type system actually allows this at compile the jvm will throw an at type system prevents this problem because the type parameter on the class is invariant is rather than that there is another type of variance known as this is very important as it explains why covariance can cause some contravariance is literally the opposite of parameters vary with it is a lot less common partially because it is so though it does have one very important def the variance annotation on the type this declaration as a whole means that is contravariant in and covariant in we can derive the following that must be a subtype the same of whereas it is the opposite for and in this can be read as the function is a subtype of another function if the parameter type of is a supertype of the parameter type of while the return type of is a subtype of the return type of reason for this rule is left as an exercise to the reader think about different cases as functions are like my array example from your knowledge of and you should be able to see why the following example will not def problem is that is while the function expects its type parameter to be is varying the wrong interestingly we could solve this problem by making contravariant in but then the return type would be invalid as the function expects its return type to be only two options here are to make losing the intuitive properties of or add a local type parameter to the method which defines as a lower is now you can imagine that is varying but is able to vary upward with respect to since is its with this method we can have be covariant and everything works that this trick only works if we return an instance of which is specialized on the type if you try to make things break down since you end up trying to assign values of type to a variable of type which is disallowed by the whenever you have you need to have a mutator of some which requires a method parameter of a certain which with the implies covariance works with immutable data since the only possible operation is an which may be given a covariant return

agree with everyone who says automated hardware is a must using that approach to test embedded software with some of our we have built up large test stations full of hardware simulators and we use ni teststand with a mix of labview vendor etc to manage all of we have to test a lot of hardware why we have all of that if just testing software then you can scale it back to the bare testing a serial just build a device to simulate the serial traffic and exercise all of the messages a few to ensure the software responds testing are plenty of usb peripherals or embedded devices to simulate if timing is important have to use another embedded device to get the tight tolerances looking otherwise a pc will do just important part is to always know what testing and not to test anything other than if make sure the test is independent of the hardware to the largest degree if testing waveform generation or something with a separate out the tasks test the hardware with a special build of software on the embedded device that do anything fancy except spit out a prearranged sequence of voltage then you can see if your references are if your filters are set to the wrong then you should be able to test the software independent of the hardware use a development board to test the software and verify behavior at the processor pins is

all in a gui queue are best done by a single thread as there is an implied order in the events thus they need to be done which is why most gui apps have a single thread to handle though potentially multiple events to create them it does not preclude the event thread from creating a job and handling it off to a worker pool on a socket can potentially by done in parallel as each request is stateless and can thus by done independently i know that is over simplifying jobs were each job is independent and placed on this is the classic case of using a set of worker each thread does a potentially long operation independently of the other on completion comes back to the queue for another

alternate approach to the visual comments there is a scheme system and associated book that has been targeted particularly at people like you with some the book to design is available free on the web and printed and the system is open upside of this sort of approach is that it is a nice clean small design with some powerful tools to get you plus a vastly better textual approach that your typical yourself x in y technical downside is that be starting off in a language that while very nicely designed is not and has a different approach that the family and related languages that dominate industry programming so while be learning with a much nicer language you have so many sources of you follow this track probably become a better programmer but be a bit when you do learn a more mainstream language or you make many of the same newbie mistakes as guess it depends a lot what your long and goals

am having a little bit a class design i will outline the three patterns i am public public void com stuff with testobj new public public myobject com stuff with return testobj new using private private public static myobject com stuff with return new testobj main questions one do you think is the better it bad practice to hide the constructor in favor of a static factory am also trying to make this as testable as only reason i seem to make up my mind is because the myobject class is a wrapper around another object in a com problem is that this object has to be declared in the com application which is what the method is doing before any other method can be but if i hide the constructor and then add more work to the declare method i think it will make the rest of the class hard to becuase i have to go through the declare method public constructor or private with static factory and a com

am surprised that so few are mentioning encapsulation here in an instance method will automatically have access to all private properties and in addition to all protected ones inherited from base you write code you should write it so that you expose as little as possible and also so that you have access to as little as it might be important to make your code fast which would happen if making your methods but usually more important then that is to make your code as incapable of creating bugs as possible one way to achieve that is to have your code have access to as little as possible of might seem irrelevant at first glance since the op is obviously talking about refactoring which can not go wrong in this scenario and create any new however this refactored code must be maintained in the future and modified which makes your code have a bigger in regards to new bugs if it has access to private instance so in general i think the conclusion here is that mostly your methods should be unless there are any other reasons for not having them and this simply because use of encapsulation and data hiding and creates

answer is that trivial getters and setters do not merit their own if i add any code other than simple reads or then i add this is all so you could easily write a script that generates unit tests for your getters and if you think any value certain ides may allow you to define a template that creates test cases with test methods filled in for this boilerplate code thinking of intellij but eclipse can probably handle it although i done anything like this in either

answer was very but i was surprised to see that it end with you should ask yourself why you are populating a combo box with duplicate the framework bug no doubt has been allowed to exist because when you use the control as to allow the user to pick an item from a you run into this is the user going to differentiate between the identical why would they choose one over is there a different meaning to the different if then having duplicate entries is which is always bad usability if then you have duplicate only scenario i can think of where this might make sense is when you have a large list consisting of several groups of related where one or more items logically fits into more than one group so you want to display it in both guessing your design account for the fact that there may be multiple identical entries and that this omission will have other usability repercussions that are more significant than this of i understand that you may be doing something i thought of where it totally makes sense to do what in which case you can feel free to ignore my

answer your question as to what is actually going i try to foreach an questions block i get an object not collection each enumerates a set of variants from the source it does this by acquiring an if the source variable holds an object it is expected to have an implementation of this if it is an array vbscript creates an implementation dynamically and it can only do this if the array has been anything else in the source variable as empty in this will result in an the assignment fails with a type mismatch left hand side of an assignment operation must always be a hence its not possible copy the contents of one dynamic array to another via a simple first approach is reasonably sound but you need a way to represent an empty array without crashing out a for you can use this little public public public private sub questions end if you try to for each the questions before it has been assigned a real array the for each will do nothing as also if you use 1 to get the count of questions that will still be accurate since is	
answer your question but it might be easier to use an int32 property in your class and and use a static class of constants like this to handle the values in static class public const int cancomment public const int canedit public const int candelete public const int canremoveusers public const int all cancomment canedit candelete know this is not since it restrict your users to the fixed enum and forces you to deal with raw ints in but i think hibernate will have trouble with a bitwise it will try to map a value in the database back to a specific enum if it finds a value in the database which you have not explicitly enumerated it will probably if it finds a in the it be able to map it back to an enum unless you explicitly enumerate every like this probably defeats the purpose of using the bitwise

append content to a you should only call during the parsing you have a call to somewhere where it executes outside that such as in your event there is no parsing going so nowhere for that string to should happen according to the javascript handlers execute after the original document so the write method implicitly opens a new document of mimetype if you do not explicitly issue a method in the event it assumes made a mistake and meant to replaces the entire document with new also notice that because you finish that off by the throbber is still expecting more content to be written to the document it never this you are a how are you is clearly not a valid html chrome which behaves the is trying to parse it as an html but fails because it is text content outside the document element which is not if you put some tags in the name how are you see everything outside the element is firefox and ie manage to apply their up text outside any to save but chrome you want to a new you should make sure it is indeed a complete how are you if you want to a text you should theoretically the but the mimetype parameter is not supported by chrome or always treat what you write as any probably want to be using this if you want to add to the existing page you should normally be using dom such as setting the text on a status output or replacing the body contents using is needed in a few places when you are creating a new window or frame from but otherwise generally the wrong thing and should be viewed with

because of oo concept of using private you encapsulate the access to your object variable keeping the control of the object not allowing external objects to change the status of your object that you are not simple example would be a pocket class pocket public int numberofcoins private boolean havemoney public void public boolean return now imagine another class as pickpockets public void a simple however this shows how important to have control of the access to your class a more complex object with a much more complicated state encapsulation makes the abstraction and consistency of the object

been running some metrics on my java project and apparently there are a lot of dependency cycles between i really know how to organize stuff into so i just did what made sense to which is apparently project is a neural network neural networks have which are connected to each other with they need to depend on each there are also different types of so i thought be a good idea to put them all in there own obviously a connection a neuron so it be in the but since they refer to each i now have a circular is just an but i have more situations like how do you handle these kinds of i read that classes in a package higher up in the package hierarchy are not supposed to refer to classes in packages that are this would mean that a neuralnetwork class in package can not refer to the neuron in package do you guys follow this and what if i would move neuralnetwork to or in that it would refer to a sibling package instead of a is that better to organize packages prevent dependency

best practices states for performance you should not have more than 2000 items in a you can perfectly well have millions of items in a but you should carefully define your views and use of index columns to only return less than 2000 items at one your list data change often and you have a lot of memory available on the it is worth looking at portalsitemapprovider for querying the info on the various methods to query lists and a full comparative whitepaper can be found

blog discusses the thought behind their latest improvements to the people selector problem they had to overcome was how to parse and otherwise handle so much data all your they tried getting xml and json via but found it too they then had this to say about loading the data via a dynamically generated script tag callback and dynamic script fast but with the theory that string manipulation was the with the last we from using ajax to instead the data using a dynamically script this means that contact data was never treated and was instead executed soon as it was just any other javascript difference in performance 89ms to parse contacts reduction of 3 orders while the smallest case 172 contacts only took the time per contact actually the larger the list approach looked except one in order for this json be we had to wrap it in callback any website in the world use the same approach to download flickr contact this a deal someone please go into the exact security risk here with a sample how is loading a given file via the attribute in a script tag different from loading that file via an ajax issue with dynamic script

came up in another elaborate on my from is an object that can appear in slice for interpretation is purely up to whatever implements the function and sees objects but its main use is in in the which adds a multidimensional array since there are more than one slicing becomes more complex than just a start and stop it is useful to be able to slice in multiple dimensions as given a 4x4 the top left area would be defined by the slice top this ellipsis is used here to indicate a placeholder for the rest of the array dimensions not think of it as indicating the full slice for all the dimensions in the gap it is so for a 3d is the same as and for similarly is however many colons in the middle make up the full number of dimensions in the in the ellipsis literal is usable outside the slice so you can actually than the various numeric i think as far as it was added purely for numpy use and has no core support other than providing the object and corresponding the object being there require but the literal support for slices

certainly not the only but i do hope part of a declining trend problem with hungarian notation is that trying to implement a type system via naming this is extremely problematic because a type system with only human every human on the project has to agree to the same set of do rigorous code reviews and ensure that all new types are assigned the appropriate and correct in impossible to guarantee consistency with a large enough code at the point there is no consistency why are you doing tools support hungarian that might seem like a stupid comment on the surface but consider refactoring for each refactoring in a hungarian naming convention system must be accompanied with a mass rename to ensure that prefixes are mass renames are susceptible to all sorts of subtle of using names to implement a type just rely on the type it has automatic verification and tool newer make it much easier to discover a type hover etc and really remove the original desire for hungarian

changes the element have the following problem explain it simplified because otherwise it would get too need to create an server control that is inherited from simple when the custom control it should dynamically create a associate an event handler to it will also be defined inside the server and add this button to the rendered the click event handler defined inside the server control does some job which for the moment already coded an example and that works in the constructor of the server control i create a new button give it an associate an event on the oninit of the server control i add the button to the panel controls my control inherits from and then everything gets this looks something like the class private button public mybutton new new protected void eventargs protected override void protected override void protected override void protected override void works quite the button gets rendered correctly and when i click on the appropriate handler inside this customer server control is invoked and now the problem however starts when i would like to add multiple instances of this server control to my page because all of my generated buttons will have the same id which results in a so what i tried is to associate a random number to the id of the it end up being or something this solves my problem with the multiple but results in the problem that my event handler when clicking on the button is no more called i guess this is due to the problem that my button always gets another id when entering in the constructor and so the appropriate callback event someone give me a suggestion how i could handle the is there some way for remembering the id of the button and as far as i know however this has to happen in the where the viewstate yet so storing the id in the viewstate server how to handle id of dynamic

compilers are much better at doing straightforward like this across your entire code ensure that you are enabling your compiler by compiling your release version with the right optimization if you use visual you might want to experiment with favoring size over speed are a lot of cases where small code is code generation which enables the compiler to do and maybe even also need to remember that the vast bulk of your code matter from a performance perspective optimizing this code will have no user visible need to define your performance goals early on and measure frequently to make sure meeting when outside of your use tools such as profilers to determine where the hot spots are in your code and optimize another poster without measuring and understanding optimization at all its just random you have measured and determined that a particular function or loop is a there are two approaches to optimize optimize it at a higher level by reducing invocations of the costly this will usually lead to the most algorithm level improvements fall into this level an algorithm will a better should result in running the hotspot code calls cannot be then you should consider look at the actual machine code that the compiler is emitting and determine what it is doing that is the most costly if it turns out copying temporary objects is then consider prefix over if doing an unnecessary comparison at the beginning of the flip the loop into a and so without understanding the code is any blanket are next to

depends on where the code you want to set string1 in is being if it is in some outside class with access to both view controller then if you have viewcontroller1 object and viewcontroller2 object then all you do you want to set string1 from code run within then you use the notification in initialization you string1 in when you want to change the same technique is used when you are changing the string from some third class that has access to vc2 but not viewcontroller1 code is the same as and when you want to change the trickiest part is if you want to change the string from within viewcontroller1 that you have access to the object you have to use two the one and for when you want to change the you think this is too complex or causes too much the simpler solution is to as fields in viewcontroller1 and pointers to one within if you make these fields from the

designing a web application to support use of a cdn in the options domain aliasing for static content on the including and some side to designate static content is simpler and implemented it for we would prefix each img src with and then later update the corresponding dns to use the the drawback heard from users of our internal site is that they would have to push the images to to preview their changes internally files would not get pushed to until ready for hosts file changes and dns tricks are not an option they would like to simply use relative or absolute paths for static is not as familiar to me and i would like more would this allow our team to reference static content with a relative path in and yet have it work with the cdn in production without html someone compare the two in terms of ease of and aliasing vs edge side includes for	
details of the i can only speculate that the web service implementation is throwing a runtime exception that is not an instance of the soapfault or axisfault classes their the default behavior in in a such a would be to deliver the error page in the since web services are servlets after usually indicates that the web service must handle the exceptions appropriately and throw an appropriate soap to prevent the exception from trickling up the call stacktrace would help in establishing the root cause of this but going to shoot in the dark anyway can refer to the issue and see if that is the actual cause of the to put it from the information one can use soap not sure about the fix having been propagated to axiom since i did not see any reference to

each item so random lookup is extremely fast i can instantly say want the 657415671567th and go straight to because we know its memory address will be exactly 657415671567 bigger than the first this has little or no memory overhead in it has no way of automatically resizing you have to create a new copy across all the and then delete the old plain lists are useful when you need to lookup data from anywhere in the and you know that your list will not be longer than a certain item has a reference to the next this means that there is some overhead store the reference to the next because not stored you immediately go to the 657415671567th element you have to start at the head and then get its reference to go to the and then get its to get to the and then get its reference to get to the and then get its reference to get to the in this it is very inefficient for random it allows you to modify the length of the if your task is to go through each item then about the same value as a plain if you need to change the length of the it could be better than a plain if you know the 566th and looking for the then all you need to do is follow the reference to the next if you know the 567th and looking for the the only way to find it is to start searching from the 1st element this is where double linked lists come in linked linked lists store a reference to the previous this means you can traverse the list as well as this could be very useful in some situations as the example given in the linked list other than they have most of the same advantages and disadvantages as a linked from comments use as a have to take all of those advantages and disadvantages into can you say with confidence that your queue will have a maximum if your queue could be anywhere from 1 to 10000000000 elements then a plain list will just waste memory then may not even be big in that go with a linked rather than storing the of the front and you should actually store the a linked list is made up of and each node stores the item as well as the reference to the next you should store a reference to the first and the last when you you stick a new node onto the rear linking the old rear one to the new rear and remember this new rear when you you remove the front and remember the second one as the new that you have to worry about any of the middle you can thus ignore the length of the queue you can store that too if you really

even worse than yuval given a vector x you are looking for a new vector is the which you are probably thinking of as a euclidean norm with are floating point so not enough to just guard against dividing by you also have a floating point issue if the are all small may underflow and you lose the what it all boils down to is that if you really need to be able to handle small vectors have to do some more small and zero vectors make sense in your you can test against the magnitude of the vector and do something that as soon as you start dealing with floating rather than doing things like squaring and then square rooting numbers sums of is problematic at both the large an small ends of the representable doing numerical work correctly over all cases is trickier than it first off the top of my head potential problems with this operation done in a naive components too single component too large square root of max will return this cuts the available magnitudes componentwise by sqrt the ratio of a large component to a small component is too you can effectively lose the small components direction if you

fine folks over at have gnu make for as a native it works but does have a few minor quirks due to a hack that tries to equate a target named with the file the gnuwin32 package does include a nice pdf of the use it on xp alongside gcc from the as well as with several different embedded systems cross compiler mingw also provides a native build of gnu do use cygwin for a couple of in particular one where the vendor provided a working toolchain and build environment hosted in moving it to a native windows shaped build would be prohibitively and would make it harder to accept updates from the you want to use mostly native windows but need to start by running configure on an existing source then take a look at this started as a fork of cygwin by the mingw and it intends to provide a minimal set of tools with a bash shell so that configure can be used on it as complete as but it is a lot lighter will find that the manual for gnu make is mostly you have to keep in mind that the content of a makefile is not written in a single the stuff that defines variables and lays out the dependancy tree is one each line of an action is a miniature shell script that is in the language of the default shell might be rather than on and each command has options and you are comfortable with your build then cygwin might be the path of least but msys is often and there is something to be said for adopting the native tools of the target platform so that you have a sense of how your users see in which case mingw and gnuwin32 are handy resources to know

for functional any time you have a common coding pattern and want to reduce a while ago i wrote a bit on using for functional while making sure functional hesitate to link to my own stuff but i think relevant in this if you have a common how expressions are lovely in pattern matching be too in there are tons of patterns that pop up at a coding using higher order you can make them go as i show in that set of blog my favourite example is the pattern is so common it got turned into a language same thing for those are both trivially represented as higher order and only because support them originally do we need language keywords to support switch your blocks out to use a readerwriter have to write a higher order function perhaps convincing just requires looking at generics aka parametric hardly but a nice functional concept everyone the cute ninject framework work without as expression how fluent get all their that come from oo or imperative the new threading pretty ugly without functional programming has been blessing things like over the last the major advances as are directly from functional why not realise something to it and get more involved in how phrase it to bigger is actually getting people to make the jump in understanding to higher order while quite if never seen it before in your it might be shocking an seems like a lot of people think generics are just for and linq is just embedded what you should do is go through your and find places that are an imperative search for the underlying and use functions to string it together if you find you might settle for just off for example all the foos in this list and remove a 1 line thing in functional style versus 7 lines in style a temp loop through and add loop though and remove the hope is even though the syntax is people will recognize a lot if they can put down the more and looks for a have a

for the purpose of really low hash can i get away with just using half of the 128 bits of a sha1 rather than dealing with the sha1 i understand this is not suitable for cryptographic but i just need the hashes for hash table computation time a and besides which hashing very small pieces of in mostly going to be taking 2 or 3 hashes and hashing them to get another is there a better option than sha1 for this collisions should be very a sql is it a good idea to use hashes as in will cause performance problems in sqlite or going to need to coordinate data across multiple databases a lucene so i figured i should deal with hashes directly in the tables rather than bothering with ids would only be meaningful in one not across all data i figure is a good big enough for unlikely collisions but saves on space lookup what about does that produce a random enough to use only of sha1 hash as an

for why and are over my feeling is that most people think of the latter as a way to iterate over a using the condition to define the rather than continuing to iterate over a block while some condition still the keyword semantics lend themselves to this interpretation and i suspect partly because of people find that the expressions are most readable in that for i would never use or to iterate over a though i and i used to use most often due to the but now i generally write i suppose that come to value readability over compactness and seems easier to parse quickly and thus more readable to my mind even though i do end up repeating a small amount of i rarely write while statements typically using foreach or linq in the cases where while statements would previously been come to think of not sure i use many for except in unit tests where generating some fixed number of a test

generally just include the namespace and expect that if whomever is processing it cares to validate then they will get the schema and set up their processing environment so that it can find the had limited success with and such most of the problems are usually centered around finding the xsd file some processors want the path to be included which is loads of fun if the xsd is on a file system instead of a web processor seems to implement the lookup a little some use separate schema catalog others require you to load and attach schemas unless you are providing the code to process you are best off to not include or the only thing that their inclusion can do is hamstring whomever is processing your document into either placing the schema in the same location or find some way to make their chosen processor ignore or workaround the location a side the biggest problem that run into was actually with dtds that were specified using a declaration that referred to the problem was that i was processing the documents on a freebsd i ended up writing my own resolver to map paths to a local file system since i could not modify the documents themselves and was required to validate

have much experience managing but i work on an application that works like is an interface for the users to select a report they want to view from a list of this list is populated by a reports table in the database which holds info like the report the file and which parameters the report are several common parameters in these reports they are or sorting so the user might pull up a report about all the widgets numbered 200 through grouped by now a person develops a stored and the report file at the same they pass it off to and i have to deploy it by running the sproc script in and moving the file to the right i then have to insert a record into the reports table with the and is a logistical challenge because no great way to keep track of which reports have been deployed onto which systems because they are mean they are there are 4 systems total that ideally should and there are several points of failure the params in the sproc match the params in the the params in the reports table match the params in the or the sproc is updated while the file for whatever what happens when a new report needs a parameter that been coded for in the params all boils down to the system not being dynamic like i i know about but i have a feeling that the guy doing the reports it seems like there must be a better way to keep the sproc and file in and to dynamically ask for the parameters it needs through something like is this normally reports best

have used the database testing that is built into visual studio 2008 database edition on a project it works but feels more like a third party to visual studio than a native some of the pains i felt with it sql code lives in the res files and a single code file can include multiple it is not as easy to search for tests based on multiple tests live in the same code you have some annoying variable name collisions if you have two tests in a single code all of the assertions for those tests have to have unique that means your assertion names will probably look like which really be your tests is not easy for if you want to move a test from one code file to the easiest way is to create the test from scratch in the new file because there are bits and pieces of the test scattered about the res file and the code of that as i started with it does work we have not added these tests to our continuous integration server so i comment on how easy it is to automate the running of these we are using tfs for and i am assuming that automation of the tests would work very similar to automation of standard unit in other it seems like there should be an mstest command line that would run the this is only an option if you are licensed to run visual studio 2008 db edition i understand is now included in the vs 2008 pro

i call does it call should take any required actions to dispose of the which should be if not identical calling is an implementation detail and not necessarily guaranteed we can expect that the bcl follows this i want to use an object but then use it again in another code should i not call which also means to omit the using you want to use the object you definitely should not dispose you should typically use two separate connections if going to the database two separate generally not a good idea to keep an around an longer than is needed to grab your needed to if a filestream is wrapping a streamwriter and i call dispose on the this will call and on whether calls on the if i call close on the this will only call and on the an object that wraps another disposable object should call on the interior calling on a will call its method under the so it will also act on both checking il a good way to answer these questions about what is happening under the il will definitely answer most of these questions as you can also just try debugging your own dispose there is of msdn documentation to start with before you try to figure it out and reflector if you want to muck around in

i consider the level of advancement pretty much the opposite of your therefore this response might not be directly but i hope at least somewhat any environment that encourages is if i see a lot of a lot of template and especially any use of a big red warning it means the developers have some idea of what correct programming but are constrained by either lack of imagination or politics to using a decrepit junk language such as c is boring and tedious to work but goes out of its way to interfere with check whether a particular technology or concept is treated as a if the prospective employer uses an easy check you can do do they use a real sax or dom is or do they parse it with regexes and serialize it with raw character if the it shows they understand xml is and just using it to have another acronym on the project figure out what language the developers they were using and every good developer has a favorite obscure language it matter whether or factor and a reason for preferring if everybody is content to work in another warning sign that not got much curiosity about programming in

i get data in postgresql is and i know i can use to make my queries i know there might even be a type in a future version of my question how do you deal with this when designing user thinking specifically of uniqueness say my data looks more or less like a file system google except that google docs actually allows duplicate names how can i make it easy for our users to understand the fact that they can have duplicate if the case is i think to most it will just seem get some questions out of the come from a windows so is how i i now primarily use mac os which you is the majority of our users fit into these same two new to most of my experience is with but also used which is like i thought a lot of about this issue but ultimately left everything and let our users just figure it interested in both technical solutions making this problem just go and ui design solutions helping the user feel comfortable with the do you deal with case insensitivity when designing user can i make it easy for our users to understand the fact that they can have duplicate if the case is i appreciate all the feedback so if the answer is allow duplicate names if they differ by then do i implement in one solution considered is silently maintaining a separate column which is always the version of the and putting the unique constraint on this do you expose case sensitivity to

i keep hearing that preparedstatements are good for have a java application in which we use the regular more than we use the while trying to move towards using more i am trying to get a more thorough understanding of how preparedstatements work on the client side and the server if we have some typical crud operations and update an object repeatedly in the does it help to use a i understand that we will have to close the ps every time otherwise it will result in a cursor how does it help with does the driver cache the precompiled statement and give me a copy the next time i do or does the db server understand the argument about the security benefits of preparedstatements and i appreciate the answers below which emphasize however i really want to keep this discussion focused on the performance benefits of when i say update i really mean more in terms of that method randomly being called several i understand the advantage in the answer offered below which asks to the statement inside a some code blah some more code blah blah void update throws preparedstatement ps is no way to actually reuse the java object and i understand that the actual call is quite is what brings me back to the original is this preparedstatement still being cached and reused under the covers that i dont know should also mention that we support several in and

i take into web to mean that just learning web programming in if if you have the time you might consider setting java aside temporarily and giving a closer look as eddie personally use perl instead of php is sexier resume fodder and lets you do some very cool things on the front but in my when it comes to writing code perl simply blows doors and heard that the extension puts perl on pretty even footing with but i used it made a living writing writing web apps in java and web apps in fond of both but as a learning put perl well ahead of as finding a bulky part of that as others have a function of java being a mature language with a variety of extensions that are unlikely to apply to your immediate but even stripped still need to deal with quite a bit of overhead before you can even get your first web app to get rolling much quicker with java tends to be pretty verbose in general compared with other not necessarily a bad my one big complaint with perl is you often encounter code that leverages various shortcuts and side effects to do an unholy ton of work in just a few this code is often and utterly bloody unintelligible to a terseness is not a virtue for the poor idiot who has to modify code six months after it was written especially when you wind up being the poor idiot in as a way of learning web sophistication can actually work against as a glad tools automagically take care of a lot of grunt work for like session but i completely what it was doing until i was thrown into a environment and had to deal with all that stuff guess it depends on why doing this and how much time you can devote to if time is limited and looking for something that will appeal to prospective then an excellent and gotten some solid advice in this thread about how to get started using if you do have the i highly recommend giving programming a it a particularly marketable skillset but learn things worth

i think this is it works for dram and the pagefile since that is an os managed cache is managed by the cpu os could do a tight timing loop of a memory read and try to see if it completes fast enough to be in the cache or if it had to go out to main memory this would be very error there are coherency that are used between processors to determine when to they need to invalidate each i suppose you could have a custom device that would snoop this protocol that the os would are you trying to if you want to force something into current x86 processors support prefetching memory into the cache in a for instance with visual you could use to fetch a line into the done this so use at your own to determine cache misses for you may be able to use some appendix a gives tuning this be used to determine if an individual address is in the cache or when it is loaded in the but can be used for overall i believe this is what vtune phenomenal profiler for this

instinct is entire pattern of creating things this way these are used just once or they are going to become pretty if you were creating a shape with 5 circles and 3 it would be a beyond a trivial example would probably be best done with some kind of those having it take a hash or xml to define your shapes might be extremely it all depends on how you expect them to be have the same kind of issues with creating swing controls in you end up with line after line of followed by a bunch of property calls as well as a line of code to copy the value to an object add a and a line to reset the kind of boilerplate should never happen in so i usually try to find a way to drive it with binding the controls to objects towards that a descriptive language would be very	
instructions you are following are simply to the limits that may prevent you from getting a core generation of a core dump is a trivial you send a signal to the process as are many things however that may prevent this from however you should try this first and see if it produces a core dump in your current if the program is interactive and trap the quit signnal then you may be able to cause core to dump by sending sigquit to the this is usually bound to area you are having problems with in the referenced document refers to process that run if your process is not running in either of those modes then you can safely ignore that can tell if the process is running by looking at the file permissions of the program and examining the setuid and setguid bits this can be done by issuing an ls command and looking for s in the 4th position or 7th position of setuid 1 root wheel 57616 28 oct you tried to generate a core without using the step that is not working and did it will need to be able to write in the directory that the process is running or the directory defined for core dumps if that is not the current running as root may solve the permissions

is an acronym for resource acquisition is technique is very much unique to because of their support for both constructors destructors almost automatically the constructors that are matching that arguments being passed in or the worst case the default constructor is called destructors if explicity provided is called otherwise the default one that is added by the compiler is called if you write an destructor explicitly for a this happens only for objects that are meaning that are not using the free store using technique makes use of this object feature to handle the objects that are created on the by explcitly asking for more memory using which should be explicitly destroyed by calling the class will wrap this another object that is created on the hence when constructor is the wrapped object is created on the memory when the handle goes out of destructor of that object is called automatically in which the wrapped object is destroyed using with oop if you wrap such objects inside another class in private you have access to the wrapped classes members methods this is the reason why smart pointers handle are designed these smart pointers expose the wrapped object as typed object to external world there by allowing to invoke any that the exposed memory object is made up note that smart pointers have various flavors based on different you should refer to modern programming by andrei alexandrescu or boost to learn more about hope this helps you to understand

is due to the different way that the clr handles structs and structs are value types which means they live on the stack rather than in the managed it is a good rule of thumb to keep structs small because once you start passing them as method arguments you will incur overhead as structs are copied in their entirety when passed to a classes pass a copy of their reference to methods they incur much less overhead when used as method best way to determine the size of your class is to total the number of bytes required by all the members of your class plus an extra 8 bytes for clr overhead stuff sync block index and the reference to the type of the

is happening is compiler is creating an internal class that it emits at compile this class is called the guid component of this class is generated at compile time so it changes with every internally in this class there is a dictionary that contains the different case and an int corresponding to each it then replaces the switch statement with a lookup in the dictionary to get the corresponding and does a switch on the int value more efficient than doing a bunch of sting	
is how it works in my an picture the entire table as a series of suppose you have an implementation with and have one bucket for each letter of the this implementation puts each item whose hash code begins with a particular letter in the corresponding say you have 200 but only 15 of them have hash codes that begin with the letter the hash table would only need to look up and search through the 15 objects in the rather than all 200 far as calculating the hash there is nothing magical about the goal is just to have different objects return different codes and for equal objects to return equal you could write a class that always returns the same integer as a for all but you would essentially destroy the usefulness of a as it would just become one giant

is no memory leak but you should use instead of especially since your function is you ever want to to use a type which has a your malloc based function is broken since it call any replace with simply doing double new stuff with is functionally equivalent it can call constructors for other it is simpler and requires less plus every programmer will instantly know what is going on since it involve an extra use smart pointers to completely avoid memory stuff with many smart programmers like to say best code is the code you have to why do you believe that the code you posted leaks i saw your comment to another post saying code execution command top allocated memory may be completely normal may not depending on your allocation usually the way heaps work is that they often but often shrink is to favor subsequent completely symmetric allocations and frees should allow the application to stabilize at a certain amount of result in continuous growth because the heap is highly likely to give the same block for each my question to you does it grow or does it simply not have asked what to do about a 2d i would use a class to wrap the either use a library believe boost has a array or rolling your own be too something like this may be goes like is technically more efficient to use something like for indexing a matrix wrapper but in this case i chose to simulate native array if efficiency is it can be made as efficient as native another what platform are you developing if it is then i would recommend valgrind to help pinpoint your memory since the code provided is clearly not the know of but i am sure that windows also has memory profiling for a matrix if you insist on using plain old why not just allocate it as a single contiguous block and do simple math on indexing like p new to access an just do width way you do a on the pointer whether it is a 1d or 2d

is not recommended to dynamically prepare the url at run especially based on this is primarily because you have no idea of the url that users would be using to access the application the application server could be behind a web a firewall or a load to keep it one cannot predict network current technique of fetching the url from the property file is good enough to resolve the said maybe you should look at providing an administrative console to manage the url appearing in especially if there is an admin console in or if there are related options that should go into my last point echoes what tony has spoken

is really only a follow up to john great it can be safe to make stateless methods are pretty much it can sometimes lead to coupling that is hard to consider you have a static method as class staticclassversionone public static void you call is all well and and very until you come across a case where you have to modify the behaviour of the static and find that you are tightly bound to possibly you could modify the code and it would be but if there was other callers dependent on the old need to be accounted for in the body of the in some cases that method body can get pretty ugly or unmaintainable if it tries to balance all these if you split out the methods you may have to modify code in several places to take account of or make calls to new consider if you had created an interface to provide the and given it to now when the behaviour has to a new class can be created to implement the which is more easily and more and that instead is given to the in this scenario the calling classes need to be altered or even and the changes are may or it may not be a likely but i think it is worth

just started learning how to use the entity framework to write a very simple network monitoring program this is a learning exercise to try and what only read about to also new to and linq to complicate things believe i have the data model suitably normalised but i may be visual studio generates a conceptual model that looks pluralised the associations and entitysets where but struggling to perform what i think is a fairly basic on the database contains 3 a server defined by the user that should be primary ip or a result containing data about the last server primary foreign key on an integer used to lookup one of 3 possible server time stamp of last a lookup table containing an integer string a unique string like or or have manually populated the database using a few simple entries just enough to give me something to work i would like to present all of the result data in a listview on a the listview contains the following static server address last the data needs to be generated by across each of the 3 column should display the linked from column should display linked from column should display i have no need for the object materialisation features of am i correct in thinking it would be more to use entity and if what would a suitable entity sql query look what i tried using linq to entities and anonymous types in a method but was thwarted by a lack of understanding on a suitable return results from r in state s in where select no can for your beginners entity framework query to populate a winforms

know i am not the only one who does not like progress bars or time estimates which give unrealistic estimates in best examples are installers which jump from to in 10 seconds and then take an hour to complete the final of the time programmers just estimate the steps to complete a task and then display as a ignoring the fact that each step might take a different time to for if you insert rows into a the insertion time can increase with the number of inserted rows or the time to copy files does not only depend on the size of the file but also on the location on the disk and how fragmented it i asked myself if anybody already tried to model this and maybe created a with a configurable robust i know that it is difficult to give robust estimates because external factors user runs other play their there is also a solution that uses profiling to set up a better or one could use machine learning anybody know of advanced solutions for this connection to i found the article the progress very it shows how progress bars can change the perception of time and how you can use those insights to create progress bars that seem to be can think of ways how to manually tune the time and even with a i will have to fine tune the but i think this problem could be tackled with statistical of the estimator would collect data during the process to create better estimates for the next i do now is to take the average time something took in the previous step grouped by type and normalized by file size of and take this average as estimate for the next steps counting in different types and i know are better statistical to create estimators and i wonder if anybody applied those to the time estimates for progress bars

knowing what your model looks i can only assume that what doing is pushing blobs of binary data to the server and you want to push the entire blob back at asking why in this scenario you would want to do a basic pattern where you take the data trying to split it into you send a chunk with a sequence number to the server and continue sending chunks asynchronously in whatever order you feel when the server has received all of the chunks this possibly by you already having sent a to the it can commit all those chunks to a database or disk or you are dealing with rows of data rather than chunks of binary data the pattern is still fairly regardless of your ajax implementation the goal would be to determine how many rows you plan on sending set up some kind of progress bar that updates and then continually invoke a method that submits one row of changed each time you do that you can then inch the progress bar forward and allow the user to remain fully aware of the progress of the pattern should work regardless of how storing your underlying

mention your if not sql the specifics of how to get the data might be but the advice is fundamentally the at for but the first thing to do is to follow advice and scan for execution plans using management studio if you are running sql guessing see is that for small date the optimizer picks a reasonable query but that when the date range is it picks something completely likely involving either table scans or index and possibly joins that lead to very large temporary the execution plan analyzer will reveal all of scan means that the optimizer thinks that grinding over the whole table or the whole index is cheaper for what you are trying to do than seeking specific you eventually want to do is get indexes and the syntax of your query set up such that you keep index seeks in the query plan for your query regardless of the date failing that the scans you require are filtered as well as you can manage to minimize temporary recordset size and thereby avoid excessive reads and

not asking for anyone to do this homework for but i bring it up because a very good practical introduction to and but at the same time i feel perhaps a little too this really the best way to teach what key threading concepts are in this what would new programmers using threads for the first time likely fail to have alot of theoretical knowledge about threading but had to do alot of it myself in the does anyone have any caveats for me when writing the link to the original here is the goals create a circular queue class and create a to use it next in thread safe means that operation that changes contents of the queue should executed by only one thread at a in order to avoid data circular queue is implemented as fixed size array where the and end of the queue are indices the as the queue fills beginning and end of the queue shift to higher values as elements added and eventually wrap around the first index in the array to the this class should throw an exception to the caller if the operation create a gui to two threads in a the gui will be able to and start and stop both the and consumer threads and control rate at which they modify would you this homework

not clear exactly what has in but suggest a few some of which may not be feasible due to other written this out pretty much as thought about it i think it helps to see the train of thought in as make it easier for you to do the same thing next you like my of course is inherently functional in that means that queries have for expect a method with a signature return a new sequence of user objects with extra rather than mutating the existing the only information currently appending is the so add a method in along the lines user whatever you need to create a clone of this user clone new return might even want to make fully immutable there are various strategies around such as the builder ask me if you want more the main thing is that created a new user which is a copy of the old but with the specified inner back to your currently got three methods but my is that only the first one needs to be and that the rest of the api actually need to expose the facebook it looks like your method is basically although probably line up the query in terms of given a sequence of local users and a collection of facebook left doing the actual mapping a straight clause is because it yield the local users which have a matching facebook we need some way of treating a user as if they were a facebook user without an essentially this is the null object can do that by coming up with a facebook user who has a null uid the object model allows adjust for however the user should actually be static readonly facebookuser nullfacebookuser new we actually want a of these because what static readonly nullfacebookusers we can simply this dummy entry to our real and do a normal inner note that this that the lookup of facebook users will always find a user for any facebook if not the need to revisit this and not use an inner include the user at the then do the join and project using var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals select the full class would sealed class facebookmapper private static readonly nullfacebookusers public var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals select private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using few points noted the inner join becomes problematic if a facebook uid might not be fetched as a valid we get problems if we have duplicate facebook users each local user would end up coming out replaces the avatar for second group see if we can address these assume that if fetched facebook users for a single facebook then it matter which of them we grab the avatar from they should be the we need is a group so that for each local user we get a sequence of matching facebook then use to make life can keep as it was before but this time only going to call it if got a facebook user to grab the avatar a group join in query expressions is represented by this query is reasonably but not too var facebookusers return from user in join facebookuser in facebookusers equals into let firstmatch select firstmatch null user the query expression but with sequence is just our local user in perform a group join the range variable now be a sequence of facebookusers with the right this could be facebookuser in facebookusers equals into convert an empty sequence into a single null and then take the element the first matching facebookuser or firstmatch if not got a return the original otherwise return a new copy with the appropriate firstmatch null user option is to only use linq very for var facebookusers var uiddictionary foreach user in facebookuser if out yield return yield return uses an iterator block instead of a linq query will throw an exception if it receives the same key twice one option to work around this is to change to make sure it only looks for distinct private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using assumes the web service works of course but if it you probably want to throw an exception anyway your pick out of the the group join is probably hardest to but behaves the iterator block solution is possibly the and should behave okay with the immutable would almost certainly be a positive step nice of all of these solutions is that the users come out in the same order they went that may well not be important to but it can be a nice this helps been an interesting question is mutation the way to seen in your comments that the local user type is actually an entity type from the entity it not be appropriate to take this course of making it immutable is pretty much out of the and i suspect that most uses of the type will the it may be worth changing your interface to make that instead of returning an implies to some extent you might want to change both the signature and the leaving you with something like sealed class facebookmerger public void var facebookusers var uiddictionary foreach user in facebookuser if out private var uids u in where select return facebook users for uids using this a particularly solution the main any more but as not really

not sure how this works on other platforms but on the mac there is the following clear distinction in which has little to do with file format causes all subsequent to overwrite the file you just created using so modifies the location of the document that you are working with and stores its current state in that new while leaving the original copy does not have this you export to a specific path only after that a operation will still save to the location of the document as it was before the was even in an application that supports a plethore of file such as which allows you to to various formats of varying an command may still make in fact it makes way more sense than saving a complicated document to seemingly retaining any in the while affecting any subsequent saves to also save to that same the fundamental difference is not in file format or a format but the conceptual difference i described leads to a logical distinction in what qualifies a file format to appear in your and when you might want to relegate it to an

personally prefer things to be and to make my life easier i consider making my life easier may not be what you consider making your life so do with this advice what you you have something like new new you have an inconsistency parameters are the other is created on the to be consistent you would pass things as pass things created on the one of those will work first are also practical aspects to it as making a variable makes debugging are some are still lines in the you want to display the next line for debugging you now need to change it are still lines in the line would be easier to have made the variable up it is safer because you are less likely to accidentally call twice forgetting to take it out of the foo can also view the value of in a debugger without having to go into the one that can happen is in java you get a nullpointerexception on this or the thing that was no nullpointexception here you know b was nullpointexception here you know c was null can view d in the debugger without having to go into debuggers will let you highlight and see what it but that is dangerous if has side effects as the debugger will wind up calling each time you get the value via the way i code for this does make it more verbose this answer but it also makes my life easier if things are not working as expected i spend far less time wondering what went wrong and i am also able to fix bugs much faster than before i adopted this way of doing me the most important thing when programming is to be if you are consistent then the code is much easier to get through because you are not constantly having to figure out what is going and your eyes get drawn to any in the

position elements are typically a bit of a warning sign for by taking things out of the document flow you are losing one of the main benefits of which is by mixing px and em measurements you are creating a slightly stylesheet jam that allow for the page to be resized the central problem seems to be a question of whether you are barking up the right tree in terms of approach and do you to be using the maintainpositiononscrollback option from it be too hard to implement a bit of light javascript to create an equivalent effect on an overflowed if you are stuck with the do you to have your text in a small box like that or could you just let the page be as long as the you to use the maintainpositionscrollback and you to have the content in a small box you might be better off using some less code for your perhaps putting the content in an iframe would give you the behaviour you are looking if losing most of the benefits of semantic html and css in order to implement the design you want then not going to sacrifice much more by taking a different approach to the	
possibility is to use you describe with a script how you project is to be and cmake generates the visual studio files for if you need to build your project from the command or in a continuous integration you use cmake to generate a makefile for if you project is a one you can run cmake to generate the makefiles for the toolchain of your simple cmake script looks like these two lines with a makefile or the way you setup a simple project in your favorite a nutshell cmake does not only your project it also makes it if you like to just test your project with eclipse or or just run cmake to generate the corresponding project in practice it is no always so but the cmake idea just if you consider using cmake with visual studio there is some tweaking required to obtain the familiar vs project main obstacle is to organize your header and source but it is possible check the cmake wiki by writting a short script you might even simplify this

prefer the first method because you can cast the derived class pointer to the parent class without any the other way c standard guarantees that the address of a struct is the address of the first so in the second case it is safe to cast a pointer to derived to as the first member of derived is the parent and a the struct as a member as the same layout as the same struct when not a so casting a pointer to a derived to parent will always same is not true for the second two structs with some members defined as the same type may have different padding between those would be reasonable for a 64 bit bigendian compiler to a a b that is a whole multiple of 8 and b is 64 bit but b a b c that is a whole multiple of but b is only 32 bit aligned so that it waste

problem in general terms is the security model of java that actually attempts to prevent that a class that has already been loaded be loaded course java since the beginning has supported dynamic class what it is difficult is class was consider harmful and for a good reason that a running java application got injected with an new class with malicious for instance a cracked implementation comming from the internet that instead of creating deletes some random file hile invoking the method they way java was conceived and i presume clr in because it was highly in was to prevent an already loaded class to load again that same offered a mechanism to override this but again the rules for the class loaders they should ask permission to the classloader before attempting to load a new if the parent has already loaded the the new class is instance i have used classloaders that load a classes from ldap or rdbms hot deploy becomes a necessity in the java world when the application server became mainstream for java ee and also create the need for micro containers like spring to avoid these kind of burden the whole app server after every compile drives anyone app server offer this class loaders to help hot and using a configuration that should be disabled when set in but the tradeoff is you have to use tons of memory in so the good way to do this is restart every 3 4 happen with other languages that were designed from the beginning to load their ruby for you can even add methods to a running override a method at runtime or even add a single method to an unique specific tradeoff in these kinds of environments is of course memory and hope this found this product some time ago that promises that reload is make as simple as i remember the link when i first wrote this and i is from

quality begins with the language in languages are tools and have strengths and so any definition for code quality must consider in quality code exploits the strength of the language while exhibiting minimal dependence on its established we then can see that the skill of the coder is really what we are looking for in this means that money has no place in this some of the best code ever seen never made a it also means that the number of bugs in the code is not a good factor consider that code may work exactly as the requirements dictate thus making the bug an aspect of the requirements and not the code that flawlessly implements perfectly correct requirements can still be of low so correctness or lack of bugs can only be part of the leaves two other things to consider in making our ease of maintenance and performance when of maintenance is harder to but it has to do with the difficulty in reading and understanding the code of course brings in another the skill of the that might best be measured in it also has to do with the difficulty in changing the after code that is engineered well anticipates extensions to some so forethought in design that enables changes without whole scale restructuring makes for higher we all have faced the prospect of altering code significantly only to find that we are better off with a complete in execution is more than just it means writing code that is not as in setting values that remain unchanged within loops rather than outside the the comment above about efficient use of resources is very good as

reading some of your responses i was thinking that general problem with the described metric is that it negative reporting bugs it encourage producing good quality is and have the same trouble with any other metric you the key issue is that quality is not something we know how to measure you really care about the question of code quality primarily if doing your job your real question should is this person helping us make is not something you can do with but it is something you have to try to the best advice i can give you is that your managers simply have to work with the programmers and understand what the programmers are another important source of information comes from a peers who work with them day in and day since we have a numerical way to measure you will to some degree or another have to rely on the softer science to get insight into how well your programmers are	
reading some some pdf is loaded by the acrobat reader it kind of does own thing and has nothing to do with any of the html or even the browser for that matter from being loaded by the have the same problem with the flash and no solution for so i would imagine no solution for this best bet is to redesign your menus so they move into the space occupied by the it is a then you cannot reliably place other elements over the top of browsers usually let go of most of their ability to elements when plugins are there is no direct support for overlaying a div either in the api or the loads an executable file in very simple punches a hole in the browser using the technique is the standard workaround although transparency can be each one inside a div with different when you click the yellow the empty iframe is displayed front of the pdf so you can see the green div inside the pdf function var elem if

reason is that databases are about and objects are about structures and once you take the data and embed it in you characterize the relationships and operations in a static on the other are about unstructuring the data into a bunch of instances of atomic tables that can be reassembled into different structures with without disturbing the integrity of the are somewhat analogous to

recently did some work modifying a python gui app that was using wxpython experimented with python in fits and starts over last six or seven but this was the first time i did any work with a i was pretty disappointed at what seems to be the current state of gui programming with i like the python language itself a a fun change from the programming used definitely a big productivity increase for general purpose programming like to move to python for wxpython is a huge step backwards from something like vcl or while python itself offers nice productivity gains from generally programming a higher level of wxpython is used at a way lower level of abstraction than the for i wasted a lot fo time trying to get a wxpython list object to behave the way i wanted it just to add sortable columns involved several one to create and maintain a that provided the actual sort another to make it possible to show in the column and there were a couple more i all of these error prone steps could be accomplished simply by setting a property value using my delphi grid while python provides big productivity gains by raising level of abstraction for a lot of general purpose wxpython is several levels of abstraction than the gui tools available for net gui programming with delphi is way faster than gui programming with and the resulting ui with delphi is still more polished and it seem to me like exaggerating to say that delphi gui programming was more advanced back in 1995 than python gui programming with wxpython is in did some investigating of other python gui frameworks and it look like any were substantially better than i also did some minimal investigation of gui formbuilders for which would have made things a little bit but by most reports those solutions are buggy and even a great formbuilder address my main complaints about which are simply that it has fewer features and generally requires you to do gui programming at a much lower level of abstraction than used to with some quick investigating into suggested python solutions is honestly somewhat depressing for someone used to delphi or got a couple of am i missing is there some solution for python that can compare with vcl or winforms i necessarily care if it quite measure up to just looking for something in the same could ironpython be the direction to mostly tried to avoid drinking the but maybe ironpython gives me a reason to finally give even does ironpython fully integrate with or would i need to have the forms themselves be backed by or it looks to me like that definitely is the case with sharpdevelop and monodevelop ironpython be used to do gui does fully integrate ironpython with really seems to me like python could over the in a way similar to the way that visual basic did back in the early if some wonderful new solution came out for only this time with python have a whole new paradigm of cross and gui corporations eat that i web apps are the main focus of things these so a great solution create same revolution that vb once but i see gui programming disappearing and like a nice open high level current state of gui programming with

reputation system is without real life if anonymous people can be invited then it can always be with sufficient effort and false aim should be to increase the cost of such gaming above the potential which will depend on what your system gets used main cost you can use to inhibit power gains is forcing users to contribute positively reviewed contributions before you increase their you do and how you make it difficult for them to leverage existing identities to falsely rate as positive the contributions of new identities they are trying to give power is the nuts and bolts of the and should make use of an existing user base to spot and penalise spurious false can make use of game theory by rewarding people for being in the so if a accuses b of it is highlighted and lots of people get to vote on those who cast their mojo on the side of the vote that ends up get it back and increase in reputation for reliability is worth having more than one type of while those in the lose a triangle number of mojo the first 2 the 3 the 6 the 10 the and so

sieve of eratosthenes works fine as illustrative way to find but i would implement it a little bit the essence is that you have to check numbers which are multiples of already known instead of using an array to store this you can also create a list of all sequential primes up to the square root of the number you are and then it suffices to go through the list of primes to check for you think of this does what you do on the but in a more quickly hacked implementation of what i mean copied from the web public class sieve private readonly primes new private int public one could add more to speed things up a but one is public bool first check if we can compare against known if return if make sure that we got all primes up to the square of int maxfactor while bool isprime for primeindex primeindex int prime if prime isprime if now apply the sieve to the number to foreach prime in if prime return if return about 67ms on my slow test program static void stopwatch sw new sieve sieve new for i i

since these higher level manage the memory for what you use data structures main reason for using a data structure is not about garbage but it is about storing data in a way that is efficient in some so what matters most is how you are organizing the which is exactly what the language automatically figure out for the high level language will come with several preloaded data structures should use these preloaded data structures when they are provided instead of making your but not all data structures are provided that you may structures organize the storage of memory in some way so that the algorithms that run on them can be implemented giving efficient most tasks you need to implement your own data but this depends fully on what you are can understand the need for and stacks but would you ever need use a binary tree in are a lot of examples for using a binary but not in common every day for example you may need to implement huffman data can be used to have the space savings and fast lookups of using a or you may need to store a lot of data with fast lookup by using a several data structures have specific uses and are optimized for different whether the language is modern or not and whether it has garbage collection or not change trend is that custom implemented data structures are coded and thought about a similar argument happens with common in more modern like linq you simply specify to you actually say how to

suspect the difference is a conversion from an floating point value to a long vs a conversion from an floating point value to a one and a conversion to a reason for 80 bits coming up at all is that a typical precision used for actual and the width of floating point the result is something like the conversion from that to a long yields the nearest floating point value to the value is actually so the conversion ends up yielding to give this a bit more a java program which uses arithmetic to do the same note that it converts the double value closest to into a bigdecimal that value is other the exact result of the calculation is 11 class public static void bigdecimal c new bigdecimal a new bigdecimal b new bigdecimal result the other correct to about 40 decimal digits more than either 64 or 80 bit floating point can consider what this number looks like in i have any tools to easily do the but again we can use java to assuming a normalised the part ends up using three bits less than for eleven that leaves 60 bits of mantissa for extended precision and 48 bits for double precision the closest number to 11 in each use class public static void bigdecimal half new bigdecimal eleven new the three numbers got work out the closest value to the correct one for each precision for extended less than round each of those values to a and you end up with 10 and 11 this is enough evidence to convince the doubters

talk to a very wide variety of the potential clients and find out their what they are currently using and what they wish their current could spend 10 times as long at this as you think you need to right draw out a potential guis on paper and have the people you interview look at the drawings and make if at all hire some people in the industry as business analysts to help with this ask about legal some industries have a lot of legal complicance issues and others do anything related in any way to the medical world and you will need to research and fully understand hippa for the database structure and a gui then get some real users to play with refactor based on what they say amazing how many things users leave out in requirements gathering that they think of until faced with an actual about what needs to common through all the potential customers and where you might need customization your interviews should guide you decide how to handle or even if you will allow this may depend a great deal on the industry and how standard their practices this is box often the design includes a table with customizable fields that can be added to forms and reports by the a often each user wanting customization may have their own database where the custom information is stored a central standrad database for the noncustomizable and the programmers make the changes based on requests from the if you take this the second time you do a simliar customization for a second consider if you need to refactor to make this a new feature of the software available to no need to write 17 custom attendance reports that vary only by one or two fields when the client can for less money have a standard the web you can also create a bunch of modules and have the clients pick and choose which to add to their custom they would pay based on the number and complexity of the modules they so the client that wants only three of the standard reports would pay less than the client that wants all when a new customization is the client pays for development if the suggestion seem to immdeiately apply to but the module is done so that others can buy it as if others buy the orginal client who asked for the change might get part of the money until their development costs is they could also require that something remain as a custom module and pay a much higher price for this we have some clients who even want their data on the same servers in the same location as other needless to we charge a huge premium for doing something like is expensive and can lead to many more programmers consider very strongly before you go the customization it can really be the thing which sells your software but it scale it bad when you have ten cutomers but when you have a couple of hundred it can get out of control very it is a lot harder to back off of customization once you offer than to add customization later from a standard often the need for customization is more in the organization of corporate if you can create a reporting interface where people can pick and choose what information they want and save their own custom you might handle most of the customization needs in your industry without customization

that what you have is an array of two i doubt there is a need to raise that number up at some if at some point you decide to add 3d functions i would therefor prefer to stay with an but there is no need to use a dynamic use an array wrapped in a struct like double double double double array return you can add it to a vector which will contain is probably the best you can get if you aim for both simplicity and is a pretty small and simple it basically amounts to array t several of like and and other but without so that you can initialize it like a normal array as we did

that you do not intend to make this a pulic api that you are not shipping it to 3rd parties and expecting them to make use of you can do the that you require access to treemap specific but also might decide later to change the inheritance to be something other than as long as you do not write any code that depends on the class being a treemap never refer to treemap aside from the then you are safe using this would require that you write an interface that provided the treemap you find that you do not want to sue treemap and want to use something else later since you are not refering to treemap anywhere that will be you are then left with all of the calls to treemap specific if all of those go away at the same time that you no longer extend from treemap then you are good to if they do not then you will need to write your own to implementation of the methods that you find out what you need or not if you changed from treemap you would comment out all of the methods you put into the interface you if the code compiles with the empty interface you are good to if not you need to add the missing methods back into the if the class you decided to extend provide the missing methods you have work to do you did have to extend from alternative solution is to figure out in advance if you are really going to need i am not sure that i would want to go too far into a project where i was unsure of what i was needing for my data

the memory location has a special meaning on your the compiler should know that and not put any variables that would be similar to the io mapped space on most it has no knowledge that using it to store it just knows that normal variables go many embedded compilers support language extensions that allow you to declare variables and functions at specific usually using generally the way seen people implement the sort of memory mapping trying to do is to declare an int at the desired memory then just treat it as a global you could declare a pointer to an int and initialize it to that both of these provide more type safety than a

the most part openmp and opencl are independent from each they are both ways of giving the developer access to parallelism on their is designed to work well with multiple where work that is approximately equal can be automatically farmed out between is a somewhat different in that it is really shines when working with special it will allow you to offload some of the number crunching to the gpu or some other like in the it was also built with the idea that it could be used to harness other main as are now common in i would consider this feature to be and if this is all you intend to use opencl i would not recommend using guess it would be somewhat though definitely not impossible to get openmp and opencl to work together in the same first thing to think about is what work giving to this would definately be a case where you would only want opencl to run on the on the other since openmp is alreay using it cause application errors to run opencl and openmp on the same main but it will cause scheduling where both the openmp and opencl run slower because they spend a good chunk of their time switching back and fourth between each this would also happen if you run any other process on the same core at the same other big thing to think about is how going to schedule tasks that do run on the its true that you can feed a lot of work into one of the modern but there are lots of things to think about with the pipeline and memory what you want to happen is to have 8 different openmp threads each trying to send their own work to the at the same i would recommend having only one thread that manages all the interactions with the so it can make sure to feed it work in an efficient sure there are programs that have multiple types of tasks happening at the same where one type of task could always be farmed out to the and another kind of task could be handled by the main this would be a fine example of a time to mix openmp and

there are arguments for favor of nonmember offers allows better code reuse can be reused for container because a free if it had been a ever container would have to define its makes a lot of generic programming tricks is not valid if is an that makes it a bit more awkward to write generic code working on but can be made valid for any even ones like it can also make mixins through composition a lot because it require the user to yourself through members to get to the mixin object you want to operate favor of making things member functions java and and in a lot of member functions are synonymous with that argument should not be code readability is and if people find it easier to read the member a strong argument in its it just produce better from a strict point of nonmembers should be preferred when	
there are limited strategies for automating memory allocation and deallocation in the compiler generates a lot of code behind the scenes for you it keeps track of each variable on the stack and makes sure that the appropriate destructor is called when the stack is cleaned this is actually a fairly sophisticated type of code especially when you throw exceptions into the on the other hand is much which is why sometimes called level assembly c have any mechanism to guarantee that a particular bit of code is called when a function exits or a variable is popped off the so up to you to keep track of each bit of memory you allocate and every file or network socket you open and clean them up at the appropriate no practical way to build an automatic smart pointer in concept you should look at is rather that try to keep track of every individual block of memory you you create a do some chunk of placing every memory block you allocate into the then free the whole pool when you trade off a little bit of performance and control here in order to ease the cognitive load on the but most of the time well worth should take a peek at the apache portable runtime they have a memory pool library at if apr is too much for you to dive you can implement a very simple memory pool using three functions and a linked list data pseudocode would be something pool struct pool pool allocate a pool and return it pool void create a new pool node and push it onto the list pool walk the free each memory block then free its node the pool is something like struct pool pool is empty pool full of clean it up and make a new one pool new pool is empty return

there is no portable way to restrict the number of characters input in but whatever platform you are using will provide some for example on look up you do go with plain old iostreams input from a good idea to read the initial text into a using this will prevent buffer because resize as code involving is technically safe in that it read more than 5 characters into but this code is fragile if you later decide you want 6 you could easily forget to update your call to leading to you need to remember to but as i use you read the input into a using or some once in there you need to get it out in the form of a this is where the class is useful it lets you treat an existing as a stream to read so you can use the formatted input cerr went seriously extract an integer value from the stream that wraps extraction failed a more serious problem like eof cerr a number else if 1000 i cerr of else process using you can actually just extract directly from instead of going via a and an extract an integer value from this can have subtle undesirable any additional characters on the line typed by the user particular the typed when they press will remain in the input buffer to be read by the next often this but sometimes it if you follow up with expecting that this will wait for a it it will just read the the first character the user

think deriving your class from your class demonstrates confusion of is your data editing object a special type of database or maybe it would make more sense to say the data editing object needs to use a database is the difference between is a and has it seems to be falling out of fashion you can use a singleton factory call to get the database then any function which needs it can simply call if you make the handler the first time it has to do any then nothing needs to even worry about initializing do check if the instance variable containing the handle is a resource handle if call the remember to decide what to do if the connection then you just need a way for the handler to find i would have the factory call do not the variant way of doing that is for the constructor to get the current database handler and put a reference to it in an instance this can be done several requiring it in the constructor might or you can fall back on the singleton factory call this technique gives the object constructor a chance to deny instantiation if the database handler initialize factory call can check

think markusq has the but let me develop an alternative that you may find easier to use my of developing this as a series of simple transformations in an analogue of in a procedural put everything in common recall that column is seconds since the midnight 1 january we can find the number of seconds since midnight of the day of the that call by just taking s modulus the number of seconds in a 60 60 as 60 dur 1 as subtract one from because a one second call that starts at also ends on can find minutes since midnight by dividing those results by or just by s 60 view s 60 as s dur 60 as we create a table of we need 1440 of numbered from 0 to in databases that support arbitrary i an artificial range or like create table id int not null primary key idz insert into values repeat next line to double insert into select idz from to create a create view minute as select id 1 as from where id we just join to our record view from minutes a just cross record so we have one record row for each whole minute over which the call was that doing this by defining active as the call occurred during a that a two second call that starts at and ends at by this definition occurs during two different but a two second call that starts at and ends at occurs during one did that because you specified i need a way to check for a count of active calls for if you prefer to consider only calls lasting more than sixty seconds to occur in more than one need to adjust the if we want to find the number of active records for any granularity equal to or larger than minute we just group on that last to find average calls per hour we divide by 60 to turn minutes to select 60 as 60 as from group by 60 that that is the average per hour for over all if we want to limit it to a particular day or range of add a we create a version of that does a left outer we can get a report that shows the average over all hours in the create view select from minutes a left outer join on and we again do our but against the new select 60 as 60 as from group by 60 hour 0 1 2 3 can also index into this with a the join means have null values for the underlying table where no calls exist for a particular select 60 as 60 as from where 1 and 2008 group by 60 bring back no rows for hours in which no calls if we still want our view that shows all we make sure we also include those hours with no select 60 as 60 as from where 1 and or date is null group by 60 that in the last two using a sql date which the functions and can be not the date in your record brings up another both the date and time in your record table are superfluous and as each can be derived from your column leaving them in the table allows the possibility of inconsistent in which or prefer to do it like create table record id int not null primary create view as select as from the the is an enumerated type that tells the function to add is the column in

think that best approach for you to take hen explaining this to your is by examples drawn from well known and succesful software and the way they approach major and minor first thing i would say is that the dot notation for releases is a relatively recent for most releases of unix actually had names sometimes included a meaningless rather than version assuming you want to use then the major number indicates a version that is basically incompatible with much that went consider the change from windows to most applications simply fit in with the new overlapped windows in windows for less a radical change in file formats could be a reason for a major version change wp graphic apps often work this other reason for a major version number change is that the user notices a once again this was true for the change from windows to and was responsible forv the latters if your app looks very a major for the minor version this is typically used to indicate a chanhe that actually is quite but that be noticeable to the for the differences internally between win and win were actually quite but the interface stayed the the third version well few people know hat it really means and fewer for in my everyday work i use the gnu compiler version how does this differ from i a

think the considerations related to the decisions that where made before has changed that the schema those will just help you organize the database so you can assign permissions to all inside a schema instead of having to configure for each decisions involved on whether having the identity flow down to the sql server instead of using the trusted subsytem are pretty much specific to the particular that i like to flow identity like because usually there is still logic being enforced on the application which means the sp are probably enforcing partial because of that that approach also pushes to have more logic in the stored only administrators having access to the user groups in the consider looking at adam directory application i know if it supports integrating it with sql so i am not sure if that will work with that it is worth checking not being able to get the based on your i would assume there is a close relation between user groups and involved database you can get the the user has in active evaluate how adam fits in your and whether the considerations involved into using the current identity flow approach also forget to consider the impact in the project on changing the identity flow of the	
think the important thing to remember here is that each table in your might have multiple these are the wikipedia entry for candidate all candidate keys are created they are each unique identifiers for the table in job then is to select the best candidate from the pool of candidate keys to serve as the the primary key will be used by other tables to establish the relational but you are free to continue using candidate keys to query the primary keys are referenced by other and therefore used in join the criteria for primary key selection boils down to the following for me order of primary key values should not if they you run the risk of introducing update most dbms platforms require that the primary key are not simple datatypes and values for physical storage and integer values work well and this is the datatype of choice for most identified the candidate the criteria above can be used to select the primary if there is not a candidate key meets the then a surrogate key that does meet the criteria can be created and used as mentioned in other

this is referred to as and a property on all container to do what you looking you can use a creation policy of is the creationpolicy of means that the container delays creating some or all descendants until they are a process which is known as deferred this policy produces the best startup time because fewer uicomponents are created this introduces navigation delays when a user navigates to other parts of the application for the first navigator containers such as and viewstack implement the policy by creating all their children but wait to create the deeper descendants of a child until it becomes the selected child of the navigator creationpolicy of means that the navigator containers immediately create deeper descendants for each rather than waiting until that child is for containers such as a vbox there is no difference between the and info careful with this flex picked auto as the default for a if your app grows the initialization time under will be

thought i would ask this question to see why many examples and people prefer to use inline databinding in the aspx code vs implementing an ondatabinding event when using any control i always implement the ondatabinding method for field level controls if i need to do anything that built in out of the box i need to do an most examples i see have the code right in the aspx page using the inline of inline of how i prefer to do the the codebehind void literal lit personally prefer the codebehind method because it keeps my aspx pages clean and i have all this inline code all over the place and the next guy just knows to always look in the files for code the seperation of presentation and code is also maintained better this way as the html is place holders only and the codebind is determining what is actually being put in these are very basic the field could be a integer that you want to format with leading 0s or a datetime that needs a specific format it could also take all sort of manipulation and code to get the finally value that should be stored in the property at the do you draw the line and move it to the codebehind if you are using inline are the pros and cons for doing it either one take more overhead than the i am not talking about assigning a value to a control that is just on the page but one that is being databound to because it exists in a repeater template or gridview item template obviously a literal sitting on a page you can just assign in i thought i would gather more especially with regards to the do most people not use the ondatabinding vs cons and

to people building tagging read it is not what you are looking i asked this when i aware that rdbms all have their own optimization just use a simple many to many have a posting system that has millions of each post can have an infinite number of tags associated with can create tags which have date a tag is almost like a post because people can post notes about the tag association has an owner and so we can see who added the tag and question is how can i implement it has to be fast searching posts by or tags by users can add tags to posts by typing the name into a kind of like the google search it has to fill in the rest of the tag name for have 3 solutions at the but not sure which is the or if there is a better that not showing the layout of notes since it will be trivial once i get a proper solution for linked in post points to a linked list in the application must traverse the list until is simply a varchar or text field containing a tab delimited array of it cannot be a fixed same thing 3 raises the how fast will it be to iterate through every single row in 1 and 2 should be fast for returning tags by but for posts by another lookup table must be last thing i have to worry about is optimizing searching tags by i have not worked that out made an ascii diagram database tagging

tough this should do var count else return count and the above it is not very i also want to take a second to suggest you change the format of your html a little you want to make your code be as semantically relevant to the content it holds as having one huge table mixing parents and childs is not the optimal way of achieving i am not sure what your use case is but consider doing something like could still style this however you want to give it the appearance you although it may not be as easy if you really are displaying tabular data about the parents and that you could then simplify the above with a much more var count count changing the code from a table to a list is not but you have access to the code that presumably generates this you could at least make things easier then by giving all the children a class with the id of the and giving all the parents a common would then allow you to do much faster than the original var id var count count

vpn provide any sort of encryption out of the it provides security through not when you contract for wan service using mlps the telecom company is providing some guarantees that your traffic will be somewhat isolated from the rest of the all of this talk about the vpn encryption apply to mlps there are two questions if your data were compromised by someone with access to the does that pose a is it easier to compromise a wan you can answer as others have pointed if any of this data is sensitive or can reveal information about other systems that can be used to compromise your then you need to protect does it reveal about the users of the softwaer network then the risk of leaving it unprotected might be for the answer is the major vulnerability is the physical security the traffic is physically outside of your control for a long you are relying on the physical security locked buried fiber other major vulnerability is how the telco has setup the routers and other equipment that handle your wan are those routers separated from other what other traffic is carried by those can those routers be remotely administered remotely via the telco another mlps or via the of those devices can be your unencrypted wan traffic is at this comes back to what are the potential consequences if your network traffic were

want to email and write to pdf very simple the reports are basically a list of divided in various the sections are not necessarily think just wasted a solid 2 days of work trying to make this kind of reports using i find that jasper is great for outputing the kind that would come out of a database for each row neatly describing an item and each item printed on a simplifying a bit but the given what i want to do i always ended up completely data not being displayed for no apparent columns of texts never the correct column positioning always ending up pagination not sanely possible was never able to figure it the faq gives an obscure came to the conclusion that jasper is really not built to make the kind of reports i am i missing ready to pay for a as long as the price is by reasonable i mean a few answer here is more information about the report i made in i want is something like i made in jasper is subreports are all the same actual this report has one field and basically just prints this field in a detail running a single subreport simply lists all items from the the datasource itself is a simple custom jrdatasource containing a collection of strings in the field the datasource iterates over the collection until there are no more each subreport has its own tried many different variations of the with all sorts of different properties for the this is fairly simple the problems i encounter are as starting from the 3rd show up when their position type is they do show up when they have relative to i want to do this because the first two subreports can be of any make each subreport to stretch according to its own they either stretch at all is not desirable because they have different or they stretch according to the longest this makes a weird layout for if some subreports fall outside the they simple one alternative is to increase the considerably and the band in this case it is not really possibly to know the total height in so stuck with it the report is even more long reports end up on one page and this is not acceptable printout text is too to have different reports with different pdf page i used ireport so possibly limitations of ireport listing here and not of jasper one of the things trying to find out asking this question one alternative would be to generate the jrxml myself with just static text but afraid encounter the very same i just generally wasted so much time getting anything done with jasper that i help thinking its not the right tool for the to say that jasper excel in what good is the best free or java reporting library for making

way round it is to redirect the post to a page which redirects to a get see on your post is 4k of form presumably your server does something with that data rather than just displaying it once and throwing it such as saving it in a keep doing or if a huge search form create a temporary copy of it in a database that gets purged after a few days or on a lru basis when a space limit is now create a representation of the data which can be accessed using if generate an id for it and use that as the if a permanent set of data it probably has an id or something that can be used for the at the worst an algorithm like tiny url uses can collapse a big url to a much smaller redirect the post to get the representation of the a historical this technique was practice in

way to handle this is to use events and this will end up creating multiple but it will do so in a manner that means you explicitly create if you create an event handler and add it to the datareceived event of each then when any port receives the event handler will be called on a separate this means the method must be and that access to any shared data structures must be protected against concurrent handler routine will do something like the readexisting to get the data

way you have it implemented is an acceptable way to do what you need to one way to improve your way of doing this would be to use on the dictionary rather than a second object used to synchronize the that rather than passing around an extra the resource itself keeps track of whether a lock on own a separate object can be useful in some such as synchronizing access to outside but in cases like this

what i get is or you split a number into two parts by dividing it by another number and then code the integer result of that division in unary and the remainder in the wikipedia they use 42 as and 10 as so we end up with a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 2 binary so that the resulting message is or 8 bits comma can be the simple binary representation of 42 is or 6 this seems due to the unary representation of which always has to be more bits than missing some important point what is get golomb rice it does make more bits of the or does

what you call amount of code to pass a is the whole this is consistent with its size say only a few hundred incremental approach does not claim to code first and think you can design a code it and then refine the design with special cases or better refactoring does not consist simply in adding new stuff over old for me this is a more destructive where you throw away old code for a simple feature and replace it with new code for a refined and more elaborate	
what you mean by do you mean in the sense that no other process or thread will be selected for scheduling when you run your or do you mean that any shared objects referenced in your function will not be modified by any other threads while your function the you really control that from if on a machine you can guarantee atomicity by raising your process priority to the highest priority possible but even then not guaranteed because your scheduling algorithm may still allow another process to the only reliable way of doing this is from the operating for a machine disable for a machine need to lock the bus and wait for all processes running on other cpus to be taken question here do you want to guarantee in the requirement that only your process may be running and not ought not to exist in if you want to make sure certain data structures are only accessed by one thread at a then you should use a portable thread library for and fence off your function as a critical

will get unless i just run out of a few comments about the answer that references are two types of color interpolation that is some years trilinear interpolation product linear was a common approach for color table trilinear interpolation can indeed be implemented as a sequential set of one dimensional first on one then then along a second years ago we all realized that trilinear interpolation introduces artifacts in color when applied to certain types of the problems are seen in a solution is to move to a simplicial in by dissecting a cube into 6 in n the unit cube will be dissected into there are other dissections of a but this particular style assures that the main diagonal is always a shared edge for all the this in turn restores good behavior for when applied to certain color lookup let me get into the question of true scattered data have mentioned a variety of distance based methods are a i did some work in the past with these i actually preferred the inverse multiquadric all of these are really just variations of radial basis function a common rbf methods have their good and bad they will usually generate a smooth this of course depends on the specific basis function as well as whether you choose to limit the rbf methods also allow you to at least as far out as the support of the radial basis elements will if the basis elements are allowed to be infinite in then no explicit constraint on extrapolation will in general is a bad thing to one problem with rbf methods is they require the solution of large systems of linear and those equation systems are often dense this means the size of the in terms of the number of data points you can handle tends to be limited by the linear if you limit the support by truncating the basis then the matrices can become this will improve the linear algebra if you use a sparse matrix package for the at the same the support distance becomes a nonlinear parameter that you must as methods like multiquadrics and inverse multiquadric methods may have a secondary nonlinear parameter that controls the shape of the basis kriging has similar and lump all of these methods to these all of these methods that classed as rbf variants are often limited in the number of points they will comfortably depending upon how you deal with things and the amount of memory that limit might often be on the order of a few thousand other problem with the general class of rbf methods is what call this is a neologism i created many years ago to describe interpolation across a relatively large hole in the in there may often be problems even when interpolating across smaller holes in the these because they are smooth to some may introduce unwanted extrema peaks or into the interpolated this is a common problem with even often seen as ringing artifacts with cubic spline or polynomial and certainly seen with fourier series the problem in higher dimensions is to even recognize that it has indeed since plotting surfaces in more than three dimensions tends to be you have more points than that or if these ringing artifacts are then other methods are often a better if you are willing to use a linear then the simplest solution in higher dimensions is to start with a tessellation of the thus in 3 tessellate the data a delaunay into this is fairly efficient to and there are many tools to be found for this it is then a simple problem to interpolate any individual merely identify which simplex the point lies compute barycentric coordinates as interpolation weights within the and form the corresponding linear combination of the function values at each vertex of the found this is all extremely fast and downside of these tessellation based methods is they typically restrict you to the convex hull of the data and as if your data happens to lie in a then the interpolant may well do strange things in some regions of your another problem with the scheme i mentioned is the interpolant will only be piecewise but once you move into higher dimensions things get nasty other methods are to be found for smooth interpolation based on a but they will take more effort and are therefore far less basic tradeoffs should be obvious if you need a smooth interpolant and only have a few then rbf methods are often they are easy to the actual method chosen is often just a matter of or even used one tool before and was probably be happy with it since the question was which method is for practical point out that best is a very subjective word when applied out of what are your goals in an interpolation what skill set do you what set of tools do you know how to what environment will you work all of these factors will influence your choice of the best you have many data and speed is of the but ultimate smoothness is not that then you will generally look for a simplicial of if you have sufficient then the piecewise linear nature of the beast is of less the piecewise linear interpolant here has the great virtue in some cases that it can never generate extrema in your surface that did not exist in the for some color characterization for this is of paramount other issue is with while the presence of noise is often a signal that smoothing of some sort is not all such surfaces have smoothing any smoothing operator will sometimes smooth out important features of the data this happens because we can think of a smoothing operator as a low pass high frequency behavior is often but it may also be just a sharp toe or shoulder in my surface that i cannot afford to if this is a then you may be willing to use an interpolant even in the presence of sometimes significant in that suggest that the lowest order interpolant is a more global interpolant will also tend to amplify any noise in the so if you look for the lowest variance interpolant in the presence of it will generally be a linear there are many varieties of thin plate interpolatory or once you go beyond one your options also at least if you are willing to do the end here before it turns into a

would look first at the why you want to do normally applications operate like there is no issue in 2 clients doing inserts at the same time besides wrong approaches in the the solution will vary with the one option is to have a microsoft message queue and move the inserts out of those so the load of the inserts is controlled by the process that reads form the i still fail to see why you want to avoid the inserts from running in parallel from what i read in the other responses i think others do i will quote 2 of your comments on reason i want this is because in the case of a power i lost only one transaction instead of the because before the there are other lengthy jobs that require only when during the insertion there is a need for sequential i read the first i would actually think a reason to want them in you want to be done with them as fast as going sequential will actually increase the time to make the so there is more time where the power surge can the it makes me think that you are probably more concerned in the effect of these processes running on parallel and the insert not getting into the this again means you want to be done with the inserts so not a reason to do them you might have a case for a distributed transaction that also includes the file system was looking at the file system but i recall if they ever did something on the newer distributed transactions are kind of a pain to set up though and access to the ports it good path i have is adding more info to the process to be able to tell where it you might not even code an automatic recovery process but at least you know you will have the info for sure to know something went simplest way is an insert at the beginning of the process and have a flag to signal when it was if it is a long running process you might want to have something more like an status you keep updating to be able to tell in which step it an alternative is writing the status to the file any case it will only tell you that the last step that completed not whether the current step was or not able to be this is what makes the retry logic a bit more as you just continue where it you have to check whether the last step was or not and that depends on each if the above is the it is hard to tell from the you might want to open a different question about long running processes automatic

written a vsto plugin for ms project 2007 which basically just publishes project data to our sharepoint to do the user has to enter in the sharepoint site name into our plugin everytime that they want to do i persist this information so that the user only has to enter the information like to save it as part of the project file so that portable from user to if not settle for it just persisting on a single best solution i have so is to just store a mapping of project filenames to sharepoint sites in the temp but that just seem like the cleanest way to do do i save preferences for my vsto	
written some stuff you may be interested in about the java sort algorithm and taken performance measurements of the algorithm at present is a with an insertion once you get down to a certain size of sublists this algorithm is very probably going to change in java should really take the big o notation as an indication of how the algorithm will scale for a particular the precise time will deviate from the time predicted by this calculation see on my the two sort algorithms that are combined each have different performance and so the overall time for a sort is a bit more as a rough for every time you double the number of if you multiply the expected time by you be far make much sense really to do this for very small lists of a few

you able to change the output to use ul instead of a you then you might want to take a look at treeview what i use for all semantically more appropriate to use an ul rather than a table for a but in your case would depend on having the chance of changing the code at in case you i think you fade out i had a similar problem in the so suggest fading out the inner table then hiding the no point in calling 3 faster and more readable if you just do again after you the inner innertable else

you need to compare using one of the build in equivalence you can use or depending on whether you want to look for equality using or b b b b you can these functions return the sublist starting at the first matching element if they find an this is because if you are searching a list that may contain you need to be able to distinguish the case of finding a from the case of not finding the element you are looking a list is a true value only false value in scheme is so you can use the result of or in any context expecting a such as an or b is the difference between the three different based on which equivalence function they use for thus tests if two objects are the same underlying it is basically equivalent to a pointer comparison direct value comparison in the case of two strings or lists that look the same may not be because they are stored in different locations in thus performs a deep comparison on lists and and so basically any two items that print the same will be is like for almost anything but for two numbers that are numerically equivalent will always be but they may not be is because of bignums and rational which may be stored in ways such that they be that some behavior of the functions is undefined by the and thus may differ from implementation to i have included examples that should work in any compatible scheme that implements exact rational you need to search for an item in a list using an equivalence predicate different than one of the built in then you may want or from x 2 3 4 5 5

you run an entire website off of a single and that machine is more than enough to handle your then images are not a bottleneck that needs solving right forget about s3 for as your server gets you will want your server to be spending all of its time doing server transferring static content like flat html files and images is an dumb and wasting precious active and cpu cycles on them is no by switching to your server can concentrate on doing which is whatever your program actually also has benefits of being distributed around and attached to probably a fatter pipe than your which means the images will show up slightly more quickly on your so an added is also backed which means that it makes for a pretty nice place to store pretty much any private data under the in addition to stuff that you want to serve to others confuse the permissions settings between those two things in you may want to use separate accounts is also which means that if you want to let users upload files to your site s3 is a great choice so that you have to constantly worry if your server is going to run out of disk space warning like i said at the if a setup with a handful of none of this really a tool like any and it may not be something you need

you say you touch sound in your i doubt your code doing does it occur if you run any other what happens if you mute various channels in the mixer on knowing anything else venture a guess that it could be related to the fan on your graphics if your programs cause the fan to turn on and either close to your sound card or the power line crosses an audio it could cause some try moving any audio cables as far as possible from the fan and power cables and see what could also be picking up static from a number of other and i say necessarily if programs cause this as it could be or even certain frequencies of usage being picked up on an audio line like an you can also try to reduce the number of loops in your audio wires and see if it but no	
you saying that they want to do text if the they will ruin the ability to do meaningful reporting on the because i can guarantee that they will not consistently enter the they are going to be entering one of several preset strings grades of then make a lookup table for those strings which maps to numeric values for they really want to be able to start entering in text and you dissuade them from add another column along the lines of have a predefined value that means to put in your value that when doing reporting you can either roll up all of those random values or you can simply ignore make sure that you add the into your systemcodes table so that you can keep a foreign key between that and the results if you already have then you should definitely consider adding

you should considered using some sort of tool tip window to display the notification a tool tip will not steal focus from you main window when it is displayed or when a user clicks on a regular form will have a border by default and if the user clicks on that border your main form will loose is some basic code to do the tip disappears when free is however you would be better off setting a timer than using	
you should know that masterpages actually sit inside so much so that a load event is actually called after your load the page object is actually the highest control in the control knowing the best way to find any control in such a nested is to write a recursive function that loops through every control and child controls until it finds the one looking in this your masterpages are actually child controls of the main page get to the main page object from inside any control like find that the class method is pretty as the enviroment is always if decided to use new extension features to extend the control using the code below in your appcode all your controls will now peform a recursive find by calling public module public function sourcecontrol as byref controlid as as if not return return end end private function concol as byref controlid as as dim retcontrol as for each con as control in if controlid isnot nothing if controlid return end if typeof con is genericcontroltype return end end if if controlid isnot nothing retcontrol retcontrol end if retcontrol isnot nothing return end end return end

you take care of the correct bundle start there is a way to set the start level of every so that your system can bootstrap the correct start level of bundles might be required if some activators try to get services in case the services are not the service consumers will just be to set the proper start levels for your bundles and see whether it concretely you would have to start the bundle with the jdbc drivers first before the hibernate problem might be that you have some unsolved make sure that everythingg is you can do this by getting an osgi console and asking for a list of in equinox this boils down to the commandline argument and the followed by commands in the osgi to your drivers are registerd by their hibernate then probably looks up a driver by its no need to import specific driver this anyway would introduce an undesired dependency on an implementation specific

your own product your is part of quality assurance and i would put it under informal testing category as opposed to more formal testing usually done by a separate qa your is aimed at giving a experience of using a product or service to people directly responsible for its design and for a feature rich application it might go deeper than formal testing and at the same time put a specific user when the formal testing normally covers breadth of software use cases and tries to operate in more objective and measurable annoyances that make is also a category of shortcomings very specific to an environment that can be only diagnosed the this really annoying rattling sound that seems to be coming from nowhere whenever cruising at and drives you absolutely yet none of the mechanics is nor willing to get down to the cause when the car is at the software application set of your own product goes far beyond the software it unavoidably encompasses the entire your dog lets to develop and better understand the techniques of using the software within a it is fair to say that some software is used within a number of widely different formal testing might not be able to cover each of these contexts in simply because it might be difficult to define formally what specific tests you need to do once something has or it might be too expensive to mimic these contexts inhouse or go through all the known tests cases every time the software has slightly change testing is really good at checking that changes done to the software do but the other important area of evolution where formal testing is struggling is when you need to detect the changes in the software environment or usage patterns that come from the external using your own product will help detecting these changes much probably before told by the users on the quality of the user feedback is wrong with such there is no balance to strike between using your own product and formally testing it both as much as it is returns getting are worth the one is to compliment not to serve as a should do the is unless there is no dedicated resource to do the formal testing developers doing all the and you have to select how much time you can dedicate to any of the two important distinction here is that formal testing is best done by an independent people who report to the development and design on the other hand everyone marketers and even in should be using company products or services as much as because the core idea behind is to give everyone involved the experience of service or product they contribute to in a real life dogfood or can far as dogfood certain types of argument let not concentrate on how dogfooding eating your but rather think instead of what it getting a experience and with these of the actual next best thing to eating the food yourself is observing the dog whilst it eats the as opposed to relying on someone else telling you what your likes or the dev team members may not be able to personally put sewage control software to use in their everyday jobs nothing stops them from spending some time regularly observing a sewage engineer using the which follow the letter of but certainly captures it
