a class hierarchy where the base class defines a recursive class extends can i declare another class should not be generic in because such a t could vary over the lifetime of the with a field that can hold any subclass of following does not class b to because the capture of is not sufficiently private public extends end of question noticed a tendency of a number of stackoverflow members to approach certain difficult questions with are you doing that in the first the following is a justification of my use of this pattern you can note that the java standard library also uses recursive in its definition of the enum this question could similarly be asked as to define a field of type class extends public abtract t public return asub1 extends public asub1 return asub2 extends public asub2 return to a parallel class class extends extends implements extends implements with generation of b instances managed by implementations of a bifyer bifyer of this interface may return a bsub1 or bsub2 for the this is essentially an application of the visitor pattern where the bifyer is the but unlike the standard visitor the accept method returns a value instead of this provides a modular framework where different bifyer implementations can be specified to provide alternate behavior and return types for the bify method say one for each subclass of field type for a value of a generically recursive

a content based on the value selected in the first data returns queries on a linq2sql datacontext a total rookie at this i battled for hours on end trying to figure out what was wrong my understanding of the when i hard coded my everything worked but as soon as i tried to query a linq2sql all sorts of wierd stuff started to happen when i duplicated the query results into a new object everything worked forgive my lack of linguistic prowess when it comes to i think it has to do with the of when i create another list representing the queried all is but if i try to use the queried data world falls apart without erroring too which made it hard to figure would basically like a reference to or an explanation of and a especially in these calling the code below hope it makes sense thank you in advance it was just a new text a case value it worked just then i tried jsonresult return failed no javascript no compilation figure it out until i tried dumping the data into a new list manually and i finally settled jsonresult list returnlist new text a case value value text return cascading dropdownlist issues with	
a diagram that should make things more developing a plugin for another program that adds relationships and properties not already included in the these are defined in my tree trying to define this structure abstractly so that i could create implementations of the plugin for different as well as access the information from multiple implementations in a single methods are defined in the but the framework does not know about all the i was hoping i could avoid having the implementation projects pass a list of types to the methods in the framework but it seems i avoid i guess that make sense the methods must have access to the types they are this really explain the problem with as it is a concrete class in the framework i think what is happening is when i serialize the datacontractserializer has access to all the objects and their knowtype parameter and saves them but when i deserialize i create my datacontractserializer with dictionary as the so it only knows about but not the derived classes of tell it what all the derived types are because like i said they are in other projects that the framework project know soooooooo seems like the best solution is to have each implementation pass a list of node types it uses to the serialization and deserialization methods in the framework this make is there a better way to do

a is not a the reverse is you could cast a myobjectcollection to a list because myobjectcollection inherits from and for all intents and is a only thing you can do is to define a constructor on myobjectcollection that takes an ienumerable as a parameter and initalizes itself with the data in the other but that will make a new object containing the same class myobjectcollection public noted in the you could have the cast succeed at provided that dosomething actually returns an instance of if it the object effectively is a and the cast is completely have to it is bad practice in my view to upcast something like if the function returns a you should not rely on a specific implementation of either modify the return type of if you own that and return a or deal with it as a

a pointer to a function is very useful in a variety of it allows you to refer to functions as which lets you at which function you will use for this is in say i want some background process to work for a and let us know when done we can update the or but we may want this background process to call one and we want it to call a different rather than writing two versions of this background we can write it so that the background process receives a pointer to the function we want it to when the process is it calls whichever function it was given in the first it just lets you have a heap more flexibility in deciding which method to in that quite similar to in behind the i believe uses pointers to functions to facilitate polymorphism storing a different table of pointers to functions for each

actually what you do is to deal with conditional is when a get request does go from client to asking you have anything newer than and the server say 304 if do avoid the server generating the and the traffic of the js however the cost of the request is sending an http request from browser to is still stuff is being handled by the headers for one for the etag is a different thing that is when the browser decides not to issue the get request at it is being managed by the header or the might have a header being setup somewhere and it makes the client disregard the setting or something like and see if the request is being cached about fb instead setup a breakpoint or logging on the server to be sure that not being said that when dealing with files you might not actual that is because if the browser does decide to say for a then you cannot force it to reload a new so if you deploy a new version to the the client see it until the week has no matter what the new time of the new resource is cuz it will never even issue the conditional get solution you really want to relieve network is to setup caching for maximum time a and when the resource you change the uri is add an arbitrary querystring this will force the browser to reload the new js and never bother the server at least until the next update next resource uri

addition to what others have already there are also benefits specific to using cloud services by companies like what some might is not inherently in most quite the opposite this is because most companies do not have the resources to provide the level of reliability and redundancy that like microsoft or amazon unless you are hosting source code for a defense project or other projects where the threat of espionage is very the greatest threats to your code and your business are more mundane things like cloud services provide levels of redundancy that most businesses simply cannot obtain on their this includes data redundancy hardware redundancy and geographical redundancy server locations across the if a natural disaster hits your is your data going to be each small business by itself cannot afford support staff and dollar but pooling their resources together through a cloud service affords them centralization and better resource access to a much higher level of related to by centralizing the data of thousands of this allows security resources to be much more tightly it should be noted that most commercial hosting providers offer and dedicated and even cloud service providers allow customers to configure their however they and whatever applications on it they so you can have a great deal more freedom than that offered by web

agree that it may seem like overkill to have an business layer but my question if the business classes are essentially empty wrappers for the dal is the business logic in the app being in these i often see it spread throughout the ui and dal code in the which defeats the entire purpose of having a business layer in the first you are going to have a business then it should encapsulate as much of the business logic as including validation and various methods of if you essentially let the business layer be a bunch of data transfer it is not providing any value and you should probably consider developing your architecture without

all in the in many not databases will need some level of customization for individual but generalized databases can provide a basic level of it is possible to design something that is general enough to serve many basic but the problem is that that generality of design tends to lead to high for you can design your database to be for a large set of potential user but just better to customize the schema to the individual needs of the are significant tradeoffs involved in designing for a reusability usually they involve time and easier to design something that is not and the additional amount of time invovled in making the general design and using it is not worth the

an expression like 2 you usually test bits by shifting the constant 1 to the since that lets the number of bits shifted be the same as the index of the counting the lsb bit as bit number no point in testing the result with a since always going to be either 0 or so you can at least test for something simpler if your language requires c and which by default interpret a integer as the comparison is totally unnecessary and just serves to introduce and increase the risk of write this like extra parenthesis should help make it clearer how things are note how was rewritten as this is not just a you need to compute the proper shift to get the same bit 4 in this course you could put the into subroutines and call to make the code more

an onmouseover or mousemove think both of these event to the body and when you hover over your actual you can handle what you need to do as it will bubble up to the body where you can handle the element you actually moused you can use custom attributes or expando properties of that element to handle what ever you need to do in the mouseover for the specific should really only be attaching events as you need them and detaching them when you no longer need on trivial pages this is probably not but in a scenario like it will improve we used to do stuff like this where i worked when we would have thousands of form elements on a two

answer the exact there but pretty and it will purely be a you need runtime use a and based on your updated you may have misunderstood how they you need something you can use to represent the of a at compile in everything apart from integers has to be represented by so use a type to represent a a member of type integer that stores a and another for storing their last age typedef int typedef you need something like a that does lookup at compile called it give it support for up to 8 firstly we need a placeholder to represent the absence of a none struct we can the shape of class t0 class t1 class t2 class t3 class t4 class t5 class t6 class t7 then specialise this for the case where there are no void int reason for this will be come clear in a the definition for all other class class class class class class class class struct ctmap public typedef using typename typename t0 return the going on if you will build a type for by recursively expanding the because from and we provide storage for the first field and then discard it when we this all comes to a sudden stop when there are no more because the specialization for kicks we can like looking up in a but at compile using a class as the means we can also do a function that prints one where the member to be printed is a type so we can call it like you can write a thing that is a little like a a little like a

answers computational logic for applicative common is a software system consisting of a programming an extensible theory in a and a mechanical theorem computer cons or is a fundamental function in most dialects of the lisp programming cons constructs the memory objects which hold two values or pointers to these objects are referred to as or in lisp the expression cons x onto means to construct a new object with x the resulting pair has a left referred to as the car first and a right half second referred to as the hons is merely another name for the following is an acl2 x x generally runs slower than cons because in creating a an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and this involves search and the use of your cons with some classes and compare their instances with reference appears that is the process of hashing a lisp constructor to determine if an object already exists via equality

are two questions around the main is too if the elements lie in then use banded storage of the bands as vectors offset from the main if the elements are scattered randomly in the vicinity of the main then either use a banded form that may include some zeros in the or use a pure sparse form that stores only the elements and their positions in the will you do with the if your goal is merely efficient then a banded form will be with fast access to any if you will do linear algebra with the but never more than then the banded form will still work if you work with multiplies or matrix where becomes a then a pure sparse form may be more for the product of two banded matrices will have additional so the product of two tridiagonal matrices will be for a reorderings will sometimes be useful to minimize is one approximate minimum degree but there are other

calculate the probability of collisions with strings of length with bits per character to a hash of length bits assuming an optimal you could calculate the collision probability based on a hash table of size of things first we can assume a ideal hashtable implementation that splits the bits in the hash perfectly into the available buckets this means becomes meaningless except as a limit for and are simply the basis for an upper bound for for simpler maths assume that strings length are simply padded to l with a special null if we were interested we are interested in the worst case this is plainly this is a ludicrous the actual number of entries is more useful than the character set and the length so we will simply work as if was a variable in own are left trying to put items into then becomes a very well known the this for various probabilities and number of buckets is but assuming we have 1 billion buckets about 4gb of memory in a 32 bit then we would need only 37k entries before we hit a chance of their being at least one given that trying to avoid collisions in a hashtable becomes plainly this does not mean that we should not about the behaviour of our hash clearly these numbers are assuming they are an upper bound on how good we can a poor hash function can give far worse collisions in some waste some of the possible by never or rarely using it all of which can cause hashes to be less than optimal and even degrade to a performance that looks like a list but with much constant implementation of the hash function is not great that it could be but is probably acceptable for the vast majority of users and is reasonably efficient to alternative perfect you wish you can generate what are known as this requires full knowledge of the input values in advance however so is not often in a simliar vein to the above maths we can show that even perfect hashing has the limit of of 54 strings of length however we only have bits shall assume which is about 4 billion different so if you can have truly string and any number of them then you have to l 2 solving log2 54 32 log2 54 string lengths clearly be you are left with a maximum length of just very short you know that you will only ever have a set of strings well below 4 billion in size then perfect hashing would let you handle any value of but restricting the set of values can be very hard in practice and you must know them all in advance or degrade to what amounts to a database of string hash and add to it as new strings are this exercise the universal hash is optimal as we wish to reduce the probability of collision for any input the probability of it having output x from a set of possibilities r is that doing an optimal job on the hashing the internal is quite hard but that you should expect the built in types to be reasonable if not always this example i have avoided the question of closed and open this does have some bearing on the probabilities involved but not

came across a few months ago while working my way through some and was to say the for every 20 line python solution i be a gobsmacking 20 j solution that ran in a tenth of the been keen to learn some basic and have made a few attempts at picking up the but have found the learning curve to be quite those who are familiar with these would you recommend investing some time to learn one thinking j in i would do so more for the purpose of satisfying my curiosity than for career advancement or some such personal circumstances to if you care love and use it daily in my work a mathematician for a but to be honest i really feel limited by the tools that i use python so i use that have no particular desire to work in the finance which seems to be the main port of call for k users at plus i should really learn as a next language as the primary language where i so practically j almost definitely be the next language i reasonably familiar with matlab so using an programming language constitute a tremendous paradigm advice from those familiar with these languages would be much anybody recommend learning

can you prove the orm is stopping your sometimes performance problems are simply poor database or improper usually this comes from trying to orm onto a legacy database stored procedures and triggers can have adverse impact on performance especially when working with django where the trigger code is expected to be in the python model poor performance is an application this includes needless operations being done in the most common performance problem is an application that casually using the method and creating large this will crush the django query sets have to be touched as little as possible so that the query set iterator is given to the template for you choose to bypass the you have to fight out the impedance mismatch relational has no concept of it has to be a fetch of a relational set using foreign to assemble a complex object model via sql is simply circular references make this very resolving into collections is going to use raw you have two it exist and painful to your own a common approach is to add stateful getters that check a private cache to see if fetched the related object and if the object fetch the related object from the database and update the the process of inventing your own stateful be reinventing and probably discover that it the orm but a database design or an application design

canonical solution for this is to use a block in the top and the full node in content most basic way of achieving this is to simply display the node page normally with a theme having the content top region zen classic create a views block containing the list you want and place it in that you can use the path as the argument to the view so its contents can depend on the currently displayed define the visibility of the block to only match the conditions you probably to display only on node or maybe on node pages of a specific content for use the php visibility mode for the and do something like filter args for return return way the block will be displayed only when you want your theme does not have this panels provide a way for you to divide the page and place the view in one panel and the full node in an other

casts are generally needed when a loss of precision between the two for if you had an int and assigned it to a no cast is necessary since long can hold all values that an int if you were assigning a long to an a cast would be required as int can hold less values than a long which can lead to data m defines the number as a decimal if you omit the number is interpreted as a

classic example that joel spolsky uses is on of strcat and and spotting the algorithms in not that you need c to solve problems that languages that knowing c well gives you a perspective on going on underneath all those levels of languages that allows you to write better because just such a perspective helps you avoid writing code which unknown to actually for some clarification based on c is not a prerequisite for such there are many ways to acquire the same c is also not a guarantee of these you may be proficient in c and yet still write kludgy code in every other language you is a yet it still has modern control structures and functions so you always getting caught up in the fiddly very difficult to become proficient at c without gaining a mastery of certain fundamentals as the details of memory management and mastery of which often pays rich dividends when working in any always about the is true in many pursuits as well as software it is not secret incantations that make the best programmers the rather it is a greater mastery of the experience has shown that knowledge of c tends to have a higher correlation to mastery of certain of those and that learning c tends to be one of the easier and more common routes to acquiring such

currently in the middle of porting a fairly large perl the problem is that it uses little perl tricks to make its code available for done about the same with making the codebase one big module for had a firm grasp of python for a long but i have no experience with large projects written in python that need to access other parts of itself while maintaining an internal yet tried simply importing the entire thing in one line but i know currently not doing things in the best of an example from the master script that sets everything in but not happy with right the master class script imports each piece of the module and creates an instance of the contained passing itself as an argument to in those like def the code in that class can access the entire rest of the codebase through the parent my question is considering the what would be the best way to reorganize the project and refactor the code so that it retains its current ability to access everything the code is very so not worried about internal data i just like having to go through the parent class in such an ugly and those long chains slow the code down as forgot links to the svn repos for both mine is and the project porting is a large python project that must share an internal

guido himself announced that the reverse domain convention ought to be it be unless there were significant changes to the implementation of in python searches an import path at with a java searches a path with an exhaustive algorithm both at and go try arranging your directories like import import one of those statements will because either or comes higher on the search when python sees it grabs the first package it if that happens to contain then the first will if it throws an and gives because must occur at potentially at any point in the flow of the code most often at the nobody wants an exhaustive at that point to verify that no possible it assumes that if it finds a package named it is python distinguish between the following com import import import concept of verifying that is is going to be different in each in you really only have to deal with the second and that can be accomplished by walking through the file system guess an advantage of naming classes and files the in if you tried to accomplish import with nothing but file system the first case could be transparently the same the second case could be but you would lose the initial running of but the third case is entirely the code has to execute for to be and this is another main does more than resolve it executes you get away with this if every python package ever distributed required an installation process that searched for the and then the and so on and so but this makes packaging considerably destroys and makes packaging and

have a problem with i think i understand what the issue but i test that understanding and ask if anyone has seen this before or can workaround or an alternate please bear with this is a which is difficult to break down to a minimal test writing a interface to a legacy messaging i have the interop assembly for a direct interface and that all works of it is that i have a class for each message and a generic passing around that just occupies the same space as a maximal size message class implements cast operators to cast into and out of called the generic class and the individual are both derived from a bodyless minimal message a client to send a message just calls a send method in an interface assembly a casting into the generic type for the receiver event the receiving app a generic which be cast according to a common which has a relationship with the message have implemented the local direct interface and this all works i can now message between the test application and existing native the basic class structure looks like class a message class generic message defines an empty class some irrelevant cast operators to convert to and from the abstract message public static implicit operator some irrelevant public static implicit operator some irrelevant the cast comes the i want to extend this interface to support group of developers overseas can communicate via wcf with an service i have this is with an admirable lack the the exposes for test purposes method which takes a string and converts this into a message legacy this also works with a call to the function in my application being converted into a legacy message and sent to i tried to extend the interface to add an entrypoint which would accept a in the hope that this would work the same way as the direct the sender would cast their message into a sending function with this and the adapter would simply pass generic message into its local interface assembly for so the wcf code would look pretty much exactly like the normal messaging interface void dialout void dispatch i extended the client and the proxy code for the wcf client the client seems that the client app cannot understand the cast and throws a even if i include the messaging assembly with the code above a the client code the type defined in the generated and ignores the original message so it cannot the cast this is the type in with the imported type in using the type defined in far as i can the class defined in the generated proxy is of course the generated proxy class only defines data not contains two partial class whole slew of data partial class extra stuff to define the added can leave the assembly reference so the code see the cast and fails or i can leave the reference in and the compiler wilfully ignores type definition and uses the proxy and fails to other wcf developers seen this kind of thing or does everyone simple value parameters when calling wcf am i just going to have to an endpoint with a unique class parameter for every kind of message want to this is a maintenance type

have a very strange my application stack is j2ee based and uses spring with spring webflow the app server is weblogic with an apache server in front we use siteminder webagent as the authentication layer in problem below could be caused by any of the layers above site performance is very slow and the reason certain javascript and css files are not being we know that siteminder strips away the header so we enabled ignoreext parameter add extension to existing list of unprotected file types this no js or css files were the problem now is that i see only 2 files not being cached the server does not return a and the reason being the response headers are the server does return a 304 but there ae some junk text in the headers and therefore the client is not able to decide where to get the content it looks like this this could be known problems with the 2 files of spring or a configuration in apache with siteminder or something else anybody ever come across any idea where to start http headers on	
have a whole lot to add to the great answers so but here are a few things to consider and to make this is the catch all it is easy to assume things that are region or language specific and it is hard to notice these very careful with string there are some such as which have letters that are similar to others visually but which are pseudo translation as a smoke if you read your translated strings from a resource create a pseudo translated version of the file that is still understandable to you but which stresses the capacity and capability of every translatable string in the for pad out a string like with something like so that it is as wide as your allowance for translated then you can test to verify that every string will display extra credit for also sticking in the most complex character likely to be rendered to verify that it displays correctly in all make assumptions about keyboard may be a great control set of directional keys for qwerty but hard coding that makes it if not to use for people with other keyboard various date then test them i have seen issues due to something as small as a different format for in regional the also comes up a but every setting here can various number then test them you do not want to depend on decimal or thousands for with and without a user logged in to the this may be more windows but it is very easy to get a component on the server configured such that it uses the logged in regional settings while a user is logged in and a default regional setting when the user is not logged this can cause intermittent with various regional and language as an not only does windows have regional and language but ie has its own language the behavior of an ie client with listed first may not always be the same as one with listed for sure your translator understands the business and the then cross check with someone be very careful any time you use application specific if your program uses specific words to mean something special in the make sure they are translated in a similar way in every including in the help if you have specific language you might even go so far as to translate such words ahead of time and make sure they translate poorly in the target this is more of a product research but it can make a difference in what words are used in the and it is easier on everyone if those words are in place from the you also want to avoid idioms that may not translate i had more to say than i

have not used the but i believe those lines are error they would be going to instead of standard and so they are going directly to your terminal instead of through the they be filtered by your sed you could filter them by merging your standard error and standard output but looks like not sure because you are missing the you are trying to call find is returning all of the files and notes on what you might want to looks like has a for you may want to of the find you do wish to use a you can limit it to only files using instead of files and you need to pass into a find command may confuse if there are files that have names that looks like the options that passing in will search recursively through the current if you wish to use slashes in your it can be a pain to quote them correctly with you can instead choose a different character to delimit your regular will use the first character after the command as a your pattern is also lacking a in regular to indicate one instance of any character you use and to indicate or more of the preceding you use so indicates or more of any is different from glob in which alone means or more of any you really do want to be including your standard error stream in your standard so it will pass through the then you can awk you just want to ignore you can redirect that to which is a special file that just discards anything that goes into awk i think the command below will help you with your immediate and the other suggestions listed above may help you if i did not undersand what you were looking awk print

have several sql server 2000 databases we need to that have the same structure and have them set up to replicate to another the problem is that whenever i have to change the structure is usually pretty easy to do on all especially with tools from red i have to stop the make the structure and then set up replication the steps to set up replication only take a few minutes to do for each database but repetitive and drives me i have the ide create a script of the replication procedure and then just replace the name of the prior database with the name of the next database and run the still annoying but faster than clicking though the ide and forgetting an tried things like using the but that look very guess is i should just use the tsql that gets generated from the ide and use that as a starting point to build a new tsql script have it pass the name of the database as a and then when something changes with the structure of the database i need to address that in the tsql replication script and make the changes is this an issue for anyone does 2005 or 2008 have a better so i have to mainting some crazy script and just have the ide generate a script when there are changes that i could then use on multiple databases the same replication script on several

have used subsonic on a number of my projects and would argue that subsonic scales exceptionally subsonic like most technologies can be used for good or say for example you have some table on a page with a gazillion columns and gobs of you could write a stored procedure to get the data creates wrappers around all of your stored you could create a view in the database so that if your db is smart it can optimize the views performance creates a class for each of your views as well as say you use a view and want any of the overhead of a collection of with subsonic you can just get an idatareader for your that fast enough for you i know what the other hand lets say in the same app you also have 5 or so tables with only columns and 10 or so rows used for administration and you can now use one of subsonics nifty controls the scaffold which will create a gridview with built in functionality for the table by just dropping it on the has a lot of time saving functionality built into it and when you want to do it your now and then we all say my way or the high subsonic will allow you to do it your

have worked on both green field project with fully unit tested code bases and large applications that have grown over many years and with many different developers on i would not bother an attempt to get a legacy code base to the state where units tests and test first development can add a lot of a legacy code base gets to a certain size and complexity getting it to the point where unit test coverage provides you with a lot of benefits becomes a task equivalent to a full main problem is that as soon as you start refactoring for testability you will begin introducing and only once you get high test coverage can you expect all those new bugs to be found and means that you either go very slowly and carefully and you do not get the benefits of a well unit tested code base until years from never since mergers etc in the mean time you are probably introducing some new bugs with no apparent value to the end user of the you go fast but have an unstable code base until all you have reached high test coverage of all your you end up with 2 one in one for the cause this all a matter of scale for some projects a rewrite might just take a few weeks and can certainly be worth

having some trouble getting a indexing program to i have a form that automatically downloads urls to index from a database server and sends back responses containing the indexed page over i have a static class called udp that keeps track of incoming and outgoing there is an event that fires whenever a message is which the form that contains all the indexing code hooks to keep track of messages sent from a program on the server that holds the database of urls to was all working until i added another form that appears before the indexing the indexing form opens on another thread and a second the problem the event handler is no longer called when the event is the question what is going on and what can i do to fix pretty sure it has to do with some safety mechanism that call event handlers on another thread than the one the event was fired does anybody know of a different way to do this or a way to circumvent thanks in can i get an event handler to be called from a seperate thread than the one it was created

how i would start sketching it have a course object which accepts a requirements object and a oncompleteactions object in its granted i would make the constructor internal and create a coursebuilder that will know how to build all of the different courses ever the course is updated it checks if the requirements are met by passing itself to the requirements if it meets the requirements it then passes itself to the void if object is nothing but an aggregate list of irequirement which you could fine tune based on the course that you the aremetby method simple enumerates all of your irequirements in the list and checks to see if your course satisfies them irequirement public bool you could have all sorts of different requirements that implement coursehoursrequirement public public bool return idea for the oncompleteactions would have a list of one or more ioncompleteaction that would execute each encapsulating each possible requirement in its own class you can then build a course that would have a a you could easily add new requirements as you go because they are all implementing the same you probably have to add some limit properties as you go but the real work is done inside of the

i did not know that actionscript used the word in that are two separate concepts at work inheritance and the term is used in both cases in and many other a class which inherits from another refers to that class as its while many people use the term in fact you could quite legitimately use the word as the names this is object on the other is what described with the example of the car and a car is composed of several other one or more of which is the i must not often heard the term used in this context to refer to the probably find most people in the world would recognize the by the label in the case of a data structure like an xml we often talk about parent nodes and child the parent contains the so using the word in a composition relationship is also apposite depending on the type of i think find many programmers using the word in composition scenarios outside of a tree distinction is often likened to a versus identity versus in the child subtype of its in on the other the car or a parent node in a tree collection of child kendall below added some good comments on the part of your question related to instances and passing if you have a particular block of code and a specific error please feel free to update your question with them and try to

i found a way around this the only reason doing it this way is because i find any other way to fix this and because in my integration so not concerned about this having adverse effects in production had to add a property to my datacontext to act as a flag to keep track of whether or not to dispose of the connection object when my datacontext is being this the connection is kept alive throughout the entire transaction and therefore no longer bothers sample of my new static bool supressconnectiondispose void if if null 0 if allows my integration tests to take the form void var transaction new would not recommend utilizing this in production but for integration tests i think it is also keep in mind this only works for connections where the server is always the as well as the hope this helps anyone else who runs into the same problem i

i incorrectly assumed it had to do with sql it appears actually a php related to you trying to print out array elements that all of your prints that include elements of you need to make sure that there are actually columns named that being returned by your if not a column named that attempt to print it is going to generate the since this got bumped i guess go into a little more of as bobince points you have sql injection the first line should will always be an and if it could be a is generally bad especially in a case with i know exactly which tables particular fields come but your query should look more like where you select only the fields actually going to updates join clients on join pages on join projects on gets set to exactly the same value as already so kind of a pointless on the last you echo not sure what expecting this to but going to assign to and then end up printing out or or probably not what you were going you both try to select from and join you do at least without giving one of them an

implementing a interface i always assign to the out parameters on success but should i do so also on long if return if is this return return one time i was bit on the nose by not initializing an out parameter and assuming that if i initialized the variable it will remain that value if i change it inside the however i used this method from and since the marshaller sees that this is an parameter it discarded the initial value i placed on the call site and put in garbage after the function returned was fun debugging assigning to an param even on failure overcompensation or should i really do even though formally one should not access out params if the function failed i often see sometimes code like this the example from hres is assumes that if getsmth failed then psmth is still works fine in code but if a marshaller is involved is it smart enough to only set the return value if the function out params be set even if com function

is a case of premature unoptimization you should never do something because you think it will be you has extra if you have no need of the extra features of arraylist then it is wasteful to use an for some of the things you can do with a list there is the arrays which means that the arraylist provided more functionality than arrays is less now using those might be slower than using an but it would have to be profiled to be should never try to make something faster without being sure that it is slow to begin which would imply that you should go ahead and use arraylist until you find out that they are a problem and slow the program however there should be common sense involved too arraylist has the overhead will be small but it will not be easy to spot in a as all it is is a little overhead and a little overhead so common sense would unless you need the features of arraylist you should not make use of unless you want to die by a thousands cuts internal if you find that you do need to change from arrays to arraylist the chance is pretty straight forward in most cases becomes that will be of the you are using the look value then there is no code to change for that as going with what you equal access depending on your for instance the android vm inline methods is just a straight interpreter as far as i so the access on that will be much there are other operations on an arraylist that can cause depends on what you are regardless of the vm could be faster with a stright again you would have to profile or examine the source to be wrappers increase the amount of memory being should not worry about before you profile on the other hand you choose what you know to be a slower option unless you have a good reason	
is a classic if comparing every polygon with every other run into a if you build a table as you step through all the then march through the table you get a nice i ask a similar question during you have the memory you want to create a multimap multiple with each vertex as the and the polygon as the then you can walk each polygon exactly inserting the vertex and polygon into the if the vertex already you add the polygon as an additional entry to that vertex hit all the you walk the entire map once and do whatever you need to do with any vertex that has more than one polygon

is a fairly large set of differences between these two technologies that cannot be really covered in a short so but try to cover the linq2sql you write your queries over in memory under the hood though the code you write is translated to expression trees and is further translated to sql at runtime where the query is actually in you directly build sql queries which are run against the has direct language support in and provides support for string based query which have 0 language support other than just a raw language support in linq2sql makes queries type in all query results must be converted to the appropriate type which essentially removes type safety

is a language that to the introduction of nullable the standard so the behavior of the compiler had to change to handle a new rule like can be assigned a value of null to a struct is generally but a rule the compiler enforces when generating the since the compiler parses all your code and figures out what it it can recognize all kinds of even ones to may appear to be if the compiler parses your code and finds that assigning null to a it outputs an if it finds that your assigning null to a then it knows how to handle it and generates the appropriate the type implicit conversion exists from the null type to any nullable this conversion produces the null value of the given nullable default value of a nullable type is an instance for which the hasvalue property is referencing the value property of a default value of a nullable type results in an exception of type the default value is also known as the null value of the nullable an implicit conversion exists from the null type to any nullable and this conversion produces the null value of the

is an awesome tool that disassembles an exe into readable instructions and allows you to execute the instructions it also tells you what api functions the program uses and if the arguments that it provides long as the arguments are found on the cpu instructions are of variable some are one others are some some four it mostly depends on the kind of data that the instruction some instructions are like which tells the cpu to move data from a cpu register to a place in or vice in there are many different ones for handling ones for moving data from different registers and so could pick up paul assembly language which is a free entry level book that talks about assembly and how the intel 386 cpu most of it is applicable even to modern day consumer intel exe format is specific to the the first executable is usually found at the same place within the exe all kind of difficult to explain all at but the resources provided should help cure at least some of your

is happening because the plugin binds the event handlers on page and you are then adding dynamic content to the page after the the easiest solution would be to move whatever code you have to instatiate the domwindow plugin into a function and call it once on page load and again whenever a new link is if it starts double binding the already existing then have to give the dynamic links a different class and instatiate the second time around for that seems to be some misunderstanding so explain jquery feature you are using for was designed to fix the problem that you are you probably already know this and hence you are using the above paragraph was because i believe what you are saying is that the domwindow link you are returning is not opening the domwindow as you might this is because domwindow does not use internally to bind the so when you initially instatiate domwindow on page the links get but the new ones if willing to edit the source code of the plugin you could directly fix this by simply using but it is easier not as to just move the code to a function and call it whenever adding more content to the

is so much misinformation in the answers in this thread that i know where to i just spent 4 points in reputation voting down the answers with misleading and wrong information in jet database engine is all involved as the op clarified with an is by default it was built from the ground up to be that a jet data store is reliable when the network is not this means not a wan and not because the bandwidth has to be sufficient for jet to maintain the ldb file which means a ping by your local instance of the jet database engine once per second default and because jet recover from a dropped connection is quite common in a wireless situation where access falls down is when a access application mdb is shared is not the case for this the reason it fails is because sharing things that be reliably shared and have no reason to be because of the way access objects are stored in an mdb file entire access project is stored in a single blob field in one record in one of the system very prone to corruption if multiple users open in my sharing an access front end an unsplit mdb with the tables and all in one is the source for of corruptions of basic answer to the question is jet would be a great data store for an app of that if any possibility at all for the user population to grow above then it might be better to start off from scratch with a database engine that is more robust at higher user

just written a simple web service that displays a web form containing a single type upload field and a single submit i made this simple web page with the intent that a human could use it and also that a script on a different machine could also execute it i got the human part all done and tested and now i just realized that i have no idea how to construct a url on the second machine that successfully executes this cgi script on the first machine gets a file uploaded from the second machine to the first do have some experience constructing urls that contain form but have never used the type upload input field so struggling with it a maybe using it my simple web service is a script called and if the file upload field is called and if the file on the second machine that i want to upload programatically is located in then i be able to just construct a url in a script on the second machine of the form and that file gets uploaded programatically just as if a human had clicked on the browse button on the web form manually and chose that file and clicked on the submit works fine manually when i bring up the cgi script form on the first machine and browse to the file and click the file seems to get uploaded by the web browser just but when i type in the above url into my browser to test out the file upload url manually before i program that url into a script on another the file that gets uploaded is a zero length it creates a file but completely same results if i use a known bad filename like what am i doing trying to accomplish this task on a couple of windows xp pcs with apache and activeperl and the form method is to programatically execute a cgi script form that contains a type upload input

keep getting a base64 invalid character error even though i program takes an xml file and exports it to a if the user it will compress the file as the compression works fine and returns a base64 string which is encoded into and written to a its time to reload the document into the program i have to check whether its compressed or the code is gzbuffer checks the beginning of the string to see if it has gzips code in the thing all my tests i take a compress decompress and compare it to the the problem is when i get the string returned from an ado the string is exactly what was written to the file the addition of a at the but i think that even does even trimmed off it still i even copy and pasted the entire string into a test method and works tests will pass but the code will fail using the exact same the only difference is instead of just declaring a regular string and passing it in getting one returned from a ideas on what am i doing string throwing invalid character

keeping track of what were the offsets marking the beginning of your segments and each segment length you want to compute that upon which would involve sort the offset list and calculate the distance between two of you will want to check the header of the http response sent by the server to make sure it supports the usage of the range the best way to specify the range is and the range you request includes both and byte thus consisting of micro chunks is something advise against as you might be blacklisted by a firewall rule to block http in suggest you make chunks smaller than 1mb and make more than 10 on what control you plan to have on your if got control you can consider writing only once every 32k at or writing data comment on the mmf but if the downloaded file is large not going to be a good idea as eat up a lot of ram and eventually even cause the system to which is handling the you could just create several files one per optionally preallocate the disk space filling up the file with as many as the size of the chunk might save you sometime while you write during the but will make starting the download and then finally just write all of the chunks sequentially into the final thing you should beware of is that several servers have a concurrent connections and you get to know it in so you should be prepared to handle http and to change the size of the chunks or to create a queue of the chunks in case you created more chunks than	
key pair is not used to encrypt the whole instead it is used to the a to sign a file such as an assembly you take a hash of the file and then ecrypt that hash with your private someone using the file verifies your signature by making a hash of the file themselves and then decrypting your encrypted hash using your public key and confirming these two hashes are the this proves two assembly is from who is claims to be from you as it has been produced with your private assembly been altered by someone else as the hash you made when you released the assembly is the same as the current can alter the signed assembly since they would also have to make corresponding changes to the encrypted hash which requires your private is a lot more detail about digital signatures in wikipedia great thing about key pairs is that they work either way so something encrypted with your private key can be only decrypted with your public key but also something encrypted with your public key can be decrypted with your private this latter use means that if someone wants to send something to you and only you then then can encrypt it with your freely available public key but they know only you with your private key can decrypt the keys only work as a pair making the someone else simply reverse the encryption done with the public key to get the message to

looking for the best way to store a set of as well as comments on those posts in imagine a design similar to a on facebook where users can write posts on their wall and other users can comment on those i need to be able to display all wall posts as well as the i first started i came up with a table such table id uuid not posted timestamp not userid uuid not posterid uuid not parentid uuid not comment text not is parentid will be null on original posts and point to an id if the row is a comment on an existing easy enough and super fast to insert new doing a select which would return of which order the rows existed in the database proved to be extremely i obviously just order by as someone might comment on post 1 after post 2 has been if i do a left join to get the parent post on all and then sort by that date all the original posts group together as have a value of i got this table id uuid not threadposted posted comment an original threadposted and posted would be the on a timestamp would be the time the original post was posted and would be the time the comment on that thread was now i can just from wallposts order by works however one thing irks if two people create a post at the same comments on the two posts would get munged together as have the same i could use instead of a but still the accuracy is only of a i could also setup a unique constraint on threadposted and posted which makes inserts a bit more but if i had multiple database servers in a the chance of a collision is still i almost went ahead with this anyway since the chances of this happening are extremely but i wanted to see if i could eat my cake and still have it mostly for my own educational solution would be to store this data in the form of a each node would have a and i could order by which would traverse the tree in the order i every time someone inserts a comment have to re balance the whole this would create a ton of row and all sorts of problems if the site was very kinda extreme and also causes replication so i tossed this idea also thought about just storing the original posts and then serializing the comments in a binary since who cares about individual this would be very however if a user wants to delete their comment or append a new comment to the i have to deserialize this modify the then serialize it back and update the if a bunch of people are commenting on the same post at the same i might have random issues with what i eventually i query for all the posts ordered by date in the middle ware i loop through the recordset and create a of original each node on the stack points to a linked list of when i come across an original i push a new node on the stack and when i come across a comment i add a node to the linked i organize this in memory so i can traverse the recordset once and have after i create the representation of the i traverse through this data structure again and write out this works great and has super fast inserts and super fast and no weird row locking however a bit heavier on my presentation layer and requires me to build an in memory representation of the wall to move stuff around so in the right i believe this is the best approach found so thought check with other sql experts to see if a better way to do this using some weird joins or unions or something which would still be performant with millions of is the best way to store a threaded message in

looking to create a application using a using wcf as a possible communications will host the in a windows service with wcf using i suppose i could define every service operation into a single service but there could be quite a few operations and rather divide them into several cohesive service splitting my operations into a set of service contracts mean that i would have to host each service on a separate be ideal as prefer to run it on one design tips regarding this thanks for any confusion it my intention to host each service operation in a different only to group them my problem stems from the fact that i thought that it possible to host multiple servicehosts on one says that it is possible to simply host multiple service hosts on one i think i must have misunderstood an exception message when i was trying this out if i can get this to work then i think it will be my favoured think that and approach of implementing each interface on a single concrete object and hosting it in a single servicehost is also a good pragmatic solution to my especially if you treat that single concrete object as a sort of one downside i can think of is that you be able to have different servicebehaviors depending on the i do agree with logic of when appropriate to implement multiple service contracts on one concrete

loop will not work for this you cannot use a loop to initialize an your array new i i translate to something like the array new j j int i i this were an array of it would still assigns each entry in the collection or in to the variable you which you can then work the variable is equivalent to an array it is just a cannot be used to initialize array or because it loops over the current contents of the array or giving you each one at a the variable in a is a proxy for an array or collection the compiler does not replace your with you have an array of for and try the array new d d new be translated to something like array new i i date d d new as you can see will not initialize the you will end up with an array containing all i took the code compiled it into a and then used to decompile this process gives me the following generated by the sun java compiler from the code new k j j int i i	
main constructor of which you talking about the static method that has a default location in the use that method to do initialization that needs to occur before you open any windows on if you need to use a loading you will probably want to move some code somewhere as you need a message loop around and the message loop will block until your form you return from the main method before you open any then no form will be shown said all i feel your question is a bit vague and pretty sure i understand exactly what it is that and is not a just a static

many product types do you do they each have their own application can do a generalized model called the attribute but it has a lot of pitfalls when trying to deal with specific properties of a simple search queries turn into real nightmares at the basic idea is that you have a table that holds the product property name id into a properties and the you can also add in tables to hold templates for each product so one set of tables would tell you for any given product what properties it can have along with valid value and another set of tables would tell you for any individual product what the values would caution strongly against using this model since it seems like a really slick idea until you have to actually implement you number of product types is reasonably go with your second solution one main product table with base attributes and then additional tables for each specific type of

my based on my gut instincts and various anecdotal i think that is the key aspect you rewrite something from you will do it based on the experienced you gained doing it the first you rewrite something from you will fail for innumerable am not sure where the knee of the curve is for the transition from small to big success to guesses are that when multiple developers are on when multiple interacting components are or when the people who are doing the rework are not the same as the people doing the original or when the original product is old enough that it does not have the same of tests as newer then all these things contribute and also all these things are correlated to thus the only way to something is to do it one small component at a

need to generate a wcf proxy for a service exposed by our the service is locked down pretty so this is proving new to so i may be missing something client has only opened up their firewall to our production server so i generate the proxy from visual studio on my dev the service is only exposed over and it requires us to authenticate using a client was hoping to run svcutil on the production box to generate the and then copy the files but svcutil refuses to run because the client is using a it gives me the following underlying connection was could not establish trust for the secure remote certificate is according to the validation tried adding the certificate as a trusted root but that in the certificates mmc i get does not have enough information to verify the there some way to bypass the security check that svcutil is can browse to the wsdl successfully from when remoted in to the production i just have to click to this website i also have to select the installed client which works i can then download the wsdl and xsd files manually through so another alternative might be to generate the wcf proxy from local copies of the wsdl and instead of running svcutil against the live but i know how to do that tried putting the static wsdl and xsd files up on another website that we and changing the attributes to point to the new but when i ran svcutil against this i got a bunch of errors about duplicate type declarations there was a validation error a schema generated during 1 1415 validation the already been i missing some obvious way to do or should we just demand that the client loosen up their for any help you can give wcf proxy against untrusted ssl

of them can be complicated and complex in their own can do in the grand scheme of it might not matter which you what does matter is how well you do what you are most experienced if your leading a do what the team is most experienced have done a lot of threaded and i enjoy parts of and parts of it i do not learned a and now can usually write a application without too much but it does have to be written in a very specific it has to be written with very clearly defined data boundaries that are thread whatever condition that can will and it might not be when you have a debugger laying plus debugging threaded code is like peering into by looking in other threads may or may not have had time to process it has to be written with test code that stresses the many systems only show their bugs when the machines are heavily there has to be some very smart person who owns the data exchanging if there is any way for a shortcut to be some developer will probably make and you will have an errant there has to be situations that will reset the application with a minimum of this is for the production code that breaks because of some threading in the show must go have less experience with but have recently been doing some stuff in windows the ipc is web service and it is relatively clean and but i follow some rules here as by and interprocess communication will be much more error free because programs receive input from the outside world very and those transport mechanisms are usually define clear process boundaries and communication oh tcp or web services or pipes or whatever is as long as the borders are and there is a lot of validation and error checking code at those be prepared for code forgiveness is very by this i sometimes you be able to write to that you have to be able to requeue and retry those messages without the application locking an there will be a lot more code in because transporting data across process boundaries means you have to serialize it in some this can be a source of especially when you start maintaining and changing that this

on to what veefu templates in are not like generics topic is tagged as so i assume you are comparing them in the actual code is not generated at but only at so that if you have a class with a template in you either must have it in a header or you must instantiate exactly which instances of it or else get a linker error because it find what looking because it was never actually when doing the compiler actually makes as many of your template class as you have instantiated different of the so from the if you have and the compiler actually outputs the code for 3 different this is why templated classes are defined in header files and not in compiled because the compiler needs to generate what is in contrast to generics in java where references are and you can only use what you have specified the generic to be inherited or from you need to declare that something implements icomparable to use any of the methods from or whatever other restrictions you put on when you use a a to ensure type but actually the is in that if you have a class with a templated then depending on the size of that the resultant class will be bigger or which affects the actual size of the hope that made some though it was a bit i actually know you could do templated functions as mch

on what it sounds like attempting a type of where a class is responsible for dynamically generating objects based upon information given from an external would recommend looking into design patterns for flex and i written a factory method in flex but it be much harder than which too what i would expect your program to look xml describes the object which will be generated your example appears to show have an xsd which can verify the xml file conforms to your expectations if it an appropriate error would be i would recommend something along these lines for you need to have a mechanism which guarantees the xml is abstracted the values you are expecting to be in the i would recommend using enums or string values in a separate utility have a factory class whose sole responsibility is to take in the xml generate the objects based upon the and return it to whoever needs 4th is what you are looking or example shows what this factory method might look i recommend you also abstract out the string values into a variable or if return new first is confusing to it sounds like trying to create a dynamic object with a to it where is defined as data in the i know if this is even i would certainly think it not

one line response would be that you lose one of the main benefits of this reduces the time to develop new code love to develop new so that should help your argument when adding a new type to an existing you have to add aside from figuring out which instance to in you are doing something wrong that the new class should simply be a drop in replacement for the appropriate way to handle this in java is to keep the code polymorphic and make use of so anytime they find themselves wanting to add another variable or do an instanceof they should probably be implementing an interface you can convince them to change the code it is pretty easy to retrofit interfaces into the existing code for that take the time to take a piece of code with instanceof and refactor it to be it is much easier for people to see the point if they can see the before and after versions and compare	
one major detail that affects your would like to implement the pattern for other projects that int ids are generated in the database to enforce now that you have you have to rely on the database to generate the value guids are guaranteed to be follow a pattern for the wrong reasons go ahead and create guid values in the constructor just be sure to have a setter so that nhibernate can overwrite the value when it fetches an entity from the you might want to consider using if your dba is concerned guids and database

only way to really do this is how the does is by setting an interval that keeps checking the current and comparing it against what it was we do this and let subscribers subscribe to a changed event that we fire if the hash its not perfect but browsers really support this event to keep this answer you are using jquery today should be somewhat foundational for then a nice solution is to use the abstraction that jquery gives you by using its events system to listen to hashchange events on the window work nice thing here is you can write code that need to even worry about hashchange however you do need to do some in form of a somewhat lesser known jquery feature special this feature you essentially get to run some setup code for any the first time somebody attempts to use the event in any way as binding to the this setup code you can check for native browser support and if the browser natively implement you can setup a single timer to poll for and trigger the jquery completely unbinds your code from needing to understand this support the implementation of a special event of this kind is trivial get a simple working but why do that somebody else has

organization has been experimenting with the introduction of more been trying the scrum approach for a short and most of the team more or adapted to i like it as a but concerned about one potentially severe impact of the as teams are consistently focused on features and backlog and testers are more integrated with the overall development it seems like skill sets are becoming and people are sensing less respect for their individual of our developers are excellent at technologies and optimization of data others have invested a large amount of their careers learning gui technologies and have developed a fundamental understanding of users and usability in an neither skill set is better than the but they are certainly this an inevitable result of the scrum since everyone on the team i understand contributes to satisfying the next backlog or testing goal at the underlying philosophy seems to be can do this in my simply not most engineers have a particular skill set they have honed over the and the scrum in my tends to devalue those very abilities they were previously respected an example for a sudden change of technology occurs on the data and every item on the list for the sprint is based on this new the gui developers likely had time to become acclimated with the new might not be able to contribute to the at the very they will need to invest time to get ramped and then their code will be suspect because of their lack of understand the need for rapid development to discourage but this discount one fundamental people develop in accordance to their or their people seem to be less motivated when they perceive their position is one of we can anyone in to do this particular how does scrum address if it has anyone addressed this when adopting the scrum the scrum process ultimately divest team members from their respective

orm framework will even get close to hand written sql in terms of although 100 queries seem unrealistic maybe you are exaggerating a even if you have the creator of the orm framework writing the it will always be far from the speed of good old advice look at the whole picture not only the framework improves code your team comfortable with writing sql and mixing it with you really understand how to optimize the framework think a for each object is not the optimal way of retrieving the queries of the framework present a never developed anything with but i think that you could mix both approaches and plain maybe after a of the app you can determine the real bottlenecks and replace that orm code for hand written sql in ruby you use then you profile the application with something as new relic and finally if you have a complicated ar query you replace that for some

others are very right to mention that you are almost certainly falling into the pit of premature when they say that trigonometric functions are not telling the whole trigonometric function implementations are actually in the value of the input this is because the trig functions are most efficiently calculated on a small interval like for the best even smaller parts of this but that one suffices to explain so the algorithm looks something like in series approximation of some or or perhaps a function requires 0 x if x x while x x return microcoded cpu instructions like the end up doing something like this so trig because they are usually take time to do the argument there are two you have to calculate a ton of values off the principal domain of the trig your math is probably not very well thought notation hides a constant argument reduction has a very small constant because simple to thus the part is going to dominate the part for just about every

poster is you cannot return multiple values from a you do have a couple of a structure that contains multiple an instance of a output parameters the or a dictionary or pair as pros and cons here are often hard to figure if you return a make sure small because structs are value type and passed on the if you return an instance of a there are some design patterns here that you might want to use to avoid causing problems members of classes can be modified because passes objects by reference have byval like you did in you can use output parameters but i would limit the use of this to scenarios when you only have a couple 3 or of parameters otherwise things get ugly and hard to the use of output parameters can be an inhibitor to agility because your method signature will have to change every time you need to add something to the return value whereas returning a struct or class instance you can add members without modifying the method an architectural standpoint i would recommend against using pairs or i find this style of coding requires in code that consumes the it must know ahead of time what the keys are going to be and what the values mean and if the developer working on the internal implementation changes the way the dictionary or kvp is it could easily create a failure cascade throughout the entire

professional apps are in your you would probably layer it like the two distinct depending on how complex the app the service other layers to support client the database store would be something like some tables in an oracle or microsoft sql and would on your layer would be your code that retrieves and stores data your it might also contain business which are basically classes that have properties representing your data from your the benefit of the data access layer is that sometimes reading and writing to a database can require specialized and you want that code sprinkled throuought your so instead you can call functions in your data access layer that loads needed data into so the rest of your application is just interacting with a regular old these are called which stands for something like plan old clr there are lots of variations on this of as people have taken different approaches to the problem of isaloting database also it serves the purpose of minimizing breaking changes whenever the database since the database access logic is not sprinkled throughout the then there are fewer places that need to be updated if the database changes as adding new columns to a table or changing a the business layer will be own and would contain most of the of the it would sit between the data access and web service using concepts from service oriented architecture you might have an authentication and a web request handling these services are a lot like a class that is always there waiting to process your web request handling service would take a and maybe first call into the authentication service to verify credentials before honoring the soa is one of those things i think should be used only when it some cases just using object oriented techniques will give you the same not always when done is more so it really depends on whether soa offers you additional benefits that you webservice would be responsible for receiving requests from the and acting on those requests by making calls into your business layer to update or retrieve the concept here would be that you could have many users of your service who publish their song updates through your client would have a service layer which would be responible for formatting requests into sending them to the web and retrieving messages from the web you would put very little application in your web service all this is probably overkill and inefficient for what you are wanting to do since you just want something for but the basic anatomy of a lot of webservice applications and would be a good learning the whole purpose of the layers is decoupling and while more makes the application overall more it means each component is this means easier to wrap your head around problems when you are only dealing with one component which interacts with only a couple other sourounding so there is a careful balance between few components and many too few and they become monolithic and difficult to too and they become intertwined in complex i have heard it said something along the lines of a class is getting too big and too then split it up into a few more in start subdividing stuff for the heck of it just because it sounds like the right thing to evaluate how complex your component is going to be before deciding if you want to split it sometimes for simple cases your have a layer serving more than one for the sake of getting it done faster and making the overall design the point apply these concepts where you will learn what is appropriate with and you obviously understand that you can learn the most by vbscript call a com you can compile dlls with com many older things can call com vbscript got script and that safe to your webservice will be where you would be most concerned with safe only if you design with security in mind and screw we all screw up sometimes which means there is no guarantee of it being perfectly

public except for classes that are essentially just not a good practice to get defined the class you might never be able to change it than adding to because people will build on it and rely on making a variable public means that you need to have that and you need to make sure it has what the user if you use a promising to supply some which is currently kept in that if the situation and rather not maintain that variable all the you can change the if the requirements change seen some pretty odd requirements and you mostly need the name in this variable but sometimes the one in that you can just change the if you made the variable be stuck with always but i find it a lot easier just to write a quick getter than to analyze the situation to see if regret making the variable public risk being wrong member variables private is a good habit to get any shop that has code standards is probably going to forbid making the occasional member variable and any shop with code reviews is likely to criticize you for it really matter for ease of get into the safer

quantities are and typically we know their numeric properties with a lot less precision than a typical in almost all the c types float and double are good is necessary to know some of the for testing two numbers for equality is usually not what you since all it takes is a single bit of inaccuracy to make the comparison tgamblin has provided some good usual exception is which is calculated exactly according to certain conventions that translate well to binary part of this is the constants never see a interest or a interest but you might well see a interest in other the numbers used are typically expressed in exact decimal not all of which are exact binary the rounding in calculations is governed by conventions that also translate well into this makes it extremely difficult to precisely duplicate financial calculations with standard floating and therefore people use other methods for

question seems to be it worth learning wsgi and doing everything or using a stack framework that does everything for say a false dichotomy and an obvious third turbogears 2 tries to provide a smooth path from a everything for style framework up to an understanding of wsgi and an ability to customize almost every aspect of the framework to suit your may not be successful in every place at every but particularly if already got some turbogears 1 experience i think the tg2 learning curve will be very easy at first and have the ability to go deeper exactly when you need address your particular provide an authorization system out of the box that matches the one used to from provide an out of the box like interface called the which works great with dojo to make a fancy spreadsheet like interface the also like to address a couple of the other options that are out there and talk a little bit about the i think cherrypy is a great webserver and a nice minimalistic not based on wsgi internally but has good wsgi support although it will not provide you with the but for custom setups that need to be both fast and particularly suited to the defaults provided by django or a great i think django is a very tigtly integrated system for developing if your application and style of working fits well within standard setup it can be if however you need to tune your db replace the template use a different user authorization model or otherwise do things differently you may very likely find yourself fighting the pylons like cherrypy is a great minimalistic unlike cherrypy wsgi enabled through the whole system and provides some sane defaults like sqlalchemy and mako that can help you scale the new official docs are of much better quality than the old wiki docs which are what you seem to have looked	
question that the answers given so far seem to if the runtime libraries the can keep track of the number of things in the then why do we need the syntax at why a single form be used to handle all answer to this goes back to roots as a language it no longer really strives to philosophy was that the programmer should not have to pay for any features that they if not using then they should not have to carry the cost of object arrays for every allocated chunk of if your code simply foo new the memory space allocated for include any extra overhead that would be needed to support arrays of only array allocations are set up to carry the extra array size you then need to tell the runtime libraries to look for that information when you delete the why we need to of bar is a pointer to an most of us that fussiness about a few extra bytes of memory seems quaint these but there are still some situations where saving a few bytes what could be a very high number of memory can be

real code you are referring to is usually called a good unit testing your unit tests should be in their own classes probably their own so that be an rest is language based for the most the more advanced a the better ability to avoid writing support code to some a development system can help you avoid writing a lot of code screen ruby on but these abstractions can break down and cause you to write just as much code as anything else if you use it to develop targets outside intended types of ruby help all that much if calculating prime the you have art of eliminating all the supporting code that you can well as redundancies in your business to keep your clean and practicing advanced probably end up writing tools for abstracting data out of your code and into a structured file of some sort can eliminate huge piles of support code and move the rest into because now parsing that data and setting it up is part of the your program is a good because this type of business logic tends to be more readable and easier to the other advantage of this kind of abstraction is that all your is now done in data which tends to make it somebody an example of this type of rails it takes a lot of the boilerplate of web development and factors it out of the code and into libraries driven by data and simplistic code blurs the line between code and data files actually loop back to being specified in ruby

really depends on the goal of your course teaching programming and teaching computer science are two separate and though they are not mutually introductory classes generally do not teach both equally an example of the say we want to learn how to sort a a programming course in would teach you to use the syntax of a function and homework might be writing several comparison a computer science course would explain to you what a merge sort what the algorithm looks like in and its and homework would be writing the sort function if you are teaching introductory then you should teach your students about you are teaching computer then there is no need to understand pointers at an introductory

really does the lib expose only functions where memory is either managed by straight win32 methods or the caller never frees memory allocated by the callee or do you only rely on basic libraries that changed much since vs if you should be are 2 basic things to watch changes to global variables used by and changes to the structure of etc defined by those for the crt memory allocator has probably changed its hidden allocation management structures between the 2 so having one version of the library allocate a piece of memory and having another free it will probably cause a another if you expose classes through the interface and they rely on ms runtime libraries like a chance that the class layout has changed between vs 6 and vs that means that accessing a on the class could go to the wrong thing and cause unpredictable probably hosed if the uses mfc in any mfc defines and internally uses tons of and any access to mfc globals by the operations in the could cause failures if the mfc infrastructure has changed in the hosting environment has changed a lot since vs explored exactly what changes were made in the mfc but seen unpredictable behavior between class binaries compiled in different vs top of those a risk for functions like that rely on static global variables defined in the not but concerned those static variables may not get initialized properly if you use a client expecting the crt on a thread created on the look at the documentation for for more

reason for this is because is defined as a value on and a value on when the 4th argument is passed into the variadic the upper bits appear to be the 4th and 5th values that are pulled out are can solve this problem with a simple cast on all the such does not answer all my such is it the 4th likely because the first 3 are in does one avoid this situation in a portable this happen on other using values that might be on some i pull out the values as values regardless of the target and will that cause problems if a value is pushed into the variadic do the standards say about this really wanted to get a quote from but something not and costs money to and therefore i believe quoting it would be a copyright the made clear that when writing a function that takes a number of nothing you can do for type up to the caller to sure that each argument either perfectly matches or is explicitly there are no implicit much should be obvious to those who understand c and that gcc has a feature to format but not so obvious is that not only are the types not implicitly but if the size of the types match you can have uninitialized or undefined behavior in the where an argument is placed might not be initialized to and there might not be a some platforms you could pass a and extract two values inside the variadic undefined

say what kind of data it is much depends on your and this data is very large many instances of the objects in a database can help performance via its indexing otherwise it probably hurts or is your app is being run by multiple users and they may want to write this a database helps because you can rely on transactions to ensure data with persistence you have to handle that if the data is or a database is very likely your app has its own using a database places an additional burden on the who must set up and maintain patches the database if the database can be guaranteed to be available and is handled by someone this is less of an are the security requirements for the if the data is with multiple users simultaneous or you may need to manage security and permissions on the without seeing the data hard to say whether it would be easier to manage with persistence or a the data is many of the above questions about the data have answers pointing toward if you need centralized the answers generally point toward a guess is that you probably need a based solely on the fact that asking about it mainly from a perspective and not a especially in is highly customizable and can be easily tailored to persist only the essential pieces you there are best for versioning this data as so not sure an advantage on the database side from that if you do not know that functionality will be required in the do not build for it almost certainly easier overall to solve that problem when the time comes than to constrain your development more often than sharing data between parts of the that should be architected into the application into the classes that access the overload the persistence mechanism to also be a data conduit between parts of the if you overload it that turning the persisted state into a contract instead of properly treating it as an extension of the private state of the

see what entity objects have to do with probably talking about using orm in this case i agree with very interested in entity objects are never in your way of building a highly scalable application but you have to do it the right in other words you need a as opposed to a dal generated using some actually this is why i like nothing that beats a i also use linq as i read in many places that it has a big i tweak every query in my apps and create the needed i let some orm generate the code for agree with you that entity objects make the code harder to actually the whole purpose of this architecture is to make it to easier to maintain and modify your code and this is what i see in i wrote spaghetti code for a long time use or so i know what talking entity objects are needed for i wonder how you cache the data in your applications if you use entity do you use datasets or

seem to grok the different solutions found and tracking external let alone understand how to apply them use you guys be so kind to shed some light on this and help me specific use what would be the best solution for concrete not gonna attempt to generalize since i might make wrong assumptions about so new with all building a website in django web framework in are a lot of 3rd party plugins available for use with calls them that you can drop in your some apps might require a bit of modification to get working like but if you start making modifications to 3rd party code the problem of updating that code when newer versions at the same time keeping your local the way i would do that in subversion is by using vendor repository layout would look like this case would have been svn of one tags in say that it was i now want to upgrade my version in trunk to as you i have already updated and it i can update by svn the on this my local people unknown with this it is described in i want to do this whole process in how can i do me the must be able to place the external code in an arbitrary position in the must be able to modify the external code and keep in my git must be able to easily update the external should a be whilst keeping my bonus points i want to do this without something like it should be possible to track the apps and their from their repository 3rd party django apps are kept giving me the added benefit of being able to commit messages between and fixing more easily since i can deal with a lot of small of the one artificial commit created by think one would do this with in but i worked with that solution where a combination of both methods could be used would more since there might be app developers who source control or make their repos available both behavior and tracking straight from reposity another think i would either have to use or a combination of but smack down me if i know which or how do to it eagerly awaiting your please be as verbose as since i already had a hard time understanding found in 3rd party code with	
seems like a rather difficult thing to because you really isolate a single process to run by in if you tried to do so run into difficulty defining what constitutes a is it just the userspace code that belongs to that or do you include the kernel code executed on behalf of the program as what if the os optimizes kernel code so that similar requests from different programs are handled using a nearly constant amount of then you even separate out the energy usage by a case like my inclination would be to measure the expectation essentially the average amount of energy used by the ideally start with a large number of all identical except that half of them have the application running and half of them let each of the systems run under whatever operating conditions you want to test under conditions for all of except for the fact that half of them are running the app and half are and either measure the rate of energy consumption using the standard or let the batteries run out and measure how long it takes each unit to drain its then compare the average result from the devices that were running the app the average result from those that and you can figure out how much the program increases the power consumption of the

simple rule is if you are going to query the then it should be a discrete field within a table within the if you can store the blob and be done with if you want to derive from a and index then you can do that readily as your data types are congruent with what the database can support can be accurately there can be some value is exploding the blob in to its component parts that map nicely in to db problem with defining on the could be easily is not so much the definition of the but the potential change of the tables that are being changed a column or tend to be unusable for the duration of the not an issue for 100 a real problem for millions of the data definitions are fairly then creating a mapping facility that lets your users describe the and then you use that definition to both create a compliant table and convert the blobs appropriately during for the rows of different you can still stuff that data in to a single some rows have columns compared to each row is identified by if you have lots of row and lots of you get lots of wasted space doing then you may want to go to having a table for each row and a master table that holds the row types and references to the real rows in the actual you would only need this master table if you care about the relationships of the original data packets to each other you can store them in receipt it all boils down to how much data you how much you how much work you want to do vs how much you already have

simplest approach that i can think is to add some logic into your data access layer that will inject a domain object with its dependencies before returning it to a higher layer called the service you could annotate each properties to indicate what needs to get wired if not on java you could implement an interface for each component that needs to be or even declare this all in xml and feed that data to the context that will do the if you wanted to get you could pull this out into an aspect and apply it globally across your data access layer so all methods that pull out domain objects will wire up them up just after they are

solution you propose seems like a good as long as you mind people being able to view the part of the site if they are logged ie as long as the http part of the site does not contain any sensitive and the only difference between logged in and users is something harmless in the reason it is not used very often may be one scenario may just not be very usually if you care enough to make part of your site restrict the login session just to that secure or make the entire site always use https solutions exist which are secure and which are capable of more than for example logging in someone at an https login form and maintaining that session while transferring them back to an also think flickr or their sign in page is always but once the started you migrate back to http while maintaining the session since i wrote this back in 2009 the practice of having a secure connection for the login screen but dropping back to http once logged in seems to have possibly because the overhead of using https is not seen as so much of a big now more than sites are increasingly using https as the whenever they accept user

sqlite is it relies on fsync to ensure a particular set of statements have completed when a transaction is the speed and implementation of fsync varies from platform to by batching several statements within a you can get a significant increase in speed since several blocks of data will be written before fsync is older sqlite article illustrates this difference between doing several inserts inside and outside if you are writing an application needing concurrent access to note that when sqlite starts a write all reads will be you may want to explore using your in memory cache to retrieve data while a write transaction is taking that also possible that caching scheme will handle that for

summary lists both c and which of them are you looking c and are two distinct and differ greatly in their string handling and data structures the fact that the c ones work in change do you want a perfect hash is it that you want to associate a string with a and thought that would be a good way to do is this some sort of homework do you have a reason not to use in if you do need a perfect what are the constraints on the will there be a certain fixed set you want to dispatch what about strings that match one of the are you willing to accept hits from random or is the number of incoming strings you could edit your question to include information like we could be a lot more response to the first two we should look at c since you presumably want this for both your c and you presumably want the but have you if dealing with strings coming in on the the time there is likely to dwarf the dispatch are expecting arbitrary a bit much to expect a perfect hash function that will avoid all collisions from random so you do need to consider you considered a it may be more efficient than a perfect hash function may not it should be fairly easy to implement in and it will avoid problems with redoing your list of dispatching strings or possible

the answer to has most of the information you need to put together your might also want to see the chapter on sorting in has a completely fine although i hate using like a more familiar way to do the same thing is to go through the keys of the hash but sort by the sort keys do it this way because a little less do i sort a hash by value instead of by brian d sort a start with the in this we give the list of keys to the sort function which then compares them asciibetically might be affected by your locale the output list has the keys in asciibetical once we have the we can go through them to create a report which lists the keys in asciibetical sort cmp keys my printf could get more fancy in the block instead of comparing the we can compute a value with them and use that value as the to make our report order we use the sequence in a string to make everything the block then compares the lowercased values to determine in which order to put the sort cmp keys if the computation is expensive or the hash has many you may want to look at the schwartzian transform to cache the computation we want to sort by the hash value we use the hash key to look it we still get out a list of but this time they are ordered by their sort keys there we can get more if the hash values are the we can provide a secondary sort on the hash sort cmp keys

the working on developing a new website to access an old this is a dod installation so lots of security current application is written in classic vbscript and some the new systems is the database in the old system meant hitting the server with your own credentials now trying to test some of the early development when i used cassini i had no trouble getting to the database because registered with the sql server instance as a trusted due to security aspects that i have to cassini serve as a test server anymore i have to use iis have security card readers cassini handle when i went through all the problems of getting the appropriate accounts added to administrators on my local pc so that i could debug in vs2008 while using i tried to connect to the database and i was rejected because was not a trusted the existing database is out of the hard coding usernames and passwords for access to the database is out of the asked the dba if he could add to of the domain groups so that sql server could see it as a trusted connection was in a group that was seen as a trusted he tells me that is not technically the end there are going to be three or four machines another the eventual live web server and a future test web aspnet accounts are going to be hitting our two sql servers and do i have to do to make the existing sql server see me as friend and not i looked at impersonation but i get the impression not compatible with our system the business rules make a call to a common routine to create a sqlconnection object and open it even a sqltransaction object to go with and this object is used for the rest of the business rules and layer until it look like impersonation would persist once the sqlconnection was opened byref back to the calling in advance for any to get aspnet to be recognized as a trusted connection by sql server

then have no reseatable type which can not be you included 3 types of which would just complicate the language for very little gain then why not add the 4th type reference which can be better question may why would you want references to be if they that would make them less useful in a lot of it would make it harder for the compiler to do alias seems that the main reason references in java or are reseatable is because they do the work of they point to they are not aliases for an should the effect of the following i j with it is j is an alias for and i ends up with the value references had been then the third line would bind the reference j to a different it would no longer alias but instead the integer literal 43 of or perhaps a simpler at least syntactically i k j reseatable j would point to k after evaluating this j still points to and i is assigned the value references reseatable changes the semantics of the the reference can no longer be an alias for another instead it becomes a separate type of with its own assignment and then one of the most common usages of references would be and nothing would be gained in the newly gained functionality for references already existed in the form of so now have two ways to do the same and no way to do what references in the current language

thing to keep in mind when working with nhibernate is that it deals with entities and only knows what told it the mapping hql is an version of sql so you use it to access fields that part of your mapped domain can still execute plain old sql through an nhibernate session which is really the only way to access data that you mapped into your there might be a lightweight mapping solution i say without seeing your data but if against mapping the i think sql is your best

thing you know about the inner prism is that it will have the same ratios as the outer in other words given the height of the inner prism you can calculate the inner base length and from there the know the base will have 1 unit so that leaves calculating the distance from the pinnacle of the inner prism to the pinnacle of the outer distance is the hypontenuse of a right angled the angles in the triangle are known since they are function of the base length and one side of the triangle is of length being the perpendicular from the inner edge at the inner pinnacle to the outer final side of the triangle is where that perpendicular intersects the outer edge up to the outer is enough info to use standard trig to caclulate the hypotenuse this length plus 1 thickness the subtracted from the original height gives you the inner the ratio between the inner and outer heights can be applied to the base a probably cleverer ways to do this but this would be my common bloke

this a covariance a static versus dynamic dispatch static dispatch means an overloaded method call is bound to the appropriate type at compile time based on the type of the passed base derived base void base a new prints derived b new prints dispatched based on declared base c new prints void void dispatch means the function is bound at runtime based on the actual type of the object stored in the public virtual void derived public override void void base a new prints derived b new prints dynamically dispatched based type of object stored in base c new prints void void last print shows the difference between the like most oop only supports dynamic dispatch for the implicit parameter to as in other words methods are dynamically but methods are typical solution to fake multiple dispatch in single dispatch languages is by using the which would work for you

threads might be running on different with different memory they might be running on the same with one interrupting the this has two you have no way of knowing whether one thread will be interrupted by another in the middle of doing so in your no way to be sure that thread1 try to read the string value before thread2 has written or even that when thread1 reads it is in a if it is not in a consistent then using it might do when you write to memory in one there is no telling if or when code running in another thread will see that the change might sit in the cache of the writer thread and not get flushed to main it might get flushed to main memory but not make it into the cache of the reader part of the change might make it and part of it without locks other synchronization mechanisms such as you have no way of saying whether something that happens in thread a will occur or something that happens in thread you also have no way of saying whether or when changes made in thread a will be in thread use of locking ensures that all changes are flushed through the so that code sees memory in the state you think it should it also allows you to control whether particular bits of code can run simultaneously interrupt each this looking at your code the minimum locking you need is to have a synchronisation primitive which is by the second thread after it has written the and on by the first thread before using that this would then guarantee that the first thread sees any changes made by the second assuming the second thread started until after firstfunctionrunfromthread1 has been if that might not be the then you need the same deal with thread1 writing and thread2 simplest way to actually do this is to have a mutex which your you decide what data and any code which reads or writes the data must be holding the mutex while it does so first you then read write the then this ensures consistent but on its own it does not ensure that thread2 will get a chance to do anything at all in between two different kind of mechanism will also include the necessary memory so if you send a message from the writer thread to the reader meaning finished you can read then that will be can be more efficient ways of doing certain if those prove too

versus artificial primary keys is one of those issues that gets widely debated and imho the discussion only seems to see the positions my opinion both work so long as the developer knows how to avoid the downside of a natural primary key composite or single more nearly ensures that duplicate rows are not added to the whereas with artificial primary keys it is necessary to first check the record is unique opposed to the primary which being artificial will always be one effective way to achieve this is to have a unique or candidate index on the fields that make the record unique the fields that make a candidate for a primary an artificial primary key makes for easy relations can be made with a single field to single field with a composite key the writer of the sql statement must know how many fields to include in the

want to make sure that simply reading the directory each time and generating the file names is a real bottleneck before do anything more certainly less but the code is arguably if it a then the controller action responsible for rendering the view is the right place for the note that need to turn of output caching for the action it if you want the image to change each it turns out that reading the file names and constructing the links really is a bottleneck it may take much less time than reading the actual file and the files in the directory can change while the application is then constructing a collection of them and storing them in the session on login is a reasonable way to handle the caveat is that if the application is also responsible for uploading the images that it knows when they you might be able to load them at application start and keep them in a global instance which is updated by the application as images are uploaded you have your collection of images reading each from the or a global use a random number generator to pick the image that you want to display or a set that you want to rotate through using something like the jquery cycle pass it to the view and have it render the image

way to look at the precise meaning of a const pointer is that you will not be able to make changes to the object that would be visible via that or any other pointer or reference to the same but when an object all other pointers to the address previously occupied by the object no longer pointers to that they store the same but that address is no longer the address of any object fact it may soon be reused as the address of a different distinction would be more obvious if pointers in behaved like weak as soon as the object is all extant pointers to it would immediately be set to the kind of thing considered to be too costly at runtime to impose on all and in fact it is impossible to make it entirely

would definitely stick with the immutable version if you really need the class at immutability makes it easier to reason about your code if you store a reference to a useful to know that not going to the performance is almost certain to be insignificant the io involved in reading the line is likely to be more significant than creating a new if concerned about should should the code before you decide to make a design decision based on those performance if your state is just a are you really providing much benefit over just storing the strings directly and having appropriate methods to analyse them does analyse the string and cache that or is it really just a bunch of parsing

would probably help you to understand the php data types and how affected when you do operations to variables of various you say you have variable in php say but what type is that probably a since an integer have that value just so when you do operator a string and an i know how to add a string and an but i do know how to convert a string into an and then add two ints so let me do and then it converts to because the php rules for converting a string to an integer say that any number of leading zeroes in the string are which means that the string becomes the i know how to add 1 and and the output of that statement is

would say answer is a pretty good have looked at rails and all three inhabit the same with flex producing flash rias and gwt and rails doing the same for worked with there is a lot to like but some serious niggling the main one for me being the difficulty integrating html into a flex app no trivial task and there are few projects that can avoid on the other hand is daunting initially because and does not come with the same kind of drag and drop editor that flex provides in flex gwt designer is a pretty good equivalent to flex builder in the gwt world and for a java programmer with swing the architecture of gwt take much figuring to mention the sheer number of java programmers around who can pitch gwt to their managers as a simple their existing java the google brand terms of sellability within the a java tool is always going to be an easier sell than actionscript or ruby on hard to say for sure where things are headed but i would expect to see continued growth for all everyone wants ria these

would say that the library should be independent of user this case the in that having a dependency on a config file is not so do want the connectionstring in the of your but you want to pass it to the library through a parameter at some this would allow you to use the same library in a non web also it would allow you to implement different ways to get the connectionstring a webservice	
would simply retrieve the object again on the other view but why not cache the object when it is first as dim members pseudo code a man return as dim members for each member in member data regarding the return should also consider caching the results of the query for a specified time or make it dependent on an you could also use the session object if it is user specific

xml document can only have a single root i suggest you have a root element with elements under note that you still be able to append new elements within the same file have to read the existing file and rewrite in theory you just overwrite the last line always know how long it will so you could just seek to the right but more robust to read the file into append a new and then write out the whole document also think a bit strange to have the element the subject suggest a structure like second email comes here

you ever been frustrated by visual studio not certain watch expressions when stepping through code with the have and does anyone here care about pure methods with no so many great things about that i but i write pure that static methods with no if you were to build your own compiler where you could write something like int somereftype int int return only is the above a free i call it a the function is assured to not have any the keyword could here be used to indicate just and provide a contract for pure these kind of functions can always be without causing side this being a way for visual studio to always evaulate my functions in the despite the faulty assumpation that all method calls and user operators have side a method where all the parameters are copy by value can never have side visual studio fails to recognize love for what you can do at and i miss these things in i think is dumbing down on the user a bit and basically not allowing certain hurting many things which actually relate what you can do at compile like to actually see more meta programs which are programs run by the compiler to compiler your original while has booleans and allow things like a obj as it generate the approriate i did some digging around and noticed how fails to generate approriate il for branchless for example y 1 an il instruction for just that which the compiler you or be instrested in an which looks like but is something entierly more and more and totally in terms what you can do with of methods in evaulation and custom

you want to process an xml document in its parsing xml into a dom will almost always be the least efficient in terms of deserialisation cpu usage and memory to a dom requires around times the amount of memory as the xml document requires disk for a 1 megabyte xml document will parse into a dom taking up megabytes of ever parse into a dom if you intend to modify some or all of the data and then put the result back into an xml for all other use dom is a poor is often significantly less resource but this does depend on the length of the document how many elements you and the location in the document of the data in which you are memory usage and completion time tends to increase the further down the document you for say you have an xml document with childnode each childnode has a unique identifier that you know in and you want to extract a known childnode from the extracting the childnode would use much more memory than extracting the if you are using xpath to extract all childnode you may find it less efficient than parsing into a xpath is generally an easy way of extracting a portion of an xml not recommend using it for processing all of an xml far the best if you are indeed looking to extract and process all data in an xml would be to use a this will be both orders of magnitude faster and less resource heavy than any other it does also depend on the volume of data you are dealing for the example xml document you you notice any practical dom will be and sax will be but talking or can easily be hundreds or thousands of times faster than however if the difference between 2 microseconds and 2 milliseconds not going to when dealing with a document containing childnode 2 seconds versus 200 seconds will become more of a	
you want to sort by the value of the integer stored as a you can simply do something like	
you were using to run the xslt and the maths capabilities of xpath are not good enough for your you can make calls from the xslt to methods in your class which would allow you to call out to to do your maths and then return the value back into your search for xslt	
you will not need to recompile for postgresql to take advantage of the additional will happen is that the linux scheduler will now be able to select two or more to postgresql to run all at the same basically they are working in parallel rather than having to wait on each other to get a slice of cpu this means you are able to process data faster since now four different queries can be processed at the same time rather than just the two you had has no further tuning required to take advantage of multiple and it is entirely up to the you basically improved your performance for the cost of a new you are looking for information on tuning your postgresql take a look at post on tuning postgresql on a dedicated you now have more processes able to run at the same you may also want to consider upgrading the amount of ram you have depending on what you currently have the more the database is able to be stored in memory the faster all of the transactions and queries will	
you work in a closed environment you dont develop a all classes are used within a same project framework there is no usual argument is that the future you may need to do some check on the so it is easier with i dont buy it at public fields is more less decoration and easier to	
you writing it you need to find out who is and take their experience into having them learn a new language just because you know what they are familiar with is not exactly a good way to would would work would personally pic it really just depends on the experience you have is this about the if there are 3rd party controls they want to use that might dictate the to work there are lots of free controls and examples in java and as well and extending the standard java controls might even work better that going with the 3rd party like you need to know more about the application and some other things that are out there before you can really be advising somebody else on what to	
you written this code yet in and if have you profiled i would argue that you probably need to worry about the objects being in contiguous memory the jvm is better at memory management than you are in a garbage collected really concerned about maybe java the right tool for the but my gut instinct is to tell you that worrying about optimization too and that a java version of your working with will probably suit your

your container l l return only have a single you are appending a list to another therefore you are adding a list to that may work in some but you are going to have a doubling of length have a single there is no need to specify an algorithm in or create a new list instance each time the method is avoid returning a reference you need to just would be more appropriate than is almost always the wrong hawtin	
your css so that both columns are both set to this will make your columns stack one after the may also have to reduce the widths you have given some browsers like internet explorer tend not to like having widths of and cause the furthest right floated item wrap on to the next only guessing that this is your problem could also try adding the the div this will push it below of how big point2	
your data most appropriate for your problem you have much data in a worst case assuming each row takes up 200 looking at less than 200 kb of a trivial amount even if your particular database implement boolean properties in an efficient the other having 150 boolean properties sounds somewhat perhaps your data model can be further	
your i would best implement being able to pass a function pointer down a list vector are stl vectors ok for lists like use an interface create a interface with a method that all of your classes can you made need more than one or an interface with a different name and method i would be right to implement windows and geometry features as related even the not certain exactly what your are but this may be a case for create a class which can be subclassed by your various geometry feature classes and window on the other hand your may be conflating your model and your view to best design a class that can have a collection of you want the collection to be of the superclass mentioned above whatever you choose for your or possibly even an this is done frequently in gui suggestions regarding attribute transferral between objects the desired behaviour is that modifying a feature will alter the attributes of that feature and any it and modifying a will only modify that functionality sounds like it should be a part of a renderer this class would traverse your linked list and call the above mentioned method on each it could also do things like cache attributes from the last ancestor with a given attribute this should allow the sort of attribute or feature overriding not directly it would likely be instructive for you to examine an existing oo gui and both have

your questions form a and not a there are two common ways to hierarchical data in list model requires repeated to look up children children of if you have an like the orm will take care of doing sufficient to bring back a question and its child without an orm to do have to either dynamically add to a or do multiple one for each row in the previous result set usually attributed to joe allows you to get a whole tree in a single but it means that adding and deleting nodes is more requiring updates to all adjacency you could have a question table like this question this departs from the classical adjacency in that instead of children holding the the parent holds two children or

your remote repository is no longer a bare and you pushing on the remote checkout to publish a git bare repository is one without a checked out working copy of the it only contains the git as a general rule you should never push into a repository that contains changes in the working to ensure this making the server repository a bare repository it has no working that the target of a is normally a repository with no work tree of its can also push to a repository that has a working but the working will not be updated by the may lead to unexpected results if the branch you push to is the currently a detached work tree is defined can for instance correspond to a web you need to a hook on your remote repository the one described running checkout and the warning config on your remote the value of config and config
