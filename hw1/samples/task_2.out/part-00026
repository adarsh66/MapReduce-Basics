2 other answers have the dpi settings may be giving you i have found that mixing with px sizing can be a real challenge once you consider dpi settings and different browser default now i just use px for font most of the problems go force that single user back to the regular i willing to bet that they are need reading glasses and the new high res monitor they got was harder to read because the print was so someone adjusted the dpi and now the fonts are the same size as the old so now they really do like the new monitor the problem now is some web pages are messed where you come thing you might want to look at when changing monitors from a crt to flat screen is the digital font smoothing fuzzy characters become this does not affect your web to address point raised by makes some excellent points in his context certainly answer was a bit lazy and the reason i use px is because of the inconsistency across to my way of specifying a point size should specify the physical size of the character to the user on the device he is but in practice it does suppose you most browsers under this defaults to the much maligned ie7 decided to use some other default and that font seems smaller and less readable in the same point the same can be said of arial verdana specify the same point and your whole layout throw in dpi settings on setup and it is setting is a bit of an your monitor or phone has a fixed you can only change it if you get a new monitor or having a dialog box to change the dpi is there only because the device does not report to the operating system what the dpi an imperfect i leave you with this suggestion use px for now to specify the font but only use it make all other sizes relative to your base when you have to port everything over to the latest blackberry or ipod that does a better job of switching from 11px to 11pt will be and test out your software so it does look nice as you boost the font

agree with pop it is probably best not to block in those command i think you could improve your game by thinking about the design a bit let me provide some thoughts for you on how you could possibly improve your it sounds like the problem you are describing is that you want to send a lot of move in a certain to a game component and have it execute those commands in that certain as you have there is a difference in the time it takes the computer to perform the calculations the velocity or and the time it takes the component to actually perform the action or problem with blocking during the calculations is that the update loop that is calling that function cannot update any other that may work okay if there is only one component to worry but not usually the case in most for the good how do we fix this i think erikkallen has the right but i would take it a bit it sounds like the game component is some kind of entity that will be moving so why not give it an action a simple implementation would be to just have your calling function call something queueaction function might look like void the top of your update function you could nocurrentaction need to add a line at the end of the update function nocurrentaction i definitely call this the best but it take much code to implement of course if you need to move and rotate at the same time have to tweak it a it will also get messier when you add different types of a more general i would think about making a base action and deriving specific action classes from then you could just push actions to the and your update function could call the update which would do the work the two sections of your game components update function is doing are just some ideas to think i hope something here will get you last thing i wanted to mention was that i see you using gametime variable that is passed to the amount your component moves and rotates may need to be a function of the elapsed time since update was last meaning that the update function would move and rotate your game component based on the amount of time that has not just how many times the update function was not very good at explaining and it depends on how like your game to here are a different from shawn hargreaves an xna forum discussing the point i was trying to

an experienced c programmer dipping my toes in oo design i have a particular piece of code i hate and would like to clean up using code implements a display tree for use in a 3d graphics it is a linked list of entries which have a type field specifying whether the entry is a geometry feature or light in particular geometry features can either be a single piece of geometry of a collection of sub which is indicated by the presence of a separate a linked list it is a flat structure but the order implies each entry has an attribute structure which is able to be propagated down the separate function allows this list to be traversed and a provided function pointer to be executed on traversal of the each function used in this way must take proper care to maintain the attribute structure as it is propagated down the list and this is a frequent cause of rendering bugs things not realising they should be redrawn because they are part of a group of for some aspects of oo design jump right out at me i am interested to i would best implement being able to pass a function pointer down a list vector are stl vectors ok for lists like i would be right to implement windows and geometry features as related even the classes to best design a class that can have a collection of suggestions regarding attribute transferral between objects the desired behaviour is that modifying a feature will alter the attributes of that feature and any it and modifying a will only modify that realize this is a long and broad so appreciate your thoughts on any of the above design propagating

and generics are really a different of the goals of generics is to be able to use them in a cross cross language which is not the same as they are a clr not a language concept they need language support templates can be seen in a on kind of way flame i know templates are not because you can see them a as a textual expansion which is then this gives them the ability to use whatever is defined on the template parameter operators for because constraints are imposed by the code using since generics are resolved at constraint have to be imposed at the definition level so that the compiler can ensure their usage will be valid means that you cannot use operators on generics parameters because you cannot indicate a constraint for the existence of an i the main point of generics is to be able to create generic dll to be used by other this is why they are	
and i are having an argument over the value and usage of tags in looking to the stackoverflow community to put in their thoughts to help us resolve the side claims that tags are a valuable addition to release an example of their we do a maven which makes a new tag it which is code snapshot used for this this tag should be a readonly when a bug needs to be fixed we can make a copy of the tag into a new branch it bug fixes go these fixes may be merged back into trunk so that the main dev branch gets the bug is released and a tag is automatically this cycle the main benefit here of the tag is that if you ever need to version for any you can just release the tag with the confidence that never been altered by saying tag is cleaner than saying revision 1 of branch which is the original without the other side claims that tags providing any valuable especially in a system like subversion with global which act like a tag in subversion only gives a warning when committing to a it actually stop their method is developing in trunk and upon release make a branch called continue bug fixes in trunk and if you needed to those bug fixes to merge them into branch and at some perhaps after major fixes or features in release and make branch cycle if you ever need to release the original have to check out branch revision both methods like to hear the thoughts on which method is preferred and a little worried that the way depends on the underlying scm either settle on subversion for answers or if possible keep it scm usage of tags in

answer here is that a web reference will create a client proxy class that allows your code to talk to a web service that is described via wsdl and communicates via soap or http get posters indicate that it is only but web references can also talk to web services or or ruby so long as they all talk wsdl and conform to the interoperability service reference will create a client proxy class that communicates with a service regardless of whether that wcf service is a web service or

answer the question in your answer how do you get a form to post to different actions depending on the button that is you could change the action attribute of the form using javascript depending on the maybe you mean you just want to post a form to a different action than what is used to render the then just output your own form tag using the url helper for the action a non javascript solution would be to always have the form posted to the same action using different buttons and then decide what to do depending on the name of the button param named after the button clicked will have a value in your action

answer your actual you will get an ienumerator that is bound to the state of the list as it was when you asked for further operations operate on the using a for you are making a sequence if calls to get a particular item by there an outside context such as the enumerator that knows that in a for all the collection only asking for one since the collection never handed out an no way for it to know that the reason asking for item then item then item etc is because walking the mucking with the list at the same time as walking going to get errors either if adding then the for loop may skip some while the foreach loop will if removing then the for loop may throw an index out of range if but will probably work most of the i think you understand all your question was simply why two ways of iterating behaved the answer to that is the state of the collection is the when you call getenumerator in one and when you call in the other

anyone used the i am using it right it but it is typically quite a bit of coding for the graphical i currently am struggling to leverage the ibm uml etc built on top of good or bad experiences you made using looking back on my initial dives into etc i can say for study the there are important patterns that you have to on from the examples and not the i would also suggest a new book modeling a language specific for gmf modeling in i paged through it and it seemed to be the missing manual to some of the more basic why the book is good is that is focuses on the key to making useful through constraining it to a specific domain and providing a tool that only allows for valid models to be there is not a lot of documentation online and the api only tells you so watch out for loops caused by calling or other set methods on it crashes the eclipse not oh yes and the apis are split between eclipse help documentation versions or included at alternatives for graphical modeling you could uml profiles with custom images and icons rather than full shape it takes about 2 hours to put together a pretty good editor building on top of uml graphical objects and uml the ibm rsm tool uml profile tooling project does this there is a lot you can do with constrained uml profiles eclipse or entering gmf land is more than a order of magnitude effort from 1 to 10 hours no pure dsl specific tools out google will provide a good from what i have seen the main reason to use gmf is eclipse integration and leveraging existing this is why i use yourself do i need model which is or do i need a tool for creating instances of this if there are only expert users there may not be a need for a sleek	
anyone we have a sql server 2005 database installed its an sql server 2000 attached to an sql server 2005 with the default server language language usa with dateformat like and we really need to keep it this way but currently just uploaded a new database to the server and this needs to have the dateformat for i force a change just on a database and not the whole if i force the change on the whole server it will make all my other apps example currently we have this sql statement which from sesiones where of course we can add this which now from sesiones where the problem being is that there are a large number of sql statements within the the truth being is that the application is fairly old and we really want to make any changes to the source hence if we could force a a change just on the database the tables of specific database then this would help really dateformat on a sql server db and not on whole server to

are a couple different answers to this and it is a bit but some reasons i can think of are classes are reference if using 16 bytes for total probably not worth it to create memory references to 8 for each you have really small they can often be pushed onto the il instead of references to the this can really speed up some as eliminating a memory dereference on the callee is a bit of extra associated with classes in and if your data structure is very none of this fluff would be used so just extra junk you most important difference between a struct and a is that structs are value type and classes are reference

are a number of ways you can do in your main thread to wait in a blocking fashion for each thread to in a polling fashion generally discouraged to wait until each thread has for each thread in call to call a method in your and program each thread to throw an uncaught exception when it locks or synchronizers or mechanisms from create a listener in your main and then program each of your threads to tell the listener that they have to implement idea one way is to first create an interface threadcompletelistener void thread create the following abstract class notifyingthread extends thread private final new public final void threadcompletelistener public final void threadcompletelistener private final void for listener public final void try finally public abstract void then each of your threads will extend and instead of implementing it will implement thus when they they will automatically notify anyone waiting for in your main class the one that starts all the threads at least the object waiting for modify that class to and immediately after creating each thread add itself to the list of thread1 new add ourselves as a start the as each thread your method will be invoked with the thread instance that just completed that better would be to rather than for as extending thread is usually discouraged in new but coding to your if you change the class to implement then you have to change some of your code that manages which is pretty straightforward to

are really 2 types of static that are static because they can that are static because they have to a small to medium size code base you can really treat the two methods you have a method that is in the first category and you need to change it to access class relatively straight forward to figure out if possible to turn the static method into a instance a large code the sheer number of call sites might make searching to see if possible to convert a static method to a non static one too many times people will see the number of and say i better not change this but instead create a new one that does what i can result in lot of code explosion in the number of method of those things are my advice would be that if you have a code base over 200k that i would only make methods static if they are refactoring from to static is relatively easy add a so if you want to make a into an actual static later you need functionality outside of an then you the inverse turning a into a instance method is much more large code bases better to error on the side of ease of rather than on the side of idealogical for big projects make things static unless you need them to for small just do what ever you like

been using facelets for a little over a one of the main advantages i see in java web frameworks is that it helps to keep the code clean and promotes for in you get any scriptlets in your pages like you do in seen asp files in production that are over 3000 lines nothing inherently wrong with asp or but it does make it quite easy to lump some business logic in the no until someone else has to maintain frameworks try to you keep a more strict separation of mvc or whatever model they which in turn leads to cleaner templates whatever and business and domain code that is automatically unit using many of the frameworks can take a bit more time up but save you many times that when it comes to maintenance and

blank line is somewhat easier for repeated entry of multiple after the user finishes one record the user just tabs again to a newly created blank line and keeps no need to reach for the the use of a blank line also results in the records being in the order the user making it easy to check work as one if you know the task is to enter records the table is you can the cursor in the blank row to save the user the trouble of finding and clicking the insert insert button is somewhat easier for adding records intermixed among other the user have to scroll to the end of the table before which generally takes longer than hitting a button and makes a user lose place in the for tables already filled with an insert button may be more discoverable than the blank line assuming the button is always in view blank at the bottom is scrolled out of and user may not think to scroll down and find of have both an insert button and a blank or otherwise try to have the best of both for you can have the insert button but if a table is you can open it with a blank line for the tabbing from the last field in the last line could be an means of inserting a line for data entry or the insert button can have an accelerator key maybe so the data entry users can use it to insert multiple records without their fingers leaving their the insert button maybe should also insert a new record below the current one so that new records are in the order they are

both and are equivalent apart from the possibility of calling on a instance would give you a you override the functionality of either of them independently not sure that would ever be a good idea unless trying to work around the shortcomings of another which would mean you could make them find people on both sides of the aisle as to the one to i prefer the operator rather than the talking about likely a better idea to use instead of either one of those

building a heavily crud based website and got to the phase of the project where trying to build a search webpage that shows the user different subsets of a certain important table based on parameters they enter such as dates and different text use a fixed sql because depending on whether they search by date or by something the sql would be so instead i have been generating a results list using a table web control that starts out invisible and then is filled and set to visible once the user identifies a search they want to i used a table control because its easy to create and modify in the code and i was able to make the needed calls to the database and populate that table as the second thing i need with this search is the ability to allow the user to select a record from the results and then go edit it using the rest of the crud based pages on the to do i created in the table and gave them all different ids and the same event but since i created the buttons it seems the event disappears on callback and my scheme so taking a second look at how to do current code for the events looks tempcell new button tempbutton new new results table is declared like like to be able to identify which record the user so i can send that info on to another and of i still need to be able to generate results for several different search currently i have template and code based searches that lead to different stored procedures and different parameters based on what the user has suggestions on it seems like the data grids and repeaters require sql statements in advance to work so not sure how to use but if i could then the item command approach would work with the is the best approach for this crud search page in

came from webform development like from up until when i discovered mvc it took me about 6 months to convince my peers my that it is the way to of the highlights of my control of html ajax of update of using jquery exponentially increased of concern and faster is a little bit but i did try to prove it by building for my i built a simple dashboard web using both webform and i showed my peers and my boss the as well as the complexity of building and maintaining each in the we migrate our main methodology from webform to is true that it takes a while to some webform but once you get mvc is so much easier to pick up and you can run with yes it is but often in large we spend a lot of our time trying to or a server control to behave and perform like the way we want it and as complexity of the system goes the complexity of this customization also goes up ajax is also quite difficult in updatepanel has its but nested update panels has its own share of problems as me and my it boils down to the ability to control our instead of automatically generated by the framework but we have to spend a lot of time and effort to get the rest combined with and your prefered biz tier framework or is extremely so far to we have released 3 production releases with mvc and they all perform well heck take a look at uses mvc

could limit the features of your developers can use by writing the restrictions into your coding then when code is reviewed prior to check any code that breaches these rules should be spotted and the check in one such case could well be extension your developers will want to use the new features all developers if got well documented reasons why they be good developers will follow you should also be open to revising these rules as new information comes to vs 2008 you can specify which version of you want to target click over the solution and select properties if you limit yourself to then you get any of the new features in obviously this help if you want to use some of the i think your fears over are is still as strongly typed as declaring something as simply tells the compiler to pick the best type for this the variable change type always an or or personally i follow the same rules as paul if the type is clear from the syntax then use a if not name the type

could simply store a reference to the frame but this is probably a bad this keeps the frames and also holds references to all the local variables so it may impact performance if they happen to be using large chunks of and could have even worse effects if relying on finalization to destroy resources like locks and filehandles when they go out of means need to hold a string representation of the stacktrace which is not ideal for your purposes to actually do some processing to get even though rarely there seem to be much way around though you could consider disabling it until you set some configuration that way get better performance for the common but could still enable the setting when trying to diagnose your calling function alone some small number of parent is enough to distinguish the route the trace is always the same when called via and no func2 vs to distinguish between you could maintain a hash based on filename and line number of the calling frame the last two calling frames however this probably match your and where it end up with bogus stack that if you do want the using is probably a better way to get

current solutions all seem to count in and therefore also count in constructors of base but that solution has an implicit conversion from bool this the tricky is that the construction of a derived the object temporary has intermediate base and with virtual base this situation is even in that the intermediate type even such there are a few solutions to the a flag to disable counting a protected base class constructor which the instance count of your base classes in derived constructors the counts in a dedicated virtual base latter option base is probably the the compiler will enforce initialized once and only from the final counter struct pertypecounter static int count points to count

data is using the routing functionality of the mvc in windows forms we have this approach of fetching data with urls from a am not sure how this model could fit into windows think pretty hard to create something like dynamic data for windows biggest concern is once you created that how do you configure i mean if you want to change 1 form to be a bit different than the others think its better to generate forms for the various tables in the database using a powerful grid control from one of the big and then you can configure this is a different approach then the dynamic data where no code is generated before compile

default behavior has been changed in the	
default character set of urls when used in html pages and in http headers is called or iso not the same as and not the same as but it does fit into the range 0 to 127 is a lot like and the whole range 0 to 255 is the same as the range of you can generate it from a string by casting each character to a or you can use to get an object to do the conversion for this character the uk pound symbol is rfc that unencoded text must be limited to the traditional us ascii and anything else the special url delimiter must be but it leaves open the question of what character set to use for the upper half of the making it dependent on the context in which the url that context is defined by two other http and which do specify the default character and which together create a practically irresistable force on implementers to assume that the address bar contains that refer to the character set of content sent via except where otherwise so by the time a url string appears in the http get it ought to be in other factor is that html also uses as its and urls typically originate as links in html so when you craft a simple minimal html page in the urls you type into that file are in sometimes described as in the but not just that fill in the blank left by the rfc for for the advice on encoding of a character of a followed by hexadecimal of the code point for the is another name for much for the paste this into save it as an and open it in a few click the link and google should search for uk works in apple google chrome i have any others available right

develop solutions with both filemaker and our recommendation is to do the web app in a web app optimised technology like said filemaker does have a solid php api so if the web app has relatively lightweight demands in house then use that and save yourself the trouble of ess technology filemaker use an sql db as the backend data which gives you 2 ess as a nice tight way to synchronise right within filemaker that way have a data source to work with within the filemaker solution per ess to allow filemaker to be used as a query and edit tool directly on the mysql tables it works found building a sophisticated application in filemaker with backend to be very so whether you select 1 or 2 from above depends on how sophisticated and heavy duty that filemaker usage syncdek has a good reputation as a third party solution for automating	
developer of industrial vision applications i frequently have rather clunky images like 6000x4000pixels and the camera and imageprocessing is working on a steady stream of new images this processing is the main i would like to allow the user to comfortably view some other image in this on the processor steals way too much for example it takes us seconds to analyse the image but seconds to show it with a single zoom to fit some let alone let the user move on and dive into photoshop allows to show and zoom by the help of the graphic very fast memory and processing i wondered if anyone can give me an idea if and how i can experiment on this in my own data to graphic card long may this take for my 76mb of and let it show in some control without much effort to zoom and move in it by user to the for user need for 3d just moving and resizing in a is to enable fast and comfortable viewing with low processor is this possible texture or something the are there limitations with current of can somebody suggest some durations to expect for any big images by directx

developing a dynamic html window absolute positioned using jquery that automatically centers itself on the it can also accommodate content that fits or exceeds the dimensions of the window idea is that our customer clicks a link next to our product listing and then this window comes up and displays its sales each sales letter also contains a video that further describes the window will remain at the center of the screen until it is dismissed by either clicking the close button in the window or clicking outside of it remains in the center by adjusting its absolute positioning based upon where the user scrolls and if they resize the problem is in the video in all other browsers except firefox all the video is rendered perfectly within the window as the user scrolls around the document or resizes the in when the user and the window adjusts its absolute positioning the video looks like it smudges from where it was originally to where it is now or the video screen goes thought maybe what needed to be done is force firefox to redraw the video i tried a few different ways to accomplish simply making the element disappear and reappear quickly seem to do the if i quickly adjusted its margins or position back and it seemed to i was going to go with this but as i began to test it across other this motion seemed to slow down the specifically i noticed it in chrome tested it on the other browsers thought about limiting this fix to but the browser data field in jquery was deprecated in i could always make the javascript myself to identify the but i was wondering if there was a better way to go about forcing the browser to redraw the video or maybe on the wrong track and it need to be using firefox chrome internet explorer 7 and safari input would be appreciated the code for the wigglevids i changed the code so that way embeded elements are wiggled only when the popup position has instead of binding it to the window scroll this has sped up execution a but its still not there quite its still a noticeable following i changed the code so that the embeded videos in the popup window are stored in an this when this function gets executed the browser have to search the dom again and again for the embeded myvids is globally declared and cleared when the popup if 0 if 0 var ctr ctr var myobj var temp var suffix var currentmargin suffix suffix 2 temp var newmargin currentmargin newmargin currentmargin 1 do i force firefox to redraw a video

documentation seems quite minimal i think there is a huge user community for use of the rpc apis but my guess is that in order to set up the pipe it is necessary for rpc to internally call only one call to that api is able to block at a fact that you see the problem only occasionally suggests that it is so is it possible that you are making two such calls on different threads and sometimes they will be that or there is a bug in the rpc implementation and you will have to work around it by retrying the call may be an effective workaround in any

doing sounds pretty good to capacity is cheap and minimising network usage is you could have the server for each what last dataset and send only the differences a list of deletions and on each if you sort your data rows these differences can be calculated fairly efficiently using a differencing algorithm such as that used by approach is sensitive to network outages if one response is not received by the errors will however this can be remedied by having the client sent the md5 hash with each if it is different than what the server an entire list will be sent instead of a list of

for me at is about three key so content can be remixed in ways that exploit a network effect amongst generated content exploiting network effects to capture exponentially more useful data from the odd one but it really did change the way people make but in some senses as fundamental as the first are mostly business social and only one purely technological change have a technical but are only a big deal for business people a speaker at linked data planet describe the linked data sem web trend as done i think an important those apis are all present data in different are or rest or and there is no set of tools for combining the data and querying it in a the word reveals something of the effort involved in downloading the data and combining it by brute force coding or computational semantic web cures that by model of data rather than or url centric access model essentially with rdf used in the and for http urls to identify abstract such as or models of rather than just big change is switching from a web of documents to a web of specifically web of data with unique dereferencable http granularity will opening a blue ocean of things which can all participate in a the ford have a collection of documents that happen to describe ford and each model of the company and the models are not first class given the protocols and data models are all standardized the obstacles that get in the way of dealing with those concepts as first class entities drop tools will translate and combine data linking and not in in differing concrete models very easily because the abstract model is this is not ai some ai tools have been to its the same type of activity as with web but without all the brute force mashing and and it will be more powerful for to its not really anything new and is simply a standardization and evolution of technology that is either current or but it will be used in a radically different way to talk about things other than will evolve many senses has in parallel with the current as a critical mass of people get their heads around the of rdf data put data in rdf and not bother writing bespoke they are and they need to this will be the inflection point between and	
for real because all of java is still the application can use our existing common these libs have been built in java over the past 10 and important for access to other systems within the the most crucial thing about enterprise applications is getting too rigid is what makes most enterprise apps decay and eventually there are two problems that lead to this and scala helps avoid both of one problem is just the sheer volume of java works better than c or but it still requires many more lines of code to implement an application than scala combating the code size problem requires higher degrees of customizable why we deploy java ee apps that have twenty to fifty jar files in their that structure itself is necessary to get the app but it can create its own problem in terms of conceptual immune from an overload of conceptual but the common programming style in scala tends toward more concrete programs rather than libraries for frameworks for building if you actually do need libraries for frameworks for building where being able to call back into java comes in	
for standard j2ee projects i use directly sql constructs or orm framework to manage data into forms and so but of course enterprise environments bother much about access performances at the same what could it be the most performance suited strategy for an user forum of up 50 users and you any in my opinion i must keep a fast access index of all messages at data but i am in doubt for using plain text or a database visually my idea is to build up all on a top of a message list linked only to the access and then using ajax to get message details and so i can divide the application flows into two separate one aimed to serve fast content and the other to serve complex data user details and so forum application must fits well on any data and java please do not phpize my question the best strategy to build up a forum using java and combining

from a perspective you should be asking the difference between web applications and client within each you can ask about the difference between standard web applications and mobile web apps and standard client apps and mobile client difference between web and client applications is that web applications lack every page request is completely from every other page it is only through various technical that web applications manage to maintain the illusion that a web app user is running a coherent application as they navigate from page to in for the isapi dll manages a object that pulls a session cookie from the page request and then provides uses it to identify the session data appropriate for the handling of the a client by every aspect of the application is targeted at a single user and the of the application is a given as you navigate from dialog to in the tight integration of the application with the computer permits the use of resources in a web by there is little or no access to these resources except as mediated by the browser a client not a web web applications just web applications with two the screen size is considerably smaller and the browser capabilities are generally less write a mobile web app in pretty much the same way as a standard web app but you can not count on some of the capabilities that you usually have with a this last by the is rapidly going away as mobile devices become more applications require a development deployment that is specific to the mobile the tools and techniques used in standard client application development map particularly well to the mobile need to learn new controls and the only real exception to this rule are the tools available through microsoft has attempted to provide as much commonality as possible even find that you have a different mind set and different constraints than when developing a winforms this

gstring concept in groovy is pretty powerful let you do things hello program trying to figure out if using groovy can introduce security problems in your code similar to sql injection the example above the code was written by the author of the so the execution of the command cannot be seen as a security flaw as it was the stated intent of the say writing a grails where user input is taken from form fields and database tables assume that an attacker controls both sent as requests to the server and in the code in my app looks like str1 str2 here is some and there any way an attacker can execute code in the above why my initial hypothesis is that gstring usage is always please feel free to prove me please be as concrete as to keep the discussion please disregard any problems in the code since this question is about on the not on the some people have pointed out that it is a good idea to filter out unwanted while filtering out bad might certainly save you from some classes of security it would be even better to write code that would be safe even without you can compare it with usage of preparedstatements in the java jdbc api correct usage of preparedstatements is to save you from certain classes of injection filtering your sql input will probably give you the same but using preparedstatements strictly dominates the filtering approach use of in

has already been mentioned several you normalize a zero your options the zero a bit indicating if the vector was successfully in addition to the result if an 4 is not very good because some languages as have and normalizing a vector is typically found in very throwing an exception is rather and any code that may want to handle the vector case is going to be given an unnecessary performance hit when that 1 has the problem that the return value have a unit and so it could silently introduce bugs in the calling code that assumes the resulting vector has unit 2 has a similar problem to option but because nans are usually much more noticeable than it will likely manifest more think option 3 is the best although it does make the interface more instead of now have to say something success vector was vector was zero

has been my experience been involved in fixing database problems for around 30 years and have dealt with hundreds of different that all too many of the problems in database performance are from the inappropriate attempts to reuse functions are far slower than inline cursors reusing a stored proc that inserts one record at a time are far slower than reusing a proc that gives back what you need and ten other fields is wasteful of server and network using an existing view that joins to ten tables when you only need information from three of them is wasteful of server code reuse in databases is not nearly as good a thing as it is in other this is not to say that code be reused if need just that it should never take precedence over databases are unfortunately not well designed to reuse most databases are not object oriented and thinking in designing or accessing them will often result in a poor you can even think about code you need to have a rock solid normalized database you need to think about how you will be extracting as well as inserting data into the you need to think about how well will this work once there are many users and records because redesigning a basic database structure at this point often becomes too expensive and time it is often far easier to refactor the application code than the basic database structure far too the database refactoring does not get if you change the table structure to go from a denormalized table to a parent child structure because you find out the current structure suiting your then you may end up changing hundreds or even thousands of queries against this this is why it is important to spend a lot of time on database you get the chance to revisit it later due to if you think of the database as the foundation of the house and the application code as the structure you will see why this is it is far harder to change the foundation with the structure on top of it than it is to move the internal databases and the applications which access them are the same

have a pretty good experience with both mysql and i found postgresql to be more faster and better but i recommend it you have to know what looking for in a db to be able to i had experience in putting postgresql to be a good replacement for sql server in environments where we migrated everything from sql server to and did much better with the same hardware from windows to linux as also gives you way more options to optimize your and tune your database in general as long as know what you can mess around as you wish in its configuration one thing that kills me in mysql is the damn it kills a file that can be and nowhere to be you can even have a file in your home dir and depending on your configuration and how you invoke your it can wildly interfere with the works of the had serious troubles with servers with randomly placed giving me big headaches to find in the world was mysql getting its much better to have just one or two as postgresql also found postgresql to be a decent replacement for oracle in certain where oracle really necessary to begin but somehow somebody got convinced business person flooded with the nonsense sales arguments probably was the person who made the and bought it was totally and we could replace it without any major problems by it was a while version of but yet it made a good job in replacing it was a fairly big database and postgresql was up to the postgresql supports some nice features like stored procedures can be in or whatever languages postgresql supports also have some experience with and have worked with it since its version so for a mysql is generally very good if you mind about the inner workings of the or if you need a competent database to do something cool and it can be really really and you can really get in trouble and get cornered in the future if you think about what one thing that i hate the most is the ability to choose your storage while it sounds great in i can all it is in reality not very the main flaw with it is no matter which engine you always gain and lose stuff in for if you want referential integrity foreign keys and you use and humble along with the poorer not necessarily just worse performance of innodb also features lots of silly size and quantity of you have tables with more than 1000 columns in it literally kills mysql when we talk about data gives me the feeling that mysql is a sewed thing between many different other products used to be a company in the db you just have to download the source code of both to see the while the source code of postgresql is more source code is source tree is not as organized as and oh that makes a huge difference when you another fact that supports my argument about the source code is the build postgresql build is much faster than sometimes i think that rebuild my kernel is faster than rebuilding killer thing for if in the business of selling as in a software house or software provider or something like is their crappy licensing i but they have an enterprisey license mode as and if you want to package mysql for distribution with your you just do it without paying them royalties fees and on the other is licensed under so you can do just whatever you want with it even improve it and sell a also another aspect that like to mysql is actively maintained by mysql a privately held and postgresql is totally supported by the opensource no strings attached to any the query oh let me start on the query mysql query planner just not for from but if you go deeper and starts to put queries with and the planner just gives up on you and starts to read each row in the bringing your application wake you up in the middle of the getting directly to the mysql is great if you want have a kind of reliable to use in simple mysql easy synchronization come in handy when we need to build a high availability and is also great for load use any kind of lamp you name just and works and is easy to at cheap hosting company is better if need to have a more reliable solution to supply your business something that can to and replace sql server and is supports advanced database like stored procedures in many different different transaction isolation synchronization is not as trivial as in but it just works other resources that may be

i sometimes find that private inner classes which implement a public interface can be very helpful for objects composed of seen this discussed in the context of creating uis with allen but not much beyond as far as i know it have a say you have a collection interface that can provide an interface public iterator interface public boolean public object you have a stack that implements then you could implement its iterator as a private inner class stack implements public iterator return new private class iteratorimpl implements public boolean public object has complete access to all of private methods and at the same is invisible to all except stack and its iterator will tend to be tightly worst implementing iterator as a public class might force you to break the private inner class lets you avoid either you avoid polluting the class hierarchy with something really an implementation

i think the answer depends on the nature of the business application that you are what are the slas for your how mission critical is your messaging infrastructure does the application continue to function aside from the lock if then you probably have an obligation to make sure your concurrency control mechanism the single point of the topic of achieving a truly pessimistic locking mechanism requires one to address the of most pessimistic locking algorithms rely on there being a serialized authority that can respond to requests for locks a table or perhaps a singleton lock a design has single point of failure written all over to answer your first seen business applications use messaging to provide pessimistic fully solving the fault tolerance problem seems like overkill for most business applications concurrency control does not have this problem by its nature which is why generally preferred in i realize that business requirements frequently win out over the topic interests google has published an article on their lock which leverages the consensus

i understand i think the problem here is that trying to solve the problem using a very simple what you need to be doing is creating your own workflow system for such a task and also try to separate out some of the logic from the ui handling mvc framework would be ideal for though i see you are using which nonetheless a big now this necessarily need to be start off by breaking down the actions performed by your application into some sort of flow if you can see pretty straightforward then it may just be a matter of implementing a basic state as a general pointer to dealing with states in web applications all have a read through some of the links on afraid i really provide you with anything more specific from what described missing something obvious if like to clarify the tasks that your app needs to then i might be able to give some code but i suspect that just treating this problem a flow perspective should give you a good	
i understand the problem of finding the longest simple path in a graph is since you could then easily solve the hamiltonian circuit problem by setting edge weights to 1 and seeing if the length of the longest simple path equals the number of question what kind of path would you get if you took a found the maximum edge replaced each edge weight with and ran a standard shortest path algorithm on clearly not the longest simple since if it then np and i think the proof for something like that would be a bit more complicated simple

ideas off the top of my process monitor process to check what goes on during a build this will let you see if is for instance in mind that response files are probably created with which should prevent disk writes if moved my to a and that gives me minor speedups in a ramdisk that supports automatically disk so you have to use boot scripts to do sequential of a single disk image is faster than syncing a lot of small your header files on the and override your compiler standard paths to use the ramdrive will likely not give much of an improvement after as the os caches the standard your source files on your and sync to the ramdisk the other way check out for doing realtime synchronization between folders it achieves this via a filter so only synchronizes what is necessary only does changes 4kb write to 2gb file will only cause 4kb write to the target figure out how to make your ide build from the ramdrive although the source files are on your and keep in mind that need a ramdrive for large

implemented a couple of systems that mimiced what olap cubes and here are a couple of things we did to get them to the core data was held in a n dimensional all in and all the keys were implemented via hierarchies of pointers to the underlying in this way we could have multiple different sets of keys for the same the data in the array was the equivalent of the fact often it would only have a couple of pieces of in one instance this was price and number the underlying array was often so once it was created we used to remove all the blank cells to save memory lots of hard core pointer arithmetic but it as we had heirarchies of we could write routines quite easily to drill a hierarchy for instance we would access year of by going through the months which in turn mapped to days at each level we would aggregate data as part of building the cube made calculations much we implement any kind of query but we did support drill down on all axis 7 in our biggest and that was tied directly to the ui which the users we implemented core stuff in but these days i reckon could be fast but worry about how to implement sparse that sound

interface definition language is used to set up communications between clients and servers in remote procedure calls there have been many variations of this such and sun onc dce rpc and so you use idl to specify the interface between client and server so that the rpc mechanism can create the code stubs required to call functions across the needs to create stub functions for the client and a using the idl very similar to a function prototype in c but the end result is slightly such client main server function this instead of calling in the same calls a client stub function the same prototype as which is responsible for packaging up the information and getting it across the wire to another this can be the same machine or a different it really matter one of the advantages of rpc is to be able to move servers around at the a process that will receive that information and pass it to the the stub receives the unpacks it and passes it to the real real function then does what it needs to and returns to the server stub which can package up the return information return code and any or and pass it back to the client client stub then unpacks that and passes it back to actual details may differ a little but that explanation should be good enough for a conceptual actual idl may look void int int that stuff at the top is basically networking the meat of it is inside the interface section where the prototypes are this allows the idl compiler to build the x stub and x server functions for compiling and linking with your client and server code to get rpc does use idl think they have a midl for com also used third party products with ms operating both dce and onc

is a lot of enthusiasm around mvc right but if you are starting a new dev project right now still recommend that you carefully consider before jumping on the mvc train just most dev teams on any there are some serious here are the ones i find most requires much more skill from your they will need significant expertise in the inner workings of as well as a good understanding of how http for the client side code they will need strong javascript and jquery and on the server side an advanced grasp of oo and if you plan to get the most from experience with unit testing and mocking frameworks mvc framework currently get much in the way of rad features from visual you get a text editor and but about no no no property while this really that it does often mean that building uis will take significantly especially for less experienced is very and so code and sample apps are very hard to come by and tend to be very limited in documentation is also a bit thin at the biggest drawback to the mvc framework is the lack of an established and mature 3rd party market around with web forms there are tons of very advanced ui suites and components on the market and tons of open source projects you can borrow many especially business apps the lack of 3rd party and advaned grid controls for the mvc framework alone should be a major is and i highly recommend it if you are in a position where you can use but there are real costs and risks for any significantly complex project that may keep you on web forms for a while do expect that the next major version of mvc will probably address many of those especially with the lack of rad i also expect that the enthusiasm around mvc will bring a lot of 3rd party support to the platform but it will take some time for all that to get well

is kind of hard to give you a good answer as there are lots of unknowns but i will give it show most often heard issue with and wf is that both use the threadpool and are not aware of each this problem depends mostly on your site are wf by default uses only a few threads in the threadpool per proc to execute workflows and another for the the problem is usually solved by using the manual wf scheduler as wf then uses the host ie the one used by now this can be good or bad depending on your first of all the threadpool size has been growing and is now up to 250 threads per proc so threadpool starvation is unlikely to be an issue unless it is a high load a downside of using the manual scheduler is that all ie the become if you need something from the workflow to finish the request but if it is fire and forget your request is now waiting for the workflow to finish or reach some idle so in some cases you will be better off with the default scheduler in you it all depends on what you are doing and the server thing to keep in mind is that iis will recycle the appdomain after a specific i believe 25 hours by or number of when that happens the wf runtime is destroyed with the next request i recreated in another if you are not using persistence all your workflow state will be lost and existing workflows will be depending on the amount of time a workflow takes this could be a problem or may not hard to tell from my

it be simpler to simply create a separate thread with its own message queue for your i think casyncsocket needs to be created on the main message just some message see the documentation for cwinthread to see how to create a separate thread with its own message it is crucial that you call all socket operations from the context of the new mfc uses global state in hidden classes that use storage to hold and that information is used in many of the that means casynchsocket has thread affinity and you must always use and create it in whatever thread is to be its message approach would be to create a create your own custom mfc hidden window on that thread creating the window in the context of that and create messages and message handlers on that window for all of the socket operations you assure that the thread is pumping messages method does and then messages to your window to control your remember that callbacks from your socket will come in on a separate thread than your ui or worker need to worry about race conditions and possibly gui thread affinity issues if updating gui worried about the design just create your own cthreadsafeasynchsocket proxy object and delegate to the real implementation through to your hidden you can use sendmessage for blocking operations and postmessage for asynchronous if you wrap the constructor in a factory you can delay creation of the socket thread until its last concern i can think of is that need to detect when all your proxies have gone away and shut down the you can use a global reference count managed by the to detect when to shut down the failing to shut down the thread will keep your app hanging about with a hidden window even after you close your main app

just one read quite a few books and yet to see anyone else saying use personally think properties are one of the best things about they allow you to expose state via whatever mechanism you you can lazily instantiate the first time something is used and you can do validation on setting a value when using and writing i just think of properties as setters and getters which a much nicer for the caveats with there are a one is probably a misuse of the other can be properties are types of it can be surprising if you place complicated logic in a property because most users of a class will expect the property to be fairly class explicitly obvious that calculation is being done public int return class not at all looks like it may just be returning a cached public int get return find that using methods for these cases helps to make a and more properties can have if you evaluate them while you have some property like int result get return suppose you have an exception that occurs when too many queries are guess what happens when you start debugging and rollover the property in the bad avoid doing looking at the property changes the state of the are the only caveats i i think the benefits of properties far outweigh the

know the world needs another like it needs a hole in the but writing your own framework is a great way of learning a i wrote a fairly complete one in php in under a fortnight and learned a hell of a lot about php and web development in the only reason i released it is because i was finally not happy with the way it managed session but that was a good learning experience think the way to begin framework design is to write down about 5 basic aims for for these at producing simple web apps with a dozen or so at people with a good knowledge of procedural code php or otherwise for that in sql programming described in on a vanilla state maintenance on was enough to get me other suggestion i can make is to try to build an app using the framewark at the same time as you build the framework this will quickly reveal problems and suggest ideas for new directions abd

least solaris has a limit of 256 file pointers because the structure stores the file descriptor in an unsigned char this is retained for backwards compatibility with some almost impossibly old versions of other platforms tempted to say most other platforms do not share that on the other it is relatively unusual for an ordinary user program to need that many files open it more often indicates a bug closing the files when finished with than having said it can be a problem for things like database servers which need to have lots of data files open at the same comment almost we have a large number of files but the server handles a large number of connections from socket handles and file descriptors seem to come from the same when we have a lot of fails because the call returns and fd are file descriptors at the system call so they come from the same place as regular file descriptors for you have to work around then you need to wrap your current socket opening code so that if it gets an file descriptor in the range then it calls to create a file descriptor in the range that stdio use and then close the original file the only snag with this is that you have to keep track of which file descriptors are because will merrily close the target file descriptor if it is currently assuming your socket code reads file descriptors and not file if the you have bigger problems too many things want to use the same resources and they all use them at the same

may be able to improve matters by building your list of keywords as a regular may allow them to be tested in but will very much depend on what the keywords are some work may be reused testing for and rather than searching every phrase from the start for each could do this by will actually return a match object on and none if not found this might be useful if you need to know which keyword how much this gains you will depend on the if you only have one or keep your current if you have a large it may be worth tring and profiling to see which performs how the approaches do for your good1 good2 good3 bad1 for this your approach performs far better than the regex whether this will always be the case depends a lot on the number and complexity of and the input data that will be for large numbers of and lengthy lists or rarely matching regexes may work but get timing and perhaps try even simpler optimisations moving the most common words to the front of your keyword sometimes the simplest approach really is the updated the table with and a similar approach before applying the i also added 2 new 500 1000 the first of which 500 1000 none of which show up the various strengths and joining does do worse when a match would immediately be found there is an always cost in joining the list this is a best possible case for the linear search however for it performs better when there are a large number of items in the

my this depends on how tightly bound to the component the connections if the connections are to a database that will only be used by the then it make sense to force the users of the component to know anything about those in that keeping the connection strings in a configuration file works or in it might be adequate to keep the connection strings internal to the but to expose the database server name in the config the component is using the same database as the users of the then permit the connection to be passed in as a property of the the component could the choose whether to default to a connection string if the property is not or to throw an exception if the property is not you mind exposing the entire connection string to the then allow the entire string to live in or in use the application settings feature this will cause defaults to be compiled into the yet when the component is these defaults will get written into the they may be edited from you want to limit the parts of the connection string that can be then compile those parts into the expose individual properties for the parts allow to in expose database server application these properties would set the corresponding parts of the connection see the if you already know about

nothing wrong with separating entities from the you can do this easily with entity you can have multiple entities mapping to the same table or set of each with different sets of on the other also no reason not to standardize on a common if data service 1 wants to update just the brand and it can have an updatebrandandcolor it need to pass the entire just its brand and same with and tire there should only be a single bicycle entity type returned from the getbicycle

now completed my first web application using mvc and i still am not grasping why this is getting all the praise and maybe being i know that what makes mvc great is that is forces separation between the presentation layer and the business object or data layer along with its stateless i also know that when you are working with the it appears that the code is less readable my example i guess my question if the separation is the why not just forms view forms code code controller new pagetext pagetitle i might be being but one of the things that i really liked in webforms is the ease in setting object properties like datasources and text it seems like this is completely different in mvc and less readable which makes me wonder about long term looking into the typed i think the readability of the code is substantially mvc	
now have a lot of fields and tables in our and beginning to look quite for historical we just reset the schema back to basics for each we might need some of the data from the old you might need not would code the generically this means having a system that can handle any form of stand area configuration the example you and maybe more in the future if that should you have tables like in then you would have objects in your model to match these these could both extend a common base class year one table gets data the next year another table gets the your dao will try to load each object from each table a and then set the standdata field in your object to whatever it other option is to just have all possible fields in a single and allow them to be

of the things working on right now has some similarities to a for purposes of going to explain my problem using an example drawn from a hypothetical call it the in you have a number of objects which periodically and randomly encounter as they a given may have or more on a that encounters for we might have four kinds of and three kinds of gravitywell blackhole speed power no effect invulnerable death effects of speed death shield phenomena on death power no effect may interact with each for a that is in both a and a may derive some kind of synergy between the generated and in such the synergistic effect is itself an for there might be a that results from this no information other than the set of acting on a is needed to resolve what the final result should may begin to see a problem emerging as a naive first every will have to know how to handle every or every will have to know about every this is obviously so we would like to move these responsibilities clearly at least one external class perhaps a or of some the best way to do the ideal solution will probably have these as easy to add a new as it is to add a new that produce no effect are the default and require additional code to convention over how interact with each other and is capable of managing these interactions to decide what the final result will already decided what my approach will i but interested to hear what the consensus where would you what avenues would you thanks for your what i wound up my main observation was that the number of different seems to be small relative to the number of possible that although there are many possible of the number of of of those interactions is a smaller can see for although there are 12 interaction combinations in the there are only five of modifications to modifications to modifications to introduced a third the to determine the result of it contains a dictionary that maps pairs to are basically a delegate that performs the effect and some each is handed an corresponding to the experiencing when the result of computing the interaction is then use the to determine the actual result of the on by adding modifiers to their existing attributes and like this never need to know about complexity of the relationship is abstracted into the details of how to resolve multiple and possibly complex effects is abstracted away by the ships only have to apply the effects as enables additional useful for the in which a ship processes effects could be differentiated by making an the default might be to process all a might ignore minor effects by having a different the best way to resolve a combinatorial explosion of

one difference to keep in has but haskell does which for one that you more things by simply looking at a haskell a haskell function takes a value of a type and returns that same value of that same you give it a it will return a give it a it will return a give it a it will return a you be so this is that in t because of subtyping you could call it like pers is of type the argument to the function is in fact might have a more specific type than just could even be an abstract guaranteeing that will have a more specific you can even with a function as simple as the type system already allows for a lot more than the stricter type system from while that might be useful to do some programming it also makes it harder to reason about a program by just looking a the types of things is a joy to do in a second there is polymorphism in via a mechanism known as eq a a a function checks if two values are but not just any two just the values that have instances for the this is sort of like constraints on type parameters in bool t where t is a for one the you could instantiate it with and call it with and there is also a difference in what this compiles the code compiles to almost exactly what its type the type checker makes sure the arguments implement the proper and than the haskell code complies to something like eqdict a a function gets an a dictionary of all the functions it needs to do the how you could use this and what it compiles equals 2 4 b1 equals inteqfunctions 2 equals true false b2 equals booleqfunctions true also shows what makes subtyping such a imagine if this where equals somestudent b3 equals personeqfunctions somestudent is the dictionary supposed to figure out if a is equal to a they even have the same while haskell type constraints at first sight might look like type they are implemented completely differently and compile to two really different

online security is a very important many businesses are completely based and there is tons of sensitive data available to check out only by using your web knowledge to secure my own applications ive found that im often testing others applications for exploits and security maybe just for as my knowledge on this field has expanded by testing on own reading zero day exploits and by reading the book web application hacker s discovering and exploiting security ive come to realize that a majority of online web applications are really exposed to a lot of security what do you in no interest of destroying or ruining but my biggest on hacking i decided to alert the administrators of the my inquiry was promptly and the security hole has yet not been why they wanna fix how long will it be before someone with bad intentions break inn and choose to destroy wonder why not more focus on this these and i would think there would be plenty of business opportunities in actually offering to test web applications for security is it just me who have a too big curiosity or is there anyone else out there who experience the it is punishable by law in norway to actually try break into a web even if you just check the source code and find the use it for your already breaking the van and exploiting how do you deal with any security holes you

or anything else that tries to evaluate processes that their is a very good reason why in you can only wait on your any method storing a that tries to work around that is flawed and has gaping holes in just say you need the process that monitors your process to be the what does this it means only the process that your process can reliably wait for it to in this is absolutely echo crashed with exit code sleep above piece of bash code runs in an the first line starts and waits for it to when it checks its exit if the exit status is it means it ended gracefully means you asked it to shut down and it did so in that case we want to restart it just asked it to shut if the exit status is will run the loop which emits an error message on stderr and restarts the loop to line 1 do we wait a because if wrong with the startup sequence of and it crashes have a very intensive loop of constant restarting and crashing on your the takes away the strain from all you need to do is start this bash script and it will monitor and restart it as if you want to start the monitor on boot the server you can schedule it in your with an open your cron rules with add a rule to start your monitor look at and you can add a line in there to have start at a certain init level and be respawned me add some information on why to use pid while they are very they are also very flawed and no reason why you just do it the correct recycling the wrong start write pid to while dies while any random process that starts it takes a random imagine it taking old notice reads checks to see if still finds thinks kills starts a new files go you need should i logic to check whether the pid file is and any such logic is again vulnerable to if you even have write access or are in a pointless see how simple my example above no need to complicate at the worse than pid files is parsing ever do is very while you find it on almost every unix its arguments vary greatly if you want and standard output is only for human not for scripted leads to a lot of false take the aux grep and now imagine someone starting a process with a number somewhere as argument that happens to be the same as the pid you stared your daemon imagine two people starting an x session and you grepping for x to kill just all kinds of you want to manage the process there are some perfectly good systems out there that will act as monitor for your look into for

our used scaleout stateserver commercial product to accomplish distributed caching replication of objects throughout a server farm for similar this has been quite although using objects does incur so in many cases we simplify what storing to just string values where fully evaluated the velocity since our usage started before that existed and we have time or compelling reasons to consider a switch at this but that obviously warrants some investigation if just starting i did indeed miss the important part about the question the flattening of object this may be things or have other but what if you took the approach of more closely simulating database storage in your distributed cache it to storing a single copy of each distinct object and using looser references to link those entities you have a which has a property and all containing objects that are instances of your have to use custom serialization to pull it and nothing will magically solve concurrency dirty update but the idea is that what put into the distributed cache would actually be all individual as well as a shallow copy of the instance that shallow copy would serialize the normal properties as well as unique identifiers for each reference contained within the original database a unique or whatever is rather than the person objects so have a instead of the and the members collection would serialize as a list of each person referenced is also stored as a separate where the concurrency trickiness comes into deserializing on depending on usage the group shallow copy would follow all person id references and those references with the real person objects stored separately in the distributed need to implement locking mechanisms to make sure updates to those which could be shared among many different were also need a versioning mechanism and a whenever necessary to up any changes to the person object made within the distributed does seem quite but the most generic approach i could think of without knowing the specifics of your use

point would be that you would salt the password in the same way when you are comparing it while logging a user in and while storing the having a good salt would prevent someone doing a standard lookup and it would also strengthen the hash against dictionary if the salt and the password are combined within a hash it would greatly reduce the use of offline attacks and you need to take any special precaution of protecting

primitive way to do it would be to look out for network disconnection your sequence would for network connections status maintain a list of all active network the first available network connection you could sort it based on interface and use the one with highest you detect a down use the next active if there are implications to the functionality of your based on which network connection you you are much better having either a routing protocol do the job for or have a tracking application within your this tracking application would track network paths various methods like across all your available interfaces to see which one can reach the ultimate and use the appropriate network you could monitor your network interfaces for not just status but also for and change your selection this would help you use the most efficient network at any given point of but this would need to be balanced with the churn caused by switching a network

question boils down to not use exception for that handling for regular program avoid all i could have googled i will provide an example you all can attack at and java too many have with plenty of types some of behaviour i like at for example 1 seen my vicious add some insult to this injury and even expand this behaviour say datetime know datetime is sealed in but for the sake of this using a pseudo language is exactly like except for the fact that datetime sealed overridden add method increments this date with a but loops the maximum value for datetime is timespan to incremented with the given if is the sum wil and continue from public datetime override return catch calculate how much the maxvalue is regular program timespan saldo ts return exception course an if could solve this just as but the fact remains that i just fail to see why you use exceptions that i can see that when performance is an issue that in certain cases exceptions should be think in many cases they are more clear than and break any contract the method is the use them for regular program everybody seems to have is not that well underbuild as the of that reaction can am i read other dealing with all kind of special but my point is if you are clear and hounour the contract of your nothing wrong with shoot not use exceptions as regular flow of

reading a question on difference between pointers and i decided that like to use references instead of pointers for my class however it seems that this is not because they cannot be declared uninitialized the particular scenario working on right i want to use normal variables the correct term for them by the because automatically initialized when i declare my bar1 is automatically instantiated with the default constructor what i causes a compiler error because you use uninitialized references and is happy as larry because pointers can be declared uninitialized the is it best practice to set this to bar bar bar looks like i have to use pointers in this is this the best way of using the the syntax is a bit tough what about is this attempting to implement a reference variable field in my class and initializing it in the why might i receive the following in constructor uninitialized reference member the real also tried doing this in the but no luck get the same there is a default i neglected it because i thought it relevant to the problem foolish of after removing the default constructor i caused a compiler error because the class is used with a which requires there to be a default so it looks like i must use a default and therefore must use a or is i use pointers for my class

short answer is that will remove a file from the will remove a module from the cache of previously loaded modules that the current python interpreter is when you import a the interpreter checks to see if there is a file of the same name as the file you are trying to if there and if the file has not changed since the file has been then python will load the file is significantly the file does not or the file has been changed since the file was then the file is loaded and a new file is is worth noting that simply running a python say will cause a to be only modules causes this to is another matter in order to speed up code which imports the same module python maintains a list of the modules that have been imported during the current interpreter if the module being imported is in then the cached version will be read nor files will be checked for on the python provides a builtin function which allows you to bypass the module cache and force a reload from get more information on module see the docs on

solution by while noble and well has a few so i thought provide my own problems with the tilde in expand to your homedirectory inside and neither when read by the statement or quoted in the which means get such file or off and such for basic operations is especially when using a crappy shell to avoid the weight of also noticed a few quoting for instance around a parameter expansion in his the solution cannot cope with filenames that contain no solution in can cope with them which is why i almost always prefer far more bulletproof harder to exploit when used using for your hashbang means you must avoid at all you can use all the you even on ubunutu or whatnot when honest and put at the a solution more probably and more echo exit the quotes around in the check will also fail if is so two checks in avoided regular expressions for a if you must use in you should be putting the regular expression in a in any globs like mine are always preferable and supported in far more bash

solution with examples in python as a good substitute for pseudo a grid 20 x that the tetrominoes fall are made up of which have attributes of coordinate and for the tetrominoe looks like 4 5 6 7 8 19 20 the is a collection of blocks with the coords the shape is a matter of applying a simple transformation to all the coords in the to move the shape down add left or right to all coords in the collection that make the also lets you use some simple trig to rotate the shape by the rule is that when rotating relative to an then becomes equal to is an example to explain taking the from use the as the centre block to rotate for make this the first coordinate in the here is a simple function to rotate that collection of coordinates by shape for selecting the x and y get the middle middle work out the coordinates of the other blocks relative to middle rel for coords in now rotate for coords in return if you apply this function to our collection of coordinate for the this out in the coordinate system and it looks like 4 5 6 7 8 18 19 20 was the hardest bit for hope this helps

start with seeing as the simplest as that can be repeatedly called without but when called will return a value and then suspend their when called they will start up from where they last suspended execution and do their thing generator is essentially a cut down the difference between a coroutine and generator is that a coroutine can accept arguments after been initially whereas a generator a bit difficult to some up with a trivial example of where use but my best take this python code as an while do some funky yield do some more funky the coroutine does some funky stuff to and returns a new x print example of where coroutines are used is lexers and without coroutines in the language or emulated lexing and parsing code needs to be mixed together even though really two separate but using a you can separate out the lexing and parsing going to brush over the difference between symmetric and asymmetric suffice it to say that you can convert from one to the and asymmetric are the most like the easier to i was outlining how one might implement asymmetric coroutines in are actually quite simple all they are functions representing another point in the program if you call will cause execution to automatically switch to the point that function you use very restricted versions of them every day without even realising for can be thought of as a kind of give you a python based pseudocode example of a python had a function called and this function took two the first being a and the second being a list of arguments to call it the only restriction on that function would be that the last argument it takes will be a function will be our current would happen is that would in turn call with the current continuation that a reference to the point in the program at which was when calls the current essentially the same as telling to return with the value calling the current continuation and when it does it rolls back the stack to where the current continuation was when you called result of all of this would be that our hypothetical python variant would print hope that and sure my explanation can be improved on quite a

strings are terminated by a character with the value zero this could be written like zero this work inside there is a special syntax used in string where the backslash works as an escape sequence and is followed by various such sequence is that simply means a character with the value you can write things like sequence uses a backslash followed by the letter and one or two hexadecimal to represent the character with the indicated using this you could write the zero byte as for the also support for such constants in base they use a backslash followed by the digit just as octal literal integer is thus a synonym for is sometimes useful when you need to construct a string containing or special control also a set of special such as for for and so

sure using an index otherwise doing a full table you can look at the execution plan to verify this or force the issue by using an clause an indexed here is table that large at 300k there are performance issues with getting near th eend of the table the only real solution for this is to to fake the limit have an auto increment field that numbers the rows from 1 to and then field between 250000 and that might be problematic or impossible if frequently deleting rows but i tend to find that older data tends to change less so you could somewhat optimize it by using for the first rows and the surrogate paging column beyond

suspect a risk of premature optimization be careful about your your approach is a property of right angle is that what you actually assuming your points are and so for the general case you have them implicitly representing two vectors form the origin these v1 so your angle is where is vector this faster the will depend on a lot of do you know the vector or have to compute how fast can you do a dot product in your how fast is at some point tricks like table lookup might help but that will cost you all there really a general answer to your added like to that often playing is is a bit of a mugs game with modern cpus and compilers you know until you measure it and grovel the generated when you hit the point that you really care about it at this level for a piece of you can find out in detail what your system is but maybe a table is but maybe got fast vector computations and a small it all amounts to sorry on the other if you reached the point that you really care so much about this bit of you probably be thinking about it at this level at make it make it clean means abstraction as well as then worry about the

taking advantage of short since js uses you can do a bunch of actions within a function and have it remain in that this is useful for invoking code that mess with the global it also allows one to make private variables if you declare a variable inside of an anonymous function and execute it only other code inside of the anonymous function can access that suppose i want to make a global unique id one might do code like counter genid counter counter return now anyone can mess with and now polluted the global namespace with two variables and i could use a anonymous function to generate my counter genid var counter var genidimpl counter counter return return i only have one variable in the global which is more the counter variable is now safe from being modified it only exists in the anonymous and so only the function genidimpl was defined in the same can access looks like in example they just want to execute code that pollute the global namespace at

the best way of implementing this kind of sorting suggest using the library implementation of with the distance to the target string as the sorting of course not a helpful why because what you really want to know is a good difference metric for answer to the qusetion it depends on which properties of the distance you care being read up on the levenstein distance and what it really says about the can modify the basic algorithm to skew the metric in favor of identical characters occurring in long runs by fiddling with the weighting of different steps in the dynamic programming can also use the soundex which says something about which strings sound similar that works best for short i know what kind of input you the strings are of equal you can also use the hamming distance the number of indexes where the strings that can probably be generalized to by counting indexes as always which gives you something short it given some but i say which is going to be a good decision without some more information from	
the best way to do this is to read the file and encode its contents in base64 by the code that instantiates the xslt the base64 string can either be passed as a parameter to the or the transformation could request it via an extension principle xslt could be used to do the encoding to however some byte such as 0 xml and xml and 29 other codes below 0x20 xml are forbidden as characters within an xml document and this makes such encoding in xslt

the other answers say about it being impossible to accurately predict the performance of code running on a modern cpu is but that mean the latencies are or that knowing them is exact latencies for intels and processors are listed in the manuals shown in can berk also has pdf manuals on their own website with the official tight knowing the latencies for each instruction can help a lot in manually trying to schedule your the programmer can make a lot of optimizations that the compiler the compiler guarantee it change the meaning of the this still requires you to know a lot of other details about the such as how deeply pipelined it how many instructions it can issue per number of execution units and so and of these numbers vary for different but you can often come up with a reasonable average that more or less works for all worth noting that it is a lot of work to optimize even a few lines of code at this and it is easy to make something that turns out to be a modern cpus are hugely and they try extremely hard to get good performance out of bad but there are also cases unable to handle or where you clever and making efficient and it turns out to slow the cpu in optimization table first column is instruction then there is a number of columns for latency for each the cpuid indicates which processor family the numbers apply and are explained elsewhere in the the latency specifies how many cycles it takes before the result of the instruction is so this is the number looking throughput columns show how many of this type of instructions can be executed per up xchg in this we see that depending on the cpu it takes and a mov takes looked up what each cpuid but i assume the are for pentium which ran some components of the chip at double allowing it to do things in half really see what you plan to use this information but if you know the exact cpu family the code is running then adding up the latency tells you the minimum number of cycles required to execute this sequence of

the thing it is about or or at some place in your writing a method to do say a public it should not assume much or anything about the caller it should merely do the job it is supposed to regardless of who is calling it and what context the caller is for some it cannot complete its then it needs to tell the caller i do and exceptions are an excellent mechanism to let it tell the caller that the only but the best mechanism ever seen for most when you throw the you have no idea whether it will be caught or not because exposing a public method and you have no idea who might choose to call it and catching of the exception is the job of the for say writing a library with public methods that might throw say using that library from a windows forms the windows forms app might catch exceptions and show a message box to the you might use the same library from a windows the service would be more likely to catch the log return an error to the original but keep running so it can process further the exception is like a contractual agreement between the caller and the the provider either do the job or tell you why i what you do from there is your own and the caller if you do the just tell me and decide what to do in that

the whole point of a primary key you have one row per you need to split this into a couple of one for visits and one for the visit table would have a foreign key relationship to the patient primary key need to think about what actual things you are and how they for each separate you would usually have a separate this allows the relationships that you are for you are representing a patient who has a during which there are a number of each of which has a corresponding plan this you should therefore have a patient table containing patient a visit containing visit and an examination table containing examination and maybe even a plan table containing plan visit table has a relationship with the patient table patient can visit a number of to achieve it should have a foreign key to the the examination table has a relationship with the visit it should have a foreign key to the visit primary are further ways that the can be as sascha look up

think a good idea to create a tparam with a variant variable a tobject something work but it seems very messy to pascal is not a dyanmically typed language and i try and treat it as i would suggest another function to handle so as well as having avalue avalue handle your data or create a record that defines your data for example instead of having tparam of variant and object have something so maybe you have so much different data that the route is the best but it seems like a bit of a maintenance headache when your other code gets passed an array of variant how do you know which variant is which and how to use each of them in your stored	
think a good idea to use dataavailable for this the end of your response is whatever your protocol says it better to use blocking calls like read to read your and use whatever protocol established to determine to read and how it might be that not all data you want is because read return when all your data is but when some data is so you need to check on how much was your protocol is likely want to respond to every single byte as with a terminal you want to echo it or process commands or what is perhaps suited to check if a read would block when called will return with whatever is in the but it makes your loop less van den

think nick has the right it sounds like you are performing your search and populating your listview in your onclick method for your search you need to perform your search preferably cache the data the first time and bind that to the listview for each new page that is requested using the can do this fairly easily by creating a method for the onpagepropertieschanged perform the search pull from the and bind the listview in that onpagepropertieschanged event and your data should your code might look like void eventargs void your void eventargs

think this is more a preference i am big fan of keeping things simple and for this reason i would suggest you break out your operations into separate stored will be more transparent and also aide any performance tuning you may have to do in if your update is performing you can immediately isolate it as the cause whereas if the logic is part of a much larger procedure with varying crud the root cause of the issue will not be quite so	
think this is one of the biggest reasons that dvd and bluray were cracked so i think the only way that they could really stop the average person from being able to digitally copy home movies is if they created a medium that licensed for use on and could only be used on certified would cut out the part of the market that wanted to watch movies on their computers and but would probably stop from having perfect digital rips for a little and would stop the average person from being able to do

think too early to say whether symbian going will be a good or bad thing for the the debate over the branding selected for the symbian foundation website shows a certain lack of clarity of the role symbian software will play in the true to say that there is an entire ecosystem that knows about the specifics of developing for symbian pretty meaningless in its own after still an active that knows how to develop cobol applications for ibm need to consider the size of the ecosystem and appreciate that that ecosystem is small given that symbian os has been around for over a decade and the software powers in excess of 100 million devices consider then the rate of growth of the ecosystems surrounding the offerings from google and apple symbian never generated that level of excitement and never saw that sort of growth in developer of a decade down the line and you could argue symbian have done the hardwork and created the landscape in which google and apple are now but just because symbian was make it best and give it any right to is true to state that the symbian idioms are a pain to it is incorrect to suggest that there is no justification for getting rid of the justification is the persistent 10 years that developing native code for symbian os is too most if not all these painful idioms were design decisions taken over a decade ago and whilst still beneficial on todays mobile devices are no longer mobile hardware has moved on substantially in the last symbian os has not fundamentally at least in terms of the developer consider now where pcs would be if the hardware had developed as it but the software stopped at windows or we almost certainly be able to have this discussion in quite this way for at alternative mobile consider android and both are linux based both use more developer standard development approaches which leave symbian os looking like come from another in itself is not necessarily a problem because as others have symbian os supports several runtime environments that make development for mobile devices that happen to run symbian os much more approachable for the average the runtime support to its natural the underlying os becomes a choice made by the device manufacturer based on time to quality but the end user care and in many cases know what the os developers then develop for their preferred rather than write native not at that conclusion still travelling the long therefore native code still plays an important part in mobile hence the ease with which developers can write for a given platform is important assuming the device manufacturers believe in supporting developer will open sourcing be good for difficult to see how open sourcing will be bad for but whether it will be good or not depends on the ability of the community to make symbian os into the os the community

think you want to use the indirect function to lookup the value of a rather than define a lookup range directly in the data have a look at which explains it fairly warned though that multiple cascading validations like this have particular problems of their if you make a second third then go back and edit the first there is no automatic flag to say that the selection may now be for if you have the then change the first you may now have a finding such inconsistencies can be very or requires some code to the ddoe blog shows one method to highlight such errors using conditional but this is very calculation intensive and scale aware that multiple lookups of this nature can bring a workbook to its knees if used even without using conditional in for a small project where data entry is tightly controlled this is a flexible method of cascading drop down but if you have little control over the or if the data collected will grow past a few hundreds lines then probably want to look at validating the validation using or just going the whole hog and forcing entry through a which is by far the best if the data absolutely has to stay the way it then an advanced filter which creates the named ranges used in the validation would be at this level of complexity though surely be better off just using a form for data

this a real program or rather a sample to illustrate a it is not clear why you would restrict access to the artists and albums rather than just to individual media items or even think that the joins should cost you that any db system will do them cheaply enough when you are making a fairly simple criteria match on multiple the problem with putting that much security logic into queries is that it limits your ability to handle more complex drm issues that are sure to bound for what if the album is a collection from multiple what if the album contains a track which is a duet and i only have access to one view is that in those a convenient programming model with sensible exception is much more important than the performance of individual which you could always cache or optimize in the what you are trying to do with queries sounds like premature your programming model as flexible as define a sensible sense of then work on implementing the database and optimize queries after profiling the real

this is but you could really do a lot to make your code more make a struct and then redefine its type to be a pointer to just asking for trouble when it comes to usually a bad idea to hide the fact that pointers are because when people see something like students return forces us to assume that returning a struct that was allocated on the which would be obviously not necessarily but a wasteful get even hairier when you add your of one as people assume that with no students is a full structure on the this will make anyone that sees do a double not obvious what while squishing assignments and comparisons into one if statement is perfectly valid c and usually not the most readable much newstudents p malloc if return people enjoy pointing out that casting the return value of malloc necessary in but it is in for your valgrind report your catstring but still pretty sketchy since hiding the memory using snprintf is a more idiomatic way to create the string you leak valgrind is it looks like just freeing the first node in your you need to traverse it and free them probably like p students next free p

to recap your you want to as much as trouble with the ie6 gc that bug has two collection occurs once every so many the more allocations you the oftener gc will more objects got the the more time each garbage collection run takes crawl through the entire list of objects to see which are marked as solution to cause 1 seems to keep the number of allocations assign new objects and strings as little as solution to cause 2 seems to keep the number of objects delete your strings and objects as soon as you need them and create them afresh when a certain these solutions are to keep the number of objects in memory low will entail more allocations and constantly reusing the same objects could mean keeping more objects in memory than strictly for your whether reset an object by creating a new or by deleting all its that will depend on what you want to do with it probably want to assign new properties to you do so then i suggest assigning the new properties and skip deleting or clearing sure that properties are either overwritten or the object be used but will be repopulated at some later then i suggest deleting it or assigning it and create a new one later no easy to use way to clear a jscript object for reuse as if it were a new object without creating a new which means the short answer to your question is like jthompson

typechecking arguments in python is not it is your code accepts either a string or a dict your design is comes from the fact that if you know already the type of an your own then doing something wrong hurts code reuse and reduces having a function different things depending on the type of the object passed is and has a behavior harder to understand and have the following saner make a function that converts dicts in unique lists of return your function assume the argument passed is always a that if you need to pass a string to the you just you need to pass it a you your best it is easy to understand and the code immediatelly understands what is and you make two one that accepts lists of strings and one that accepts you can make one call the other in the most convenient can create a list of strings and call any it is completely unnecessary and has only refactor your code instead in a way you need to only get benefits in doing both in short and long

understand iterators we first need to understand are specialist objects which provide one with the means to move through an ordered list of items one at a time same kind of thing is sometimes called a the framework provides two important interfaces relating to ienumerator and objects which implement ienumerator are themselves they support the following property which points to a position on the method which moves the current item one along the method which moves the current item to its initial position is before the first the other implement the introduced the which is when the object either directly or the compiler returns the be combined ingredient of block is the yield there is one big difference between do not implement the reset the reset method on point of iterators is to allow the easy implementation of where a method needs to return either an enumerator or an enumerable class for an ordered list of it is written so as to return each item in its correct order using the

use namespaces because people xeep wanting to use the same words to mean different things in their own private you can determine from context what a person in a personnel the xml is personnel in a vehicle registry the xml is vehicle registry keep a tag named but the tag means different things to each and contains different but what if you need or want to store xml from both in the same more what if both databases want to store xml chunks from some common database an accounts namespaces associates with each xml tag a such that the tag name itself has a url in front of part of the tag name actual xml documents use a shorthand do do by carefully choosing the its easy to be confident that the tag names wont collide as if the two location tags were named entirely so no as a the two entirely different location tags can include stuff from the accounts and explicitly state that they are talking about the same thing that makes all this useful is the you can start to write xpath expressions that say things find me any sections anywhere in this find me any items anywhere in this particular chunk of where the warning message is a child node of either a node or a xpath expression might be used somewhere in an xslt whose job it is to convert the xml into xhtml or for the why do because you can search the xml pull out all the accounts overdue messages wherever they confusing them with tags produced by other convert to and display them in bold red via a css without writing a scrap of procedural

was wondering how i should go about writing an xml data layer for a fairly simple php web the reasons for this server is not data schema that can be expressed in like the idea of having a self contained without server would possibly want to abstract it to a small framework for reuse in other schema resembles a simple book catalog with a few lookup tables plus it is quite simple to size of the main xml file is in the range of 100kb to but it could grow at some point to am actually considering extending my model classes to handle xml i fetch data with a combination of xmlreader and like function new xpath returns an return instead of loading the whole xml file in i create a simplexml object for each section and run an xpath query on that the function returns an array of simplexml for conservative search i would probably break on first found questions i have to ask you consider this as a viable even for a medium to large data there any to keep in when handling xml in the above code scale for large files inserts and updates in large xml files be handled in a low overhead you suggest an alternative data format as a better as a data layer for a php

way i share code between silverlight and normal is to use the as feature with so it ends up looking like vs works and both sets of code get the annoying part is where the silverlight framework line has some parts that exist in in that need to use the preprocessor to make the code target both has worked pretty well so this i can write test with but still have it work on sl from the same a few edit from the sl project this way the editor will limit to and you get surprises later you have to close the opened file for intellisense to update in the other

way we do it at my present company is to make sure is a not a web then you use names for the folders that would help identify it as the common ones that are distinct from the individual web instead of just your other web you create a virtual directory to the and add a file based reference to the requires you to use iis for development and visual studio believe that the controls really but it will work at and you can build just fine with only warnings about or path you do use common master pages and visual studio you will need sp1 for 2008 and use a in the root of the individual web projects to go in to design i saw this on another and i am going to look into doing more like	
way you worded your i believe considering the difference between an asmx an ashx and an ajax an actual aspx this is the they are all very the ajax pagemethods for all intents and identical to asmx they create an instance of the so they incur the overhead normally associated with aspx talking about saturating the server with probably find that all three perform

what i have understood there is a big difference between the included in the mvc release and the in the included in mvc my application i have many pages composed from many each having its own specific seemed to me more reasonable to use the method as each widget would have a dedicated controller responsible for getting different data and rendering a dedicated view opposed to having only one controller and a unique view model to pass to helper to render the tests i have done having a form that points to a create action method in a controller using new id calling it with render correcly with the same equivalent with using a action method on the controller to render the would not render correcly render that the action is this the correct way to use the helper and is it correct to use it in cases like renaming the partial view to renders the form

what i see the wpf gridview is just a view mode n for the listview with most things in advise you to do this with the viewmodel that means is that you have create a viewmodel object for each row in the the real model would be your datatable the view model is seeded with data from the real you create a new viewmodel instance from each row in your you then populate the grid with viewmodel view model exposes properties for each value you need to display in the actual so in this case your viewmodel would expose 3 properties each up your ui column to bind to the respective properties in the your would contain the logic of updating property2 with the right computed value on a both of them should trigger off propertychanged notifications and the gridview should reflect the updated values in both

will not talk about it is well known and talk about nginx vs second one is much more feature easier to configure and it has a way better when talking about deployment of fcgi or scgi application api django actually there are several important points that lighttpd provides support for spawning fcgi and scgi applications on its meaning it can fork and manage it for you if you scgi spawning use lighttpd when it comes to nginx you manage you application on your own use your own startup provides support of both sockets and unix domain sockets for both nginx and apache does not provide support of unix domain sockets for provides native support of cgi in nginx you should do a silly workarounds using regular expressions to provide that is not does not support cgi meaning that if you have a simple task to do that can be easily done with it is impossible for nginx to handle of fcgi for lighttpd is way simpler about nginx is indeed nice web but it my first is my little experience with development using various strongly recommend to use the problem was fixed in nginx there are still too many issues with nginx and for example which actually means that you deploy streaming comet methods behind development style of nginx is very patchy if there is some problem say a bug or missing feature reported it would not be ported to other modules like http or scgi and vise examples url decoding are general nginx development is very patchy and documentation is inconsistent you can find in some pages stuff this module is based on module the documentation there may be give yourself a favor use

working with the wpf datagrid from the wpftoolkit and having issues with trying to zoom the entire my initial thought was that it was going to be really easy and i would just apply a scale transform to the grid and animate the scaley properties when the used clicked a this did not work however because the scrollbar was zoomed in making it i need fixed headers and fixed columns on the datagrid so i simple use a scrollviewer outside of the datagrid to handle the the second thing i tried was to just scale the font size in the but this failed because on shrinking the font size the columns stay at the original width and do not i thought i had it working by using the below code which goes into the view tree for the datagrid and adds a scale transform to the scroll content not shown in this i apply a transform to the visual tree item for the headers in the same manner so that it scales as i thought this was working great until i tested out the horizontal scrolling after scrolling works before zooming at all the horizontal scrolling is but after when i scroll horzonitally the display freaks it is hard to tell exactly what it is but it sort of looks like the content that is scrolling off the left of the screen is and coming back in on the maybe it is just all smashing up on the left does anyone have any ideas how i can get this hopefully without throwing out my whole datagrid that is already working quite well scrollcontentpresenter sp st new a new new datagrid zoom

would add that ability to memory and performance trace is absolutely invaluable may also have a memory diff but i see a performance able to run a profiling session before and after a bug fix or then compare the results is incredibly especially with a mammoth legacy application in my where performance was never a priority and where finding bottlenecks could be very doing a diff allows you to see the in call count for each and the in duration for each is helpful not only during code but also if you have an application that uses a different for each if one customer complains of you can run a profiling session using their database and compare the results with a database to determine which operations are contributing to the of course there are many performance but sometimes i really helps to see the performance metrics from the application side closer to what the actually dottrace works and the diff is

would just use the mac address to generate a request then require users to register with your your client will have a special application that takes that request key and produces an activation key which the user can then use for activating the once the software just works no occasionally phoning home for verification and if it were a real my first task would be to try and convince the client that this was a bad reason is that these schemes practically prevent your code from being they do however make the lives of your genuine customers i find it hard to think of any other industry that goes out of its way to annoy its genuine customers with schemes that never achieve their goals than government of course you do just do a token effort to meet the contractual obligation tell your client this taking the mac address a random number the computer have a network as the request key and using a program to just it with an ascii string to get the activation seems like a workable i would also store both keys since you want the software to if they just change their network card even they still see that as the same computer and will not be happy if the software stops going to be cracked regardless the program is rubbish which sure is not the this method will give your genuine customers an avenue for moving their software to another machine if your company becomes unresponsive somehow goes out of and so main trouble with schemes that rely on the uniqueness of a bit of hardware is that the customer may choose to change that bit of their disk contents to a larger hard disk makes hd serial numbers cpu serial numbers means upgrading to the latest intel bigmutha cpu kill your the mac address means they change their can all be fixed by using those values to create a key at install time and only check against that not the changed value six months down the it means you have to store the request and activation values but upgrades will not require your users to go through the process of their believe they will despise you for having to do

would point out that dynamic languages can have their types implicitly defined by the the same as a static nice thing about dynamic languages is that you can write method stubs that call objects and methods that do not actually this can be nice for designing the code first and filling in the details good when you are working in worry if you do this the compiler will usually give you a warning that the method call probably the compiler will let you code and run that code languages are although the power can make them harder to debug at

you say my system floating point numbers are stored with a comma as the decimal assume you mean that they are with a floating point numbers are stored as you can tackle the formatting issue by setting cultures the fix is to change the not your code so maybe you want to do that on this but for general reference you need to ensure that when formatting floats or anything else you use the appropriate in the case of fomatting a number for use by an api you would use the use instead of and likewise when using just taken a look at the nerddinner code and have realised that this error is in the javascript not in so my code above going to i know if it is possible to format numbers in but the real solution i think is to fix the model code to return a correctly formatted suggest you try the the change the and in to class jsondinner public int dinnerid public string title public string latitude public string longitude public string description public int rsvpcount scroll down to the searchbylocation method and change the lines to format the strings correctly for should mean that you do not need the fix you put and should fix your other where i will leave a hope this i fully tested is as i am not in your but it certainly appears to

you were doing this for a create a you mention so obviously working with the apple allow iphone applications to dynamically link against other libraries at so your only option is to create a static a static library is linked into the application executable when my no static library project template in what likely have to do is start with a different iphone xcode template and add a static library hang on to the default application you can use that to build a simple test application to make sure the library actually actually use the library in an need two the compiled library has a and all the header in your finished link against your static and need to the header files so that the compiler understands what are available to common technique is to create one header file that imports all the that you only need to import a single file in your source for creating your own custom a simple tutorial here that should get you you can probably copy the default templates and just customize them to suit your struct syntax looks like struct cgfloat cgfloat are are declared in header so you can click on the name of a struct to see how little trick for creating structs is to do something like apoint the compiler knows the order of fields in the it can very easily match up the values you provide in the curly braces to the appropriate of more convenient to have a function like so you can write that like cgfloat return y that this is a not a so it lives outside of any or although i think the compiler complains if you define it in an is defined as known as an you can see the definition for that in the cocoa header difference between an inline function and a normal function is that the compiler can replace a to with a of which avoids the overhead of making a function a pretty minor but for a function that it makes
