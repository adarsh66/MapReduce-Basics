2009 code below tries to add a 257 length string to a compiles and runs but nothing is added to the like a compiler is because if the string was 256 get a compiler error and compile the way to make the app break when the developer tries to do something like know i could split the string and make this code but my point is to prevent developers for using this invalid code without silently cropping string

3 support it to generate straight c but the docs getting it to actually work are of does generate and it works with visual studio and i know this because done it before and submitted a patch to get it to work with is at a huge premium in our and even tiny leaks are i to be able to override the memory allocator to use our or at the very least i to give it a contiguous pool which it draws all its memory which i can deallocate en i can spare about for the parser executable whatever dynamic heap it allocates parsing has to get freed antlr3c last time i checked does not have a memory and uses the memory pool paradigm which you it does have one shortcoming in the api which the author refuses to which is that if you request the string of a it will create a new copy each time until you free the entire have no comment on the ease of using a custom but it does have a macro to define what malloc function to use in the entire for the executable my compilation was about 100 kb in size including a small suggestion to you is to keep learning because it still fits your requirements and you probably need to sacrifice a little more time before it will start working for

a and trying it on a webpage upon pressing a pops up a window which shows a cyclic with the images from the main from what tried googling around i can sense pretty but something is eluding know what follows results in two separate which merit two separate but i figure because both are related with the same maybe this belongs in a single so i hope the size of it enfuriate people too much a snapshot of what i think is the relevant var var var var var this for i hope i make any working with the debian i tried this with other in what happens popup show up as is supposed but it seems the cycle goes straight to the last seems to have no effect in between last picture is and the status bar shows its progress bar suggesting something is my questions exactly am i supposed to use the call tried to make it call an so it works as a in the cycle having the where the cycle updates the popup single image from the main images find if i load the popup by loading the html code from an external file the statusbar seems to show from the that the window keeps expecting a still going to try if from somewhere but what i want to know if it is that i load the html page from an external file with the versus loading an empty window and doing a writeln to it to the commented the in the because otherwise the browser stops responding and the computer goes to i could make an in the cycle to set the counter back to zero before the last but is there another or way to make this an infinite cycle or does the do just appretiate your comments in and if possible a pointer to existing bibliography describing similar popup with movie from images in main	
a bit like your original approach in basic idea is to print everything delayed by one line the hold and pattern spaces printing is that needs to be done because until we check whether the next line matches the regexp we know whether to a newline or there is just a trick to make the last line it appends the last line into the hold buffer so that the final implicit print command outputs it	
a bit more complicated than are actually two totally different versions of old managed extensions for was the only option available in visual available in newer compilers under the option kinda clumsy as it tries hard to integrate with standard so all new keywords lots of are prefixed with double code generated by this compiler is a mixture of native and msil dubbed ijw just new called is a clean new language available in visual 2005 and most it supports several modes of code option again generates a ijw mixture of native and msil results in a although it may translate native types into corresponding the code therefore may not be and can use pointer pretty much like with the strictest of options is which produces verifiable exactly like compiler does that differences between and see description of the compiler see the is called either msil intermediate or cil intermediate mil can stand for media integration the undocumented library used by wpf and vista desktop window	
a bit out on a limb but i guess because all the libraries that get added have to do quite a bit of setting up and there is no need to garbage so they simply get to waste even if all memory got it would wait until the first idle which is after the creation of the delete unneeded or force a garbage collect somewhere after loading the window from the nib and see how much it goes down if so am not concerned about some of the memory might be returned and the rest is the price you pay for a powerful

a critique since i believe in giving code for but you have at least tried which is better than most of the clowns posting homework need two one for storing cat one for or a way of telling the substring getting enough string can be both cat and you need to check them independently and update the right return statement should return true if catcount is equal to although your version would work if you stored the differences between cats and than be using string searches rather than checking position but that may be your next the method chosen is perfectly adequate for should be reasonably easy to get yours working if you address the points i gave one thing you may want to try is inserting debugging statements at important places in your code such sub count before the closing brace of the this is invaluable in figuring out what your code is doing my rot13 version if you run into too much trouble and want something to compare it but please use it without getting yours working that help you in the long almost certain that your educators are tracking stackoverflow to detect plagiarism so it even help you in the short that i really the more dumb coders in the employment the better it is for me obbyrna vag qvssrerapr sbe v v fgevat fho vs ryfr vs erghea qvssrerapr

am of the view that applications are so different from each other and our understanding of how applications should be written is sill very past windows forms applications i have worked on have been so different from each some of the design differences i have seen are most talk to database a backend that has been written for the given application a set of web services that were written for use by many applications and be changed for your being done by being done with the commands to backend of usages of no usages of data data being that work well in standard grid controls need custom controls for most of the ui developer teams of 10 or 20 developers on the of unit test using mocks etc no unit tests i think possible to create one implementation of mvc that always fits best posts i have seen really mvc and a mvc system is built the way it is the your own series by jeremy d after working though it you should be able to understand your options a lot smart client guidance microsoft composite application should also be it is a bit complex but can work well for applications that have a good a implementation for a winforms give an overview that is worth a lot of people like i have never used but will look at it the next time i need a mvc is a software development approach that combines the ideas of the model view presenter design pattern and it lets you start of by writing tests in the language i click the button the file should be saved and unsaved file warning have no experience using but will give it a try when i get a as it looks very stackoverflow questions you may may wish to look at and you are thinking of useing at any point take a look at the viewmodel here is a very good video you should take a look dolinger on view view design pattern for give another option that may make it easer to convert to wpf if every is yet another mvvm sample for winforms that also includes auto binding based on property ask yourself you are using you wish to be able to unit test as much code as you trying to allow as much code as possible to be you trying to make your code base easy to other reasons that can be valid for a given you are clear on your it becomes easier to choose an implementation or

am reading files in various formats and languages and i am currently using a small encoding library to take attempt to detect the proper encoding pretty but it still misses of my potential users have very little understanding of encoding best i can hope for is has something to do with and are very unlikely to be able to choose the right encoding in a so i would like to let them cycle through different encodings until the right one is found just by clicking on a click here to try a different the concept would be the best way to implement something like looks like i express myself clearly by through the i mean to loop through i meant was to let the user try different encodings in sequence without reloading the idea is more like say the file is loaded with the wrong some strange characters are the user would click a button or and the string would be converted in a different the user just need to keep clicking until the right encoding is encoding looks good for the user will do as long as the user can click he has a reasonable chance of solving his i have found so far involves converting the string to bytes using the current then converting the bytes to the next converting those bytes into then converting the char into a but i wonder if there an easier way to do if there was a method that would read a string and return it using a different something like a lot for the cycle through

an application bundle on os x can only be started however by simply copying the bundle the same application can be launched the best strategy to detect and stop this windows this effect can simply be achieved by the application creating a named resource at launch and then exit if the named resource be indicating that another process is running that has already created the same these resources are released in a reliable way on windows when the application problem i have seen when researching this is that the apis on os x keep state in the file system and thus makes the strategy used on windows lingering files after an improper exit can falsely indicate that the application is already apis i can use to achieve the same effect on os x carbon and to detect whether an os x application is already

answer your general question i would say the best way to handle database connections in java is to avoid the its ok for testing or learning about jdbc but not for real production if you have a data source that does not have its own jdbc driver but it has an odbc driver then you may not have a main reason why i suggest that you stay away from it though is that it makes it difficult to deploy your you have to set up the data source on the machine that you are running your application if you have access to the machine no but suppose you are sending the application off to the the pure java jdbc driver works better for this because it is included as part of your application so once your application is installed it is ready to connect to the data course depending on your requirements there are two other types of drivers but thats another

approach is a bad idea for a couple of but first some is an array of 0 which i even think is permitted for stack when declaring an array like this you must specify the maximum number of values you will ever is super if you do specify a number less and you use then you will cause a memory overwrite which at best crashes and at worst causes strange bugs that are a nightmare to track next problem is this i this line does is take the value stores in the address specified by and add what you want is to get the value at nth element of the address specified by like but you should take five minutes to think about a better way to do reasons i mentioned a bad idea need to iterate over the entire array anytime you require its can never store the terminating element this case in the i would suggest you maintain a separate value that stores the number of elements in the a very common way of doing this is to create a class that wraps this concept block of elements and the current standard library comes with a template class named which can be used for this not quite the same as an array must add items first before but very it also provides support for which is handy your program written to use instead of the function added something to print out the using namespace for i i cout cout return	
approach varies based on my familiarity with the system at typically i do something the if at all the fail state to determine the immediate cause of the familiar with the i may have a good guess about to root if i start to mechanically trace the data back through the software while challenging basic assumptions made by the the problem seems to have a consistent i may manually walk forward through the code with a debugger while challenging implicit assumptions that the code the root cause of where things can get this is where having a dump a broken can be truly think that the key point in my debugging process is challenging and the number of times found a bug in that component that i or a colleague would is working fine is been told by my more intuitive friends and colleagues that quite pedantic when they watch me debug or ask me to help them figure something

are a couple of different approaches and you could certainly use firstly you could remove some common code in to a separate project and just call that code this is pretty easy to do and i sometimes take this approach with simple helper functions that probably belong in a class in my main project a good example would be a math library or something like the other approach is to extract common functionality in to a class or interface which you then inherit and depending on what code you are looking to reuse you might use either of these suspect you will find it easier than you try it with some simple set up a new project in the same reference your library from your existing code and see how it there is also no reason not to reference your shared project in multiple solutions shared code libraries need not be a problem if the development gets handed for now you can have your 2 sites reference the same library which you but if and when you split the projects out to other teams you can give a copy of the shared code to each

are three types of standards behaviour you should be interested this will work on all complying use this as it depends on the implementation but at least still implementations are required to document what they do in these use this if you care about anything can and we mean up to and including your entire computer collapsing into a naked singularity and swallowing you and a large proportion of your never use make me come over more that 4 characters and a to a is undefined it matter why your program crashes with 14 characters but not almost certainly overwriting some information on the stack and your program will most likely produce incorrect results in the crash is better since at least it stops you relying on the possibly bad the size of the array to something more suitable in this case with the available or use some other data structure that can you seem so concerned with finding out why an extra 7 characters cause problems but 8 characters envisage the possible stack layout on entering i say since the actual layout depends on the calling convention that your compiler since the c code calls with and the stack at the start of after allocating space for a could look like c code return address argc argv x you write the bytes it overwrites the and on return from specifically populates populates and populates provided you actually try to after be if you write the extra to it overwrites the and one byte of the return address so when attempts to return to the c it goes off into fairy land this depends entirely on the calling convention of your possible a different compiler would always pad out arrays to a multiple of 4 bytes and the code fail there until you wrote another three even the same compiler may allocate variables on the stack frame differently to ensure alignment is what they mean by you going to

are undoubtedly better than just firing up phpmyadmin and changing the schema i did during my php but after using them for i think fatally control is a solved the main function of migrations is to keep a history of changes to your but storing a different file for each change is a clumsy way to track you create a new version of a file representing the when you want to add a new attribute why should you create a new migration when you want to add a new another just as you check into version why not check into version control and make the changes to the file is functionally the same as keeping a file for each but much easier to work my mental model is want table x to have such and such columns i want model x to have such and such why should you have to infer from this how to get there from the existing just open up and give table x the right even the idea that classes wrap tables is an implementation why i just open up and class you went with a model like have to make a decision about what to do with existing but even migrations are overkill when you migrate going to lose fidelity when you use a my question if you think of a better migrations kind of use database migrations instead of a version controlled

assignment operator is not required to be made discussion below is about but it also applies to any operator overloading that takes in the type in and any function that takes in the type in below discussion shows that the virtual keyword does not know about a inheritance in regards to finding a matching function in the final example it shows how to properly handle assignment when dealing with inherited functions know about signature needs to be the same for virtual to come into so even know in the following is made the call will never act as a virtual function in d because the parameters and return value of are function and are completely different and seen as 2 distinct virtual x return int d public virtual x y return int values and having 2 overloaded can though define a virtual function to allow you to set default values for d when it is assigned to variable of type this is even if your b variable is really a d stored into a reference of a you will not get the the below an assignment from 2 d objects stored inside 2 b the override is same b as d public virtual x y return virtual x return int char d b d b b2 return 99 99 shows that is never the virtual keyword on you would have the same results as above but the value of y would not be it would use the last step to tie it all can use rtti to properly handle virtual functions that take in your here is the last piece of the puzzle to figure out how to properly handle assignment when dealing with possibly inherited virtual const d x y x y return	
assignment the lvalue on the right hand side is not needed in some newer languages like the following in there is no need to practice is very common in programs to avoid accidental assignments that were meant to be return multiple return points was enforced mainly because you want to forget to delete your if you just use raii you need to worry about there are still good reasons to minimize multiple return and sometimes it is useful to have only most modern you do not separate your code into declaration and defines for multiple header file you used to often sometimes would lead to something like the following better way to do this if your compiler supports variable c you had to declare all variables at the top of your block of even later versions of c require this but people still do contains some unique notation can still be but i mean that kind of hungarian it was very important in c to have things ix you could have completely type unsafe functions if i would have called the string my program would have course the fix to this is to use only typesafe so as long as you do that you need hungarian notation in this still it is a good idea as discussed by joel in his

been reading up on linq lately to start implementing and a particular thing as to how it generates update queries that bothers the entities code automatically using sqlmetal or the object relational apparently all fields for all tables will get attribute which means that for every update and delete get sql statement like table set a where and and ad call me a but this seems extremely inefficient to and it feels like a bad idea even if it i know the fetch will be done by the clustered primary so not but sql still needs to check every field after that to make sure it in some very sensitive applications something like this can be but for the typical web app stack it seems like would be a more appropriate and personally prefer since linq will only update the actual fields that not all and in most real the second person editing something wins does mean that if two people manage to edit the same field of the same row in the small time between reading that row and firing the then the conflict that would be found be but in reality a very rare the one thing we may want to guard against when two people change the same thing be caught by because they click submit at the exact same time so there will be no conflict at the time the second datacontext reads and updates the record the datacontext is left open and stored in session when the page is or some other seriously bad idea like as rare as the case really like to not be getting exceptions in my code every now and then if this my first question am i wrong in believing for web not for banking i missing some reason why having as default is a sane second question can i change this is there a way to tell sqlmetal or the ord which updatecheck attribute to trying to avoid the situation where i have to remember to run a tool have to make take some regexes and edit all the attributes in the file because evident that at some point run sqlmetal after an update to the we run this and all our code will break in very subtle ways that we probably find while testing in stories are more than love to learn from other experiences on you very conflict setting updatecheck	
been teaching myself cell processor programming for the last couple of it is definitely not the best place to since successfully programming the cell requires mastering a lot of the various types of communication on the cell atomic to make this the documentation for the cell can be hard to and if you use a more common platform there will be a much larger community of that is not to say that there any community of users for the just that it is and even though there are other environments where one might find it can be difficult to translate techniques for these environments to the due to its unique using a standard ps3 with linux allow you to access the graphics not all learning the will teach you a lot about programming close to the you really have any as there are not very many abstractions available to the each spu on the cell has 256kb of local memory and if you need more than then you will need to figure out some sort of scheme to issue the correct dma requests to bring the right values into memory at the right time and keep the spu busy doing something while that dma request is in learning the maybe not the best platform for but given that you have the opportunity to take classes from this sounds like a good any if you are the from is a great and has a couple of chapters about game programming on the cell with the ogre which might also be interesting to

calling a method through a null pointer or reference is strictly speaking undefined but it may succeed unless the call is virtual methods virtually a not from the derived class with way of always fails if the is null because virtual calls require access to vtable and accessing the vtable through a null is so you call an empty virtual method through a understand this you need to know more about how code is for every method a section of code segment containing the machine code implementing the a call is done from a derived class or a method through a the compiler knows exactly which method to call so it just inserts a call to an exact portion of code and passes pointer as the first parameter in case of calling through null pointer will be null but you care if your method is a call is done virtually a the compiler know which exactly method to it only knows that a table of virtual methods and the address of the table is stored in the in order to find what method to call necessary to first dereference the get to the get the address of method from it and only then call the reading the table is done in not during if the is null you get segmentation fault at this also explains why virtual calls be the compiler simply has no idea what code to inline when looking at the source during

could bet that the compiler is not going to honor your say that you have a local and that you recursively call the function 100 if it were to honor all your auto variables keyword it would require 100 hardware registers just for that variable the variables are alive at the 100th is a difficult analyze where is the program really spending time and try to optimize but be some decisions can end in no some can end up in worse as it has been mentioned compilers are really good at what they forcing a variable into a register means one less register for the rest of the variables to

couple of source not for the it matter what you we tend to spin up an subversion account for each client so they have a place to log bugs as but the critical first step is getting the full source tree of your site into version when changes are made on the testing server or staging you see if they you then you update on the live rollbacks and deployment gets a lot for clusters of multiple webheads you can repeat the or rsync from a single you use you can also use cvs checkouts of drupal and other and the metadata will be able to live beside each other bulky folders like the files use a symlink in the location to point to a directory outside of the that lets your source control repo include all the code and a instead of all the code and all the files users have are cleaning up the db and pushing it to live is easiest for the initial rollout but there are a few wrinkles when doing incremental db updates if users on the live site are also generating did a presentation on deployment best last feel free to check the slides

creating your own it makes sense to start them on first use and then let them hang around for a while in case you need them again you make an idle thread wait on an event so you can reactivate it by signaling the and after a long enough time the thread will wake itself and reclaiming the unused by keeping a small number of idle threads ready to be you reduce the overhead of constantly creating and destroying threads is significant for sufficiently this is basically what the thread queue already does for you so you may as well use a solved similar debate used to happen in the community about believe it or should we each write our own string or should we use the answer depends on whether you want to learn how to write a string or done with that and you want to get on with inventing something

enables us to also configure file thus besides iis also invokes when requests have the following file extension is used to request user user controls be accessed how and why would anyone send a request to a user this extension is used for http but why would you want to request an page directly instead of registering this handler inside configuration file and enable it to be called when files with certain non ashx extensions are since there can be several http handlers how will know which handler to invoke if they all use ashx what does the requested ashx file perhaps a definition of a http handler i know how we register http handlers to be invoked when pages are but how do we register http handler for ashx this extension is used to request a global application why would we ever want to call i assume that when request is made for an object derived from httpapplication class is except this time no web page processing takes besides being able to request for is there any other reason why i would choose to request file with extension ashx files have to be they are basically a simpler for when you need the entire page life a common use is for retrieving dynamic images from a if i write a http i should put it in a file with extension and will build an httphandler object similarly to how it builds a page instance from if a hacker did try to make a request for one of these what would you want to you certainly want iis to treat it like a text file and send the source for your app down to the could do the same it does with file it registers these file types with iis so that it can explicitly prevent users from accessing these because you expect requests from the browser for a it mean you want that resource handled by the these extensions are also how picks up files to compile for the web site model then why also allow files to be directly and as far as i am these are not exposed to process any external book claims the two are mapped in appreciate your the extention is defined in a config file just not the its in the use the difference is that the class that handles a reads the page directive in the file to map the request to a class specified in that this saves you from having to put an explicit path in the for every handler that you which could result in a very long thought http handler class was defined inside but instead file with extension only contains page not sure if i understand this say we have ten http handlers we want to invoke by making a request to i assume for each http handler there will be specific file thus if request is made for then handler specified inside that file will be another must confess that still a bit unsure about ashx realize that by using it we can for example create where page directive will tell which class http to invoke when request is made for thus no need to register http handler in if you use http handlers that then they will only get invoked when requests are made for files with if i want http handler to be invoked for files with other such as then i will still need to register http handler in file mappings

for a design pattern when dealing with threads is the really best approach to start too bad that many people try instead attempting to implement less or more complex multithreaded constructs on their would probably agree with all opinions posted so in recommend to use some existing more providing building blocks rather than simple facilities like or for it would be simply the which gives you classes you can easily combine to achieve a multithreaded the big advantage of this is that you avoid writing which results in and in favor of a much clearer my it seems that most concurrency problems can be solved in java by using this of you always should be careful with challenging

from of inner grouping of if a class is useful to only one other class then it is logical to embed it in that class and keep the two nesting such makes their package more consider two classes a and b where b needs access to members of a that would otherwise be declared by hiding class b within class a members can be declared private and b can access in addition b itself can be hidden from the outside maintainable nesting small classes within classes places the code closer to where it is main advantage is anything that can be accomplished with inner classes be accomplished without

general way to prevent nodes in a graph is to mark nodes as you pass and then ignore nodes that are this terribly practical if you want to modify the graph you are scanning so you need a way to mark the nodes the easiest way i can think of to do this under linux would be to store a the for each directory you then when you look at a first check that you already seen any directories with the same this not only handles but also trees that merge back into each get the number take a look at the functions and the and members of the stat storing the probably wanting to look at a or a binary

get into the trap of optimizing without proper as others have suggested use a profiler before making any different data structures that you have enumerated have different a list is very efficient at inserting elements in the beginning and at the end but suffers a lot when accessing random an array has fixed storage but provides fast random finally an arraylist improves the interface to an array by allowing it to normally the data structure to be used should be dictated by how the data stored will be access or memory you seem to be mixing some an array will only give you a continuous chunk of memory for the type of data that you forget that java has a fixed data float and object include all even an array is an it means that if you declare an array of string strings or myobject myobjects you only get a 1000 memory boxes big enough to store the location or of the you get a 1000 memory boxes big enough to fit the size of the forget that your objects are first created with this is when the memory allocation is done and later a reference memory is stored in the the object get copied into the array only

good info to change of file versions and assembly versions need not coincide with each i recommend that file versions change with each change assembly versions with each build just so that you can tell the difference between two versions of the same use the file version for deciding when to change assembly versions takes some discussion of the types of builds to shipping and builds i recommend keeping assembly versions the same between shipping this avoids assembly loading problems due to version some people prefer using publisher policy to redirect new assembly versions for each i recommend against that for it avoid all of the loading for if a partner your they may not know to install publisher your app will be broken for even though it works just fine on your if there are cases where different applications on the same machine need to bind to different versions of your i recommend giving those builds different assembly versions so that the correct one for each app can be used without having to use builds for whether a good idea to change that version for shipping it depends on how you want the binding to work for do you want these builds to be or are there many changes between the two are they going to break some do you care that it breaks them do you want to force users to use your important if you should consider incrementing the assembly then consider that doing that too many times can litter the disk with outdated you change your assembly versions change hardcoded versions to the new i recommend setting a variable to the version in a header file and replacing the hardcoding in sources with the run a during the build to put in the correct i recommend changing versions right after not right so that more time to catch bugs due to the

guys have a string that looks something like the following with this string i need to be able to do the test end result should be the exact order of the tokens is not that wondering if anyone has any smart ideas of how to go about i was thinking a regex replace on each of the tokens on right and if a replace occur because there was not match just append but maybe there is better the right side should override the the left being what was originally there and the right side being the new another way of looking at is that you only keep the tokens on the left if they exist on the right and you keep all the tokens on the for the the problem is the efficiency with which the solution you i was initially thinking down similar lines but discounted it due to the complexity of the merge n and z is the number tokens on the left and right let alone the splitting and why i was trying to look down the path of a maybe behind the regex is just as bad or but having a regex which removes any token from the left string that exists on the right for the total amount of token on the and then just add the 2 string together vat test test1 seems more thanks token

have investigated this internally and found the following you can add the webviewer to a view there is no need for the complicated interaction code in your just add the webviewer to your aspx view in our sample the webviewer was added as is enough to get the webviewer working on the the controller we specified an activereport as new the codebehind of the view we hook the report to the as the tricky part there are some ihttphandlers used by activereports when running under for some of the viewer types such as acrobatreader to ensure our handlers are working you must get mvc routing to allow them to process as luckily it is easy to do just add the following line of code to the new allarcachitems will ignore the note that according to my reading there may be problems since routing seems to allow only a single route like if you have multiple of these ignoreroute commands and or you have any problems with a need to modify the constraints dictionary argument to accomidate the as well as more information see the following can download the full sample from our forums at dynamics

have previously worked in the game and did something along these to my no one ever bothered cracking the score submitting way it was done was a random number as a salt the score using math based on the salt a checksum to make sure there was no tempering on the score the score and any required data to the score submitting the validate that the score has not been tempered using the the score is then insert it into the reject you you might log ip adresses of the submitters of scores violating the checksums a policy of three bad and add a script to ban them from accessing the server for but this will probably not be required unless someone wants to crack your code that the hashing checksuming was made using a custom did not need something very it was made using a computation on the salt and the some simple math operations like multiplications and a simple algorithm maths for the say your user has a score of generate a random number as a salt of pad with should use something a bit more complex but it is just an our the crypted score would be for the lets say you want to have a value of as a add all the numbers of your crypted score you calculate the value of your checksum for this of crypted score numbers we have the following salt crypted score checksum make a request to the sending as a score you can divide by giving and validate the checksum using the same function as the checksum then numbers have been could probably end up with something much more but it should do the

i have two one manages the client is only one client and one call it my server two manages sending messages to the i call it my message processor one is among other things sending a heartbeat to the client programming i made an assumption that the sockets thread but the buffers and as long as i was using seperate buffers for the server and processor threads i would be also made the assumption that the was analogous to the socket buffer in these assumptions i wrote this function to send a void a printwriter try printwriter new catch other the one does something similar in that it this manner i would create a new every time i wished to send a and my messages would never get this does not seem to be the and i get an message coming through the pipe like causes a core dump are my sockets are obviously not thread but are the printwriters i get from them thread or is it just returning the same what is analogous to the socket buffer in how should i think about this how do i make it so that these threads do not write to the same buffer on the a java printwriter thread

i think i reproduced roughly what your describing and i deleted my original answer cause it was way i found is that when you want a content page to reference a user control being used in a master page and the control is accesible and what you will get an error indicating that you need to reference a specific and then you get errors indicating that no method exists of type such and adding the register page directive on the child page to the user control resolved this i reproduced this even with the control defined in the or on the in both cases i still had to explicitly add a register on the content make sense to me but it allowed my code to compile and give it a shot let me you do this you can reference the control assumes that you have a public property called messagebox on the master also found that this works much better if you register the control on both the master and the content page and not use the you want your child page to reference the user control your other option is expose methods on the master page like which would delegate to the user	
i think it fits to your application but there has to be a clear distinction between the people and tasks functions to make it scott has a point that it might be somewhat in contrast to what microsoft intended to use the ribbon it think the ribbon also fits to this kind of if you wanted to have a conventional tab like michael suggests you would need buttons to switch between the windows or by using the ribbon you directly link the controlling with the making it easier to learn what buttons are linked to what buttons that are used for the whole app can be integrated into the office button large office logo in the top left which is actually exactly what microsoft are currently implementing a toolbar as so probably not entirely however i tend to think the ribbon works quite simple and enables users to easily discover one this could also be achieved by using large and dropdown just easy that most ribbon packages available have these things so no need to code it yourself you can very

is a typical define a data structure that encapsulates all the data your thread in the main instantiate a copy of the data structure on the heap using operator fill in the data cast the pointer to pass the to the thread procedure by whatever means you are provided by your thread when the worker thread gets the it it to the data and then takes ownership of the meaning when the thread is done with the the thread deallocates as opposed to the main thread deallocating is example code you can compile test in struct handle dword winapi data return tell the main thread that we are up do your work return must use allocation here so that we can transfer of this threaddata object to the worker in other the function will own deallocate this resource when done with threaddata data new kick off the new passing the thread dword id handle thread wait for the worker thread to get up in real you need to check the return value from wfso and handle it here i assume the retval is indicating that the event has become wait for the thread to return

is correct on some other reasons are that it cost effective and that there are additional security have different hardware requirements than database database servers fare better with a lot of memory and a really fast disk array while web servers only require enough memory to cache files and frequent db requests on your regarding cost the two servers necessarily be less however ratio should be higher since you have to different applications competing for for this probably going to have to spend a lot more for one server which caters to both and offers equivalent performance to 2 specialized security concern is that if the single machine is both webserver and database are with two you have some breathing room as the 2nd server will still be secure a while at there are some scalability benefits since you may only have to maintain a few database servers that are used by a bunch of different web this way you have less work to do applying upgrades or patches and doing performance i believe that there are server management tools for making these tasks easier though the single machine the the

it safe to assume that your application controls both the sending and the receiving of these pointers that the pointer be picked up by code that you the then i suggest you pass pointers at keep the pointers in a hash or linked list associated with the script and pass an integer index into that data may feel like a high overhead the overhead is likely to be much lower than the overhead of using scripting within your so it probably will not be i see that you included the idea of using a missed the first time because tucked after the code but even for 1000s of this is not likely to be your performance

java but is relevant to most other technologies as not sure whether confused the use of a plain singleton with a both of them are design the service locator pattern is used by applications to ensure that there is a single class entrusted with the responsibility of obtaining and providing access to jms service locators are implemented as since there is no need for multiple service locators to do the same it is useful to cache information obtained from the first lookup that can be later used by other clients of the service the the argument about to ensure that there is only one active connection to your false and it is quite possible that the connection can be if left inactive for quite a long period of so caching a connection to the database is frowned there is one deviation from this the connection obtained from the connection pool is encouraged as long as you do so with the same within the same http or user request is this done from the point of view of since establishing new connections can prove to be an expensive

just like to say this is pretty this is but uses the smallest possible amount of a sliding your top top bottom bottom you still need to the extra attributes of background for browser top top bottom bottom you get rid of one of the size constraints width or you can drop two make a sliding either technique you can optimise your image by creating a gif or png with enough transparency between the segments to exceed the maximum bounds of width and height your button will one for each this would allow you to only require two images instead of a bit of thought you could probably figure out how to merge both states into a single image using or based background this would allow you to simplify the

justifications to do with new platforms are usually to do with five support through and how well proven something with existing key systems and open platforms tend to mop the floor with the first three but that does depend on a staff cheap but if already got little concern from open source is a little more sketchy but still the key difference is that ms owns the entire aspnet from through to support is centralised that mean good your linux server software blows you might be able to get support from your main but they might push you out to the no judgement on the quality of the but a slightly more intricate is the silliest of the django is well how you use it that tested or of course there are using svn releases of django will probably result in the occasional the biggest issue and blocker for migrating is existing aspnet sites run on linux but you can deploy django on if you have key infrastructure to move you might have to stage even deploy django on iis for a until you can chuck windows out the standards are something relative new to management basically not finding yourself locked in five years down the of course the linux platform is great on that front but it is important to note that with any orm mapper the biz that manages your there is a certain lack of you can still access the data from other places but need to concentrate on might work almost no support short and really a subjective how much of a pain migrating is really depends on your existing if you have no existing setup to migrate things are if you have the technical wager most people would swing towards a more open a personal i moved to ubuntu before i dropped i tried to keep it going through vmware but eventually decided i needed something was before the aspnet mvc framework was and eventually landed with think go back out of even to an improved aspnet django is just cleaner my humblest of freelance so i can mostly suggest what frameworks to this has been great for learning django but if you find yourself working for one you might find this if looking for going to find a damned lot fewer jobs for django than you will i doubt ever reverse but there django work out

kloc should be small enough to insert generics with a big obviously make sure your code compiles an runs on java se 5 the relatively easy thing about generics is that adding them makes very little change to semantics overloadings can change because of implicit cases as a bad example off the top of my cases adding generics will highlight conceptual problems with the using one as two maps with disjoint key for is an example in the java library where a single class has two distinct mode or like and are very local and can be added enums are rarer and might take some thinking about how you are actually going to use

know the difference between smalldatetime and right now i am using smalldatetime because the precision is good enough for my but the problem is that i still need to keep inserted items in order and smalldatetime is mixing things up if the inserts come too close to each it an acceptable practice to use both a smalldatetime and a timestamp i would use the smalldatetime to know when the item was inserted and the timestamp field to order things i do not consider using datetime a valid solution since it will have the same problem with keeping things ordered if the inserts are made fast way to keep track of an ordered smalldatetime

languages are typically built around the concept of hence it makes more sense for language features to reflect including this behavior can be confusing at times but part of the problem and advantage to having state in your think the best proof of this argument is to look at some of the more recently languages which have closure both and imperative oo chose to have mutable while a functional has immutable closures deriving from the idea that is immutable by what would it actually mean to have an immutable closure in an imperative most people think of this as making the variables equivalent to sure value types would be protected from but what about mutable reference you be able to change where the variable pointed but you could call a mutating function and get a similar for student public string name var student new name del could be implemented with an immutable closure as i actually modify where the variables point however i am clearly still doing a mutating

little bit comment is accurate in that there is a little less bookkeeping to be but the emphasis is on rather than the material matched by has to be kept so that you can use the appropriate to refer to it in the the notation means that does not have to keep track of the match so it is doing a little less do you mean by track of the how does it affect can use escaped parentheses to parts of the matched for suppose playing with simple c function declarations no pointers to functions or other sources of parentheses then we might have a substitute command such as the an input line such char double output will int char double c might you want to do imagining that i need to wrap the c function so that it can be called from a language compiled to c that uses a different interface convention it is based on informix to be using it to get an example not because you really need to know why it was a good change to in the the and in the replacement text refer to the captured parts of the regular expression the function name sequence of alphanumerics starting with an alphabetic character counting underscore as and the function argument list between the but not including the used the notation around the function then would refer to the argument list and there would be no because would not have to keep track of one of the two captured parts of the regular it has marginally less bookkeeping to do than if it had to keep track of two captured as i the difference is you could probably never measure it in why the manual says allows more if you needed to group parts of your regular expression but need to refer to them then you could work with longer regular by the time you have more than 9 remembered parts to the regular your brain is usually doing gyrations and your fingers will make mistakes anyway so the effort is not usually worth but that i the argument for using the it matches the perl notation for a regular

looking for tips on the best way to reconfigure the log4net logging level dynamically in my i generally use a simple configuration where the root logger defines the default logging etc there may be several each with filters to define the logging levels they first thing like to be able to do would be to allow administrators to connect to an admin page that enables them to view the current level for the root logger and dynamically change i want to use and write to the configuration file on disk because i want these changes to persist when the application is like to go and on an admin page be able to display a treeview with all current loggers that exist in the and their current logging and allow the administrator to be able to change the logging level selectively at any level of the idea is to to create a generic admin page that i can put into all my apps that allows administrators to selectively enable logging dynamically for troubleshooting find the log4net apis a bit can anyone point to samples or show the best way to achieve answers are equally good so accepted the first to i can get all current loggers as log in logger parent level effectivelevel null is the effective level same as level if the latter is not otherwise inherited from the least one of the loggers returned above will have the root logger as which enables me to get a reference to the root the above it should be possible to reconstruct the logger implemented an server control that displays the logger hierarchy in a treeview with and allows the user to dynamically change the logging level at any node in the works great and be putting it on admin page in all my web and web service reconfigure

me coder for i have i put some code into a dll in the and now i am confused about how the gac is really working with our intranet environment i have several related web applications each application runs from a separate and potentially runs in its own app for now all of the apps are on the same but that is not this setup allows us to develop and migrate each app there are several parts of each app that we wanted to be common across all of our applications logon menus the request from management was that changes to these files could be and would take effect without having to and each web there are lots of ways to accomplish this and despite warnings to avoid the this really seemed like a case where using a virtual path provider and a dll stored in the gac made put together a virtual path and then embedded the files and resources i needed to be common into a could have had the vpp pull the files from a but i was hoping that embedding the files into the dll itself would be more want the developers of each app to have to mess with their own gac to test and run their so in each solution i just included the virtual path provider and made its result copy well as strongly this means that the provider along with its embedded files are copied to the bin directory of the as long as the developer have a version of this dll in their gac they the local bin copy is this allows the developer to easily change and test both the files and the files that are common to every also means that unless it is deliberately the common dll will exist in the bin directory of every app in production as since iis will always use the gac version if it even if the local version is out of the gac version is always accepted this as reasonable for now since i find an easy way to both have the copy local for and yet not copy to the bin when the app was copied to the coding an app so that it always uses the latest version of the dll instead of the specific version that it was compiled with seems like a fairly complicated i have yet to see a good example of how to do but i think i would need a chain of publisher it seemed much easier to try the more obvious answer leave the version number of the dll unchanged when migrating a new version of the vpp dll to the this seemed to work until it the windows on the i replaced an older version of of my dll in the gac with an updated copy of even though i had updated the dll in the my apps continued to use the old version of the restarting and even rebooting the server entirely did not seem to what really flipped me out was that eventually iis would mysteriously and unexpectedly correct itself and start using the correct copy of the dll from the have seen many gac related questions of this type that all seemed to end with of the sudden my website started working correctly it took a while for me to see that this was an effect of how iis was caching my strongly named and that i was the way strongly named were supposed to i tried removing the version of the dll from the gac because there was still a copy of my dll in the bin i expected that the process would either or to the version that was in the bin however because the version in the bin was also iis continued to use the cached copy of the which now no longer existed on the had me really baffled for a because i lost confidence that the gac version was ever running at the only way i had to assuredly get the dll to update was to remove the copy of the dll from the remove the copy of the dll from the bin run the site so that it would and then put the new version of the dll into the starting and stopping iis during this had no this consistently got my applications to use the new code much for simply sticking a new version of a dll into the gac and having its new effects propagate reading some related what i am trying now thesoftware of the dll in the gac still leaving the version number new dll at everything in the folder i think a but of a appears to be but it still seems like there is something wrong with having to go to all this is there an easier way to force iis to use the current instance of the is there a better way to accomplish the effect that i am common files and files shared among various that can be updated separately from the apps based on a comment from shahkalpesh i found this page at microsoft included this tiny tidbit of assembly redirect one version to use the the oldversion attribute can specify either a single or a of for specifies that the runtime should use version instead of the assembly versions between and means that along with my i could push a single publisher policy file that redirected everything to the that sort of mitigates what i thought would be a nightmare chain of where i had to maintain a link from every possible version to the will try this and see if updating the version like this also triggers iis to use the correct version of the new file resetting the app a dll in the gac that contains aspx pages for a web

new to and development on but hopefully i can frame this question in an understandable way regardless want to parse an xml feed for my iphone and i decided instead of shoving all of the delegation methods from an instance of nsxmlparser into my view wrap this up inside of a feedparser after reading a few docs and example what i came up feedparserdelegate feedparser nsobject id id delegates of my feedparser object just have to implement as i started actually making my class use i realized that i have to specify that implements a protocol for i could just implement the delegate methods that i wanted to do something i think noticed this with other classes that follow the delegate but not why i too just not bother with specifying a formal protocol for my it would cut away some perhaps unnecessary i guess the question why would i to create a formal protocol instead of just doing something like just checking to see if the method is implemented on the delegate with is it only so that the compiler will issue nice warnings if a required delegate method i have to specify a protocol if i want my class to have a

nhibernate can generate your mapping files based on simple no and strongly recently worked on a where we needed to change from linq to sql to nhibernate for performance especially way of materializing the objects seems slower than ditto and the change management is quite slow and it can be hard to turn the change management off for specific scenarios where it is not you are going to use your entities disconnected from the datacontext in wcf scenarios for example may have a lot of trouble connecting them to the datacontext again for updating the i have had no problems with that with thing i will miss from l2s is mostly the code generation that keeps relations on both ends of the but i guess there are some tools for nhibernate to do that out there	
nightly build process was broken for a long such that it generated pdb files that were a few hours different in age than the corresponding image i have since fixed the i would like to start using a symbol but cannot due to having to use these pdb i work around this issue by using the method in that means i have to organize all my pdb files by and after years upon years of that adds am looking for a way to modify the mechanism that windbg uses to mark a and force it to match my image the utility does something but for pdb the developer states on the page is capable of making an executable and pdb file match if they have different signatures but the same age this article for more information about pdb signature and if the age the tool cannot make the files took a look inside a and even found what looked like the bits corresponding to the but it must pull some more tricks cause i get it to know if this but in my particular case the age difference was caused by unnecessarily relinking which would recreate the pdb files as our build process was storing the original dlls the and the pdb after the i thought about somehow recreating such a situation by forcing a relink on a but saving off the pdb in both then i could do a binary compare of the two files to see how they perhaps run some sort of patching software that does this by seeing what exactly changed in my control perhaps i could do the same to the dlls and pdbs saved in my companies build figured it thanks to one of the comments on the first i checked out a link to the pdfs of the book windows 2000 a programmers and the author goes into great detail about the pdb file as i said i had already loaded the pdb into a hex editor and flipped some bits around appearing that i made the but it after using the utility from the w2k secrets book to the pdb into the included i found out that they hide another reference to the age in stream once i flipped that one as it matched up in this is thank you so server here i can you change an pdb to match

not sure if anybody has spelled it out exactly this but you need to understand the is no element in a as others have sets have no a set is a mathematical concept that specifically does not include your computer really keep a list of stuff not ordered in it has to have some internally an array or a linked list or but you really know what it and it really have a first the element that comes out comes out that way by and might not be first next even if you took steps to a particular first still coming out by because you just happened to get it right for one particular implementation of a a different implementation might not work that way with what you in you may not know the implementation using as well as you think you run into this with rdbms systems and an rdbms query returns a set of this is the same type of set from an unordered collection of only in this case the items are an rdbms query result has no guaranteed order at all unless you use the order by but all the time people assume it does and then trip themselves up some day when the shape of their data or code changes slightly and triggers the query optimizer to work a different way and suddenly the results come out in the order they these are typically the people who pay attention in database class when reading the documentation or when it was explained to up that query results do not have a guaranteed

noticed this in a server when making a lot of tiny objects that quickly get thrown the garbage collector keep the problem is more pronounced when the tiny objects have pointers to larger objects an object that points to a large the gc seem to realize that if it frees up the tiny it can then free the larger even when calling this was still a huge problem in and we ended up doing and what i recommend to you is to maintain a pool of when your object is no longer throw it into the when you need a new grab one from the pool or allocate a new one if the pool is this will also save a small amount of time over pure allocation because java have to clear the worried about the pool getting too large thus wasting you can either remove an arbitrary number of objects from the pool on a regular or use weak references using one of the advantages of using a pool is that you can track the allocation frequency and and you can adjust things using pools of and and we maintain separate of sizes in the pool we always allocate arrays of size that are powers of our product does a lot of string and using pools showed significant performance in the gc does a fine we just noticed that with small objects that point to larger the gc seem to clean up the objects fast enough especially when the vm is under cpu is just a hint to help schedule the finalizer thread to do more calling it too frequently causes a significant performance

of i would say that the problem you described pertains not only to rmi but to any kind of interface of a including plain java although in case of rmi a bad design may have additional knowing the i can only guess by looking at my such an unnecessary complexity of an interface is often related to invalid or insufficient business requirements defined for the if the in future the guys at the other division will probably have to frequently modify the trying to catch up with new which is usually a cause of pain for the users of the although changes of the interface are of course natural over in this case they may result in a deep an overly complex interface usually means that the author exposes implementation needless to this can lead to unnecessary interface changes due to the evolution of the switching to a different or even optimization but not giving the users more than they need is a straight way to letting them use functionalities not even intended to be or even in it may turn out that the users invoke the interface in an unexpected it makes the maintenance of the component a wrap it the key arguments for a simple interface clear business definition of a improved flexibility of the and all those profits are good for both the component developers and the

of much gratitude to for their very informative blog post scrolling in tweetie with the post explains in detail how the developers were able to squeeze as much scrolling performance as possible out of the uitableviews in with the source code linked from the blog post github a uitableview using these custom cells to switch to edit exposing the ui for deleting an item from the the text aside as the deletion control slides in from the this is although the text jumps back and forth without animation to the text movement in goal 2 above for a smooth user this is the step where i became is the best way to introduce this animation to complete goal it would be nice if this could be done in a manner that keeps the logic from my because i would love the option to move the conflicting part of the view while any portions as stay in the same place or move a different number of if the above is not possible then undoing my last commit and replacing it with an option that slides the entire view to the right would be a workable solution appreciate any help anyone can from quick pointers and ideas all the way to code snippets or github of course you are welcome to fork if you would i will be staying involved with this question to make sure any successful resolution is committed to github and fully documented thanks very much for your have been thinking about this a lot since my first post and realized that moving some text items relative to others in the view could undo some of the original performance goals solved in the original blog so at this point i am thinking a solution where the entire single subview is animated to its new postion may be the best if it is done in this way there may be an instance where the subview has a custom color or gradient hopefully this can be done in a way that in its normal position the background extends unseen off to the left enough so that when the view is slid to the right the custom background is still visible across the entire uitableviewcell when entering edit	
of my projects on linux uses blocking things happen very serially so would just make things more i am finding that often a recv call is returning with errno set to man page only really mentions this happening for which makes with the socket may or may not be available so you might need to try would cause it to happen for a blocking can i do anything to avoid the my code to deal with it looks something like this have it throw an exception on but beyond that it is a very simple wrapper around ret flags errno throw this even the eagain condition gets hit pretty some things which noticed which may be do set a read timeout on the socket using but it is set to 30 the happen way more often than once every 30 my debugging was happen as often as i thought they perhaps it is the timeout i want to be able to have connect so i temporarily set the socket to that code looks like error socket sock set the socket as nonblocking int flags fcntl flags we but it will return if return else if goto timeval we until returns its result or timeout errno return len if return else return we change the socket options back to blocking return idea is that i set it to attempt a connect and select on the socket so i can enforce a both the set and restore fcntl calls return so the socket should end up in blocking mode again when this function socket returns

on reading your previous i think you mean to say that you want a binary encoded rather than a is used to refer specifically to data that has been reduced in size through the application of an algorithm such as lzw in your you may find that the output is in the sense that it is smaller because for a wide variety of numbers a binary representation is more efficient than an ascii but this is not in the standard which may be why you are having trouble getting the answer you are looking think you are really asking the a number in ascii format in a for how can i write this to a file as a binary encoding are two parts to the you must convert the ascii encoded string to an integer you may use a function such as which will return a long integer equivalent in value to your ascii encoded do be aware that there are limitations on the magnitude of the number that may be represented in a long so if your numbers are very you may need to be more creative in translating you must write the data to the output stream using which does not attempt to format the bytes you give if you simply use the default stream operation to write the find that your numbers just get translated back to ascii and written out that put this all together like for for for for char char use strtol to convert to an here means the string is in as opposed hexadecimal or long intvalue convert the value to not strictly but it is good note that if you do you will have to convert back to with when you read the data netvalue create an output make sure to open the file in binary write out the data using not

only way to make the initial compilation of the query faster that i know of is to make the query less the msdn documentation on considerations for the entity and indicate that there is any way to save a compiled query for use in a different application execution would add that we have found that having lots of includes can make query execution slower than having fewer includes and doing more loads on related entities some trial and error is required to find the right i have to ask if you really need every property of every entity you are including it seems to me that there is a large number of different entity types in this so materializing them could well be quite if you are just trying to get tabular results which you intend to projecting the fewer number of fields that you actually need into a anonymous type should be significantly faster for various this frees you from having to worry about eager calling can certainly speed up the initial view generation by precompiling the entity there is on msdn for but since you pay that cost at the time the first query is your test with a simple query shows that this is running in the neighborhood of 2 seconds for nice to say that 2 but it save anything

posted looks fine from a although i could be it would appear that any other code that does some using the foo should be i see any in the that section of few things worth noting anyway from being very careful with deadlocks and testing rigourously to insure they best to put a lock around the code within the as i believe in certain circumstances that methods can be called before the constructor block has finished please correct me if wrong on this object in this case is which is if it were protected or internal you would certainly have to be cautious about how other code utilised the object fact i think it would be best to almost declare such objects as done locking the right always safest to lock on a separate private instance object because you that object be locked by any other code than your own the case if you lock or the object i may be missing and there is a small possibility that some other code not shown above might cause but as far as i can see it that code flawed except for a missing lock around the constructor more likely to have to watch out for deadlock situations when you start doing more complex especially across hope that

put it the other way you might be risking overcomplicating something that is ridiculously simple being a bit as others are pointing is really just a minimal set of language extensions to when you are writing you are actually writing you can even access the internal machinations of the runtime support using some handy c functions that are part of the language i recommend you actually do this unless you really know what the only time ever had mildly tricky moments is when i wanted to pass an instance method as a callback to a c for using a cross platform library that has functions which accept a i might call the function from within an object instance to process some and then want that c function to call my instance back when its or as part of getting additional input etc etc common paradigm in this can be done with funky function and some other creative methods and if you ever need to do it googling method for c or something like that will give you the only other word of advice is to make sure your objects appropriately manage any manually memory that they create for use by c want your classes to tidy up that memory on dealloc it is than dust off any reference on c and have

real advantage of the fully normalized version in the first answer comes when the requirements change when someone changes the specs so you have to add types beyond the 3 those changes do normalized structure should let you do that more without needing to change either table structure or most of the programs that use the the normalized structure does require more investment in the beginning every new transaction involves inserting into 2 you need to have a check constraint to control the do better in the long term with the normalized with a simple case lik you can sometimes get away without normalizing and not have to pay the consequences nobody has to pay until long gone and somebody reasonable levels of normalization should be your standard strategy and you should require yourself to have very good reasons for	
really a hard and fast rule for this type of thing most experiments like to use at least 200 members in a population at the barest scaling up to millions or the number of generations is usually in the 100 to in to answer your final better to have lots of members in the population so that genes stay in a population long enough to and then use a smaller number of these the important most critical part of any ga is the fitness if you have a decent fitness function that accurately evaluates what you consider to be a level or a not going to end up with interesting results no matter how many generations you or how big your population is

short answer solving this in the app layer is the wrong ext4 must make sure that after i close the the data is written in a timely as it is ext4 this writing to be able to collect more write requests and burst them out in one problem is no matter what you you be sure that your data ends on the calling manually only makes things you basically get in the way of slowing the whole system ext4 has all the information necessary to make an educated guess when it is necessary to write data out to the in this i rename the temp file to the name of an existing for this means that it must either postpone the rename the data of the original file stays intact after a or it must flush at since it postpone the rename next process might want to see the new renaming implicitly means to flush and that flush must happen on the fs not the app might create a virtual copy of the filesystem which contains the changes while the disk is not modified but this affect the ultimate an app know what optimizations the fs if going to make and the fs must make sure that it does its is a case where ruthless optimizations have gone too far and ruined the golden optimization must never change the end if you maintain you must not long as tso believes that it is more important to have a fast fs rather than one which behaves i suggest not to upgrade to ext4 and close all bug reports about this is as designed by some more thoughts on you could use a database instead of the ignore the resource waste for a can anyone guarantee that the which the database become corrupted by a the database can write the data and call every minute or but you could do the do sync sleep 60 the bug in the fs prevents this from working in every people be so bothered by this could use a background config daemon like the windows the daemon would write all configs in one big it could call after writing everything problem solved for your now you need to do the same for everything else your apps text i mean almost any unix process creates a this is the freaking basis of the whole unix this is not a viable so the answer there is no solution on your keep bothering tso and the other fs developers until they fix their

someone said they had 2 years of experience in but understand the ins and outs of constructors destructors and it would not prevent me from hiring this is the type of knowledge that can be easily learned and consists of a few simple would certainly like them to have that knowledge but not having it does not make them a bad or lazy worked with excellent programmers that spent the majority of their time in old school com and hresult this makes heavy use of but virtually eliminates there is no need or reason for them to have learned once we introduced exceptions into the code it took about 15 minutes to get everyone on board with the constructor destructor would much rather use an interview to test a persons problem solving skills than to see if they knew the ins and outs of a particular part of it is so easy to teach but so hard to teach problem	
someone who is fairly new to iphone been trying to find good design patterns for managing multiple specifically where the subviews need the same type of delegate methods to be i have a view where i need to swap between 2 uitableviews based on user both uitableviews need a uitableviewcontrollerdelegate object defined to populate the you more experienced iphone devs find that overloading the main view controller as the delegate for both subviews is the right way to do currently i have 2 objects defined that each act as a delegate for each uitableview to try to keep things more it accomplishes what i need it but is this a good pattern to would assume there are some best practices out there to avoid various pitfalls with memory management and fun things like thanks in the best way to organize multiple

special would you would write at some place in the middle of the allocated memory bytes apart from the 99 bytes before the end of the allocated you would free that allocated the compiler will handle it exactly as we would the memory allocated by that is completely unrelated to null terminated you could stick everything you want into that some chunk of you could even create some arbitrary object into that memory bug is somewhere for some common error is this where the constructor is called but the destructor is called a p p new delete return int a a what happens is that the default constructor is called and the created object is copied zero or more but the destructor is run for each copy you will call the destructor on the pointer more than leading to such strange the correct way to fix is to use a smart like as an you can also do it by writing proper copy constructors that copy the object over and allocate memory in the copy so that the copy and the respective original object keep distinct

surprised at how many people suggest that the os can do a better job at figuring out your caching needs than you can in this specialized while i do this for i did do it for similar processes and i ended up using a ramdisk with scripts that automated the this i think go with a modern source control at every compile it would check in the source code an experimental branch if automatically so that every compile would result in the data being saved start start the ramdisk and pull the current base do the etc all the while the edits are being saved for the final check in when and you even have to involve your regular there are background synchronizers that will automate things the issue is that they be optimized for programming and may need to do full directory and file scans occasionally to catch a source code control system is design for exactly this so it would likely be lower overhead even though it exists in your build in mind that a background sync in the case of a power is you would end up having to figure out what was saved and what saved if things went with a defined save point each or forced by have a pretty good idea that it was at least in a state where you thought you could compile use a vcs and you can easily compare it to the previous code and see what changes applied

terms of memory these two classes are virtually several other responders have suggested that there is a difference between the two in that one is allocating storage on the stack and other on the but not necessarily and even in the cases where it is terribly in all different is where the for the is the actual underlying storage in the is allocated from the heap a little bit tricky to see this because using so the specific implementation details are but is implemented like vector if int int t you can the class itself only has a few members size and a pointer to a dynamically allocated block of memory that will store the actual contents of the your the only difference is where the storage for those few fields comes in the first the storage is allocated from whatever storage you use for your containing class if it is heap so too will be those few bits of the if your container is stack so too will be those few bits of the the second those bits of the are always heap both the actual of the the contents of it are allocated from the and you cannot change else has pointed out already that you have a memory leak in your second and that is also make sure to delete the vector in the destructor of your container

the answer is probably a combination of 1 and can take advantage of a lot of the tools and features that the framework provides for you by writing a or provider if the default options quite go as far as done just that on a number of client sites for example one of our clients has most of their users stored as commerce server and use the commerce server profile so we wrote a membership and profile provider to talk to those datastores a fairly simple people are probably going for 3 because of the need to authenticate over raw tcp this introduces a layer beyond that of the standard membership of what ms produce is or but there will always be edge cases where you want to do something quite that mean you end up rolling your i guess to have something beyond or that was simple for your average developer to they took the sensible option of just build this for the you take a look at the numerous ways you can authenticate against a wcf see what i mean these designed to handle different transport and are therefore much more the default roles and profile providers are fairly limited no so you need to check for each possible or explicitly assign each role to the all stored in one field as comma seperated values not easy to find all users got a value	
the answer to your question is probably there are lots of reasons to avoid throwing exceptions whenever but memory really a real reason to only throw exceptions for truly exceptional conditions is that generating an exception involves carefully examining the not a fast operation at if doing it as part of your regularly flow of it will noticeably affect your i once wrote a logging system that i thought was extremely clever because it automatically figured out which class had invoked it by generating an exception and examining the stack in that eventually i had to go back and take that part out because it was noticeably slowing everything else

thing you can do is you need to do it to go from to and you need it to go from to any reference to an so you can call methods even without if you do less you let the compiler do more work for you and catch things that stated goal is to be able to check that the thing getting out of your list really is an adding as an implemented interface would allow you to achieve that goal in that your major for not doing that hold any want to be able to compare references for no com requires that if you call twice with the same guid on the same you get the same interface pointer both if you have two arbitrary interface and you them both to then the results will have the same pointer value if and only if they are backed by the same you seem to want your list to only contain and you have delphi 2009 where a generic would be you can discipline yourself to always explicitly add values to the never values of any descendant whenever you add an item to the use code like as any duplicates in the list are easy to and your are assured to actually solve the but it given the rule the object explicitly implements all its you can check for things like and if added items to the list like i described safe to disable the enabling the assertion lets you detect when someone has changed code elsewhere in your program to add an item to the list running your unit tests frequently will let you detect the problem very soon after the above points in you can check that anything that was added to the list was added correctly with this and i recall whether the compiler accepts comparing an value to an iunknown value if compiler then simply change the declaration iunknown the supports function the assertion then either you added something to the list that support at or the specific interface reference you added for some object cannot serve as the if the assertion then you know that will give you a valid that the value added to the list to be an value given your type declarations this is a safe because the interfaces implemented by form an inheritance tree that degenerates to a simple there are no branches where two interfaces inherit from each other but have a common if there were decendants of and implemented them the above code be valid because the reference held in necessarily be the reference for that the assertion would detect that and need to add it with as you disable the cost of getting the types right is paid only while adding to the not while reading from the i named the variable to discourage you from using that variable elsewhere in the there only to support the and it have a valid value once assertions are

think idea of storing the schema table names in a table will your view gets created in that schema by using an inner join of that schema table to syscolumns to create the you might want to consider using dds instead of sql to create a logical file over syscolumns for each not sure how many libraries you are dealing with but if they are just a few this might be use dds with is already a view so to create a dds lf for you have to create it over the underlying qadbifld physical file is also involved but i think you need any fields from that file for this a r qdbifld a s dbilb2 a s dbilfi could use dbilib dbifil if schema and table names are 10 or if you need the syscolumn names you have to do some field wrong as you could also do this with a sql create view select from where and use a table myschema varchar mytable varchar into mytableselect view select from where and ordering is being done on either the dds or the

think of it this way the username is the way of figuring out which account a user is trying to login the password is the way of figuring out whether the user is actually allowed to login as that in this means going to look up a row in your accounts table using the username as an by encrypting the simply making it harder to find the right if using the same encryption scheme to encrypt the username and they are pretty much equally secure if you can break you can break the encrypting both makes it harder to lookup the but add any additional in your question you talk about decrypting your password you probably want to make this impossible most people encrypt their passwords using a hash function of some sort and sha256 are along with a the part simply means that once you run something through the you use what you get out to get what you started if you start with the same always get the same the salt is a secret that only your application knows of like an encryption which is added to whatever you are before it is run through the this makes it impossible to do things like match two encrypted passwords from two different sites using different	
think saving images in system folders is the best with db and queries you know will cause some overloads and db transanctions usually are heavy and it can place more stress on your the way u save images in folders and just put urls in db it is more suitable for your app the advantage of db is that you can backup your save your images in the only need is to know about system

think that test driven programming is the before actually implementing the you first create a unit test it a then gradually implement the functionality and make sure the contract is still valid as you usually i start with plain stubs and then gradually fill out the rest replacing the stabs with real keep improving and making the test at the end you end up with a robust implementation of said module plus got a fantastic test bed coded implementation of the later if someone modifies the first you see if it can still fit the test if it the contract is broken reject the the contract is fix the unit and so boring cycle of software development

think the best way to achieve this is to rely on the fact that according to the ieee 754 floating point the integer representation of floating point bits are lexicographically ordered as a you could simply add one ulp in the last to get the next floating point representation will always be slightly larger than your treshold if it was since the round error is at most float floatvalue floatvalue int asint asint floatvalue floatvalue my know when you need to add one have to rely on the difference of and a rounded if int asint asint floatvalue correctly convert to but leave that the float gets promoted to a double via the multiplication with before the is you do this you risk getting in the situation that in float representation would be

think the premature optimization quote is used by too many to avoid thinking about the hard stuff concerning how well the application will i guarantee the users want you to think about how to design it so it will run as fast as is not to say you should be timing but the design phase is the easiest place to optimize and not cost lots of time are often several ways to do you should pick in the design phase the one which is most likely to perform the best it turns out to be one of the times when it the then optimize this should trump the need to have easy to read you considering performance in the design you going to have a well designed that mean it should be the only concern in a database rate it as 3rd in right after data integrity and but trying to fix a system where poorly performing techniques were used throughout because the developers thought they were easier to understand is a being a user of such a system where you have to wait for minutes everytime you want to move from one screen to another is a nightmare reallly should spend all day everyday for at least a using their for everyone who is stuck with the badly designed it costs less to design properly than to fix later and considering performance is critical to designing work somewhere where the orginal developers drank the koolaid about premature optimization and did everything the way they thought was simplest which in almost every case was the wrong choice from a performance now we are at 10 times the size we were three years ago and every screen on every website takes 30 seconds or so to load worse times and we are losing customers because of but changing it will be too hard because at the base they designed the database without considering how it would perform and redesigning a database with many many gigabytes of data into a new structure is way too time consuming and if it had been designed to perform from the start it would be both easier to maintain and faster for the we talking about the need to performance tune the top 10 slowest queries we are talking about the fact that the overall structure requires a drastic change that would affect virtually every query against the to perform do micro optimization until you nmeed but please do the macro consider if is this the best way before you commit to the write cursors to hit tables with millions of records when a statement will try to have as few tables as possible becasue that seems to be a more elegant solution when the tables are storing disparate items as and causing every single query to hit the same table and causing every delete to check all sorts of foreign key tables that will not ever have a record for that type of entity takes minutes to delete one record from the main table in our a real joy when something goes wrong in an import data from a client and we have to delete let me tell

think there is a best if you have the time to code up menus and high score tables in opengl the you have a lot more flexibility you could for example have a 3d animation going on in the you code high score using standard uikit views and switch out the opengl view while they are shown then this has the advantage that very quick to code if you took the time to learn to use interface but it is inherently even though you can still use custom button graphics and fonts to make it look less like a business still going to look less polished compared to other games in the app you want to do is to layer a transparent uiview over the top of you opengl view this will be very personally use interface builder generated views to get stuff like menus in while building the rest of the the intention is to replace that with opengl animated code in the end really down to how much time you have

think you answered your question writing it down problem can be seen in this from one hand you have time you have fresh data and from them nice to create view to show time as time goes there are more data and logic so good to have written down summaries of data you had some time very pragmatic you do not duplicate because you recalculate them and save into new table summary of when you think of it in this obvious that in this example new table will be as you have more complicated archive data unchanged when logic when you meet this of this criteria as you requirement than its not choice you go into i would use view is only when showing fresh data out of other fresh in very simple and when it gets more complicated you always switch to new do not be afraid to go into having one summary table with faster access is very pretty solution and a sign of well formed care of the design of this table so when business logic changes you do not need to change everything from one stone in this and then everything will be

to a single you only grant connect to a the user can connect but has no other you have to grant usage on namespaces and select on tables and views individually like connect on database mydb to this assumes actually connected to usage on schema public to select on mytable to the latest versions of you can grant permissions on all in the schema using a single command rather than having to either type them one by select on all tables in schema public to only affects tables that have already been more you can automatically have roles assigned to new in default privileges in schema grant select on tables to that by default this will only affect objects created by the user that issued this although it can also be set on any role that the issuing user is a member you pick up default privileges for all roles a member of when creating new so still some faffing if you adopt the approach that a database has an owning and schema changes are performed as that owning then you should assign default privileges to that owning imho this is all a bit confusing and you may need to experiment to come up with a functional versions before avoid errors in it is recommended to use the following process to generate the required to each select on relname to join on nspname and relkind in should output the relevant grant commands to grant select on all and sequences in for this will only be applied to tables that have already been

was gonna make this a but it got too seems to have hit on an important though not strongly enough in my are lots of criteria you might use to describe will it be used in a long running app or winforms app or is it a server or client library or standalone etc to me that if your code will run in a standalone app and you have control over all the surrounding then you can roll your own thread start your own and measure and manage the cost around thread thread and resource or you could use the but it kill your app either you are free to the other hand if your code is packaged as a library that may be used in a server or maybe in a sql clr or a wcf service then it is a really bad idea to create you need to use or some other mechanism that exploits the thread pool if it is to be used in apps with other once quwi is imagine that every library wanting to take advantage of computers rolled their own there would be complete chaos in apps that used more than a few rampant all competing for the same no central coordination of vs hygeine that a whether it is to be consumed in client apps or server uses the common and that means thing to realize is managed thread is either a background thread or a foreground background threads are identical to foreground threads with one a background thread does not keep the managed execution environment once all foreground threads have been stopped in a managed process the file is a managed the system stops all background threads and shuts that belong to the managed thread pool threads whose isthreadpoolthread property is are background all threads that enter the managed execution environment from unmanaged code are marked as background all threads generated by creating and starting a new thread object are by default foreground you use a thread to monitor an such as a socket set its isbackground property to true so that the thread does not prevent your process from the

way that springs to my mind is to use a generation number for the give the todo table a column called generation and associate with it a global and persistent generation number best to put this in a table in the time an update or insert is made the generation number is incremented and put into the generation number column for the updated or inserted the records are first read from the db and put on the web page the current generation number is also retrieved and cached locally put into a javascript subsequent ajax driven reads use a where clause which filter only records with a generation number greater than the locally cached generation this ensures only new updates and deletes are the locally cached generation number is then are a bit more one way to do it is to tombstone deleted records for a limited say 21 you have bit column called tombstone and a datetime when a record is deleted the column has generation number set in the same way as for an insert or the tombstone bit is and the datetime is set to the current time using the ajax request can then select records with the tombstone flag set and remove them from the client side if the client is coded so that after every 20 mins a full page or an ajax call that gets each and every is enforced then a db job can run every minute and clean up the tombstoned records older than 20 you actually need to separately persist the generation you can the sql function max over the generation

would discourage you from trying the problem is that in order to make regions guaranteed to be you need a very sophisticated type sure looked at the papers by tofte and talpin and you have an idea of the complexities even if you do get regions working the chances are very hight that your program will require a whose lifetime is the lifetime of the that region at least has to be garbage is why cyclone has regions just getting encourage you to go with garbage modern garbage collectors can be made pretty fast without a lot of the main issue is to allocate from contiguous free space so that allocation is it helps to be targeting amd64 or other machine with spare registers so you can use a hardware register as the allocation are lots of good ideas to one of the easiest to implement is a collector like joel where the idea is you allocate only from completely empty you want to study existing garbage has a fairly sophisticated incremental garbage collector there are no visible pause and the implementation is only 700 it is fast enough to be used in a lot of where performance

would seem to be the sort of thing for which a hashtable would be storage and retrieval of hashtable entries is possible in and can be used quite effectively i would recommend trying something like the following a is effectively a generic available from this will be used to keep track of the occurrences of each keywords value will act as a bit each text file and read all the setting the appropiate bit for the corresponding text file in which the keyword is would vary from 0 to 3 in your over all entries in the looking for the appropiate value in your because you are looking for a keyword that appears in the files but the last the value you want to search for is 0011 3 in find this entry and you have your this algorithm runs in where n is the total number of keywords in all your text i think going to get better than that let me know if you need a few more i seemed to have missed the bit about your possibly containing more than one actual if these are known to be shorted than a certain number of then i think this solution may still be viable with small need something a bit more it would

would suggest for turbogears they have done a fantastic job of integrating best of python assuming you are developing moderately complex business solutions in tg2 or some other framework say even though these frameworks supports wsgi does that mean one who is using these frameworks have to learn in most cases answer is i mean good have this knowledge no knowledge is probably is more useful in cases want to use some middleware or some other component which is not provided as part of the standard stack for authkit with tg or without are doing some is good but think of handling your database at the end of exposing validations in such cases django like frameworks do it all for

writing a simulation of a slow and say the clock speed is a constant 1 i assume this means that 1 instruction be processed every some instructions take longer than adding 1 0 takes less time than 1 latter causes a ripple of carry bits which takes a amount of need to be able to carry out instructions only after all other instructions have i need how long the longest instruction takes and set the clock speed to greater than a stateful watcher that allow future a instruction to be executed until the previous is i misunderstanding the problem it seems like still risking a race condition of instruction being incomplete before the next in it seems like risking an clock speed which could cause me issues can i resolve are there any hints in how a real processor handles this timing issues in a

you cannot use lambda expressions in the watch locals immediate as marc has pointed out this is incredibly i wanted to dive a bit further into the topic most people consider with executing an anonymous function in the debugger is that it does not occur in a the very act of definining and running an anonymous function changes the underlying structure of the code changing the in and in particular from the immediate is a very difficult the following var v1 var v2 func1 var v3 v1 particular code creates a single closure to capture the value closure capture is required whenever an anonymous function uses a variable declared outside for all intents and purposes v1 no longer exists in this the last line actually looks more like the v3 the function example is run in the debugger it will stop at the break now imagine if the user typed the following into the watch order to properly execute this the debugger more appropriatel the would need to create a closure for variable this is difficult but not impossible to really makes this a tough job for the ee though is that last how should that line now be for all intents and purposes the anonymous function deleted the v2 variable and replaced it with so the last line of code really now needs to v3 to actually get this effect in code requires the ee to change the last line of code which is actually an enc while this specific example is a good portion of the scenarios are even worse is executing that lambda expression be creating a new it should actually be appending data to the original at this point you run straight on into the limitations small example unfortunately only scratches the surface of the problems we run i keep saying write a full blog post on this subject and hopefully have time this

you compare a float and an but the problem you will run into is on most float and int have the same size and wildly different precision neither type can hold all values of the other since one type cannot be converted to the other type without loss of precision and the types cannot be native doing a comparison without considering another type will result in precision loss in some you can do to avoid precision loss is to convert both types to a type which has enough precision to represent all values of float and on double will do just so the following usually does a f i

you could do something like not as easy as implementing an interface on your but it also means you need to tie your class implementation to your choice of di container by inheriting from a di container specific interface not sure how much of an issue that is in believe that constructor injection is far more commonly used right and property injection is widely seen as a fallback for cases where it is not feasible to get the di container to perform object construction for you i could be wrong there just my view on the you really think that property injection up code and tests quite a interesting because i sort of think the opposite i think constructor injection is and guessing that could be simply because how i normally do it so what used
