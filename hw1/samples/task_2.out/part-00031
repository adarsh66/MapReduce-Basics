3 million records is way too much to handle at my guess is that you are performing an export or something like that which requires that many records to be sent down the one method you could use to reduce this issue would be to have the generate an export and then deliver that file to the client compressing first using zlib or something you are pulling data back to the client for viewing then consider sending summary information and then allowing the client to dig thier way thru the data a portion at a the users would thank you because your performance will go way up and they have to dig thru records they care about looking records is way too much to handle at if you had that many would you be able to carry them but if you made it into larger you if your sending data to the client for a then i strongly suggest a summary give them the large picture and let them drill slowly into the send grouped data and then let them open up this is a search results then set a limit of the number of records to be returned for example to display 100 set the limit to still only display the last record means that there were more than 100 records so the customer needs to adjust thier search criteria to return a smaller

a bit confused about how many controllers i and when i can load in uiviews into the same versus having two controllers for two separate my current i have a simple app that takes in information on the beginning and then based on the info from the user a uipicker and a it displays a flip animation to a new view that is one of two viewa or i have a root controller that gets loaded into the uiwindow after then in in the viewdidload i create an instance of another controller and insertsubview into which at this self is the original instance of takes in the does some logic on the user entries and then loads either an instance of viewacontroller or viewbcontroller and viewbcontroller are very but just have a uiview that looks slightly the user interactions with the screen will be the feel like and getinfocontroller should be the but not sure how to integrate do i load getinfocontroller directly into the do i need to do anything in viewdidload i have one viewxcontroller instead of one for viewa and how do i load different uiviews into the one based on the logic in and how to architect a simple

a compiler is a little different from testing some other kinds of because ok for the compiler to produce different versions of a program as long as they all do the right if just testing an pretty much the same as any other here is a will want to build up a test each test should code you will say input to the program you will say you expect the interpreter to produce on standard say you expect the interpreter to produce on standard say care about standard error because you want to test your error will need a script that does something like the fail echo differences on diff exit brainfuck cmp fail cmp fail will find it helpful to have a script that does something run this only when totally confident that the interpreter works for that keep your test suite under source convenient to embellish your test script so you can leave out files that are expected to be time anything you all the you probably also them all nightly via a cron you want to add enough tests to get good of your source the quality of coverage tools varies but is an adequate coverage luck with your if you want to see a lovingly crafted but not very well documented testing go look at the directory for the

a system developing i have a choice of either using a single stored procedure that does three related jobs and returns either no or the same result but sourced from two different read an article yesterday that suggested that a should only have one execution plan and that any procedure that changes execution plan depending on a difference in parameters should probably be written as multiple the procedure as three different procedures would change how the system that executes the procedures operates but not in any significant like to know is whether the performance gained from having procedures that have different execution plans depending on inputs vs a single procedure is worth the effort is the overhead of calling the database three times greater than the overhead of having to recompile the performance plan depending on server individual procedures single

add a little to and your difference between a resource is that the garbage collector is aware of managed resources and aware of unmanaged i know that answer very concrete but the difference is help draw the line in the sand here is the short probably riddled with little version of how gc runs and cleans up garbage collector is aware of all managed objects but when garbage collection runs it initially know if any given object is still in use or is elegible to be it determines whether or not it can cleanup an object by initially marking all objects as then traversing from the application root to all referenced each object that has a relationship back to the root either direct or gets marked as reachable and is no longer considered after the gc runs through every reachable object it cleans up the rest since they are no longer in almost all cases working with framework objects you can be assured that objects are managed provides managed wrappers of nearly all unmanaged resources to ensure they are properly cleaned other third party components which hook into the win32 api your components which do are the objects which may be cause for are some objects which can be considered to be somewhat components of the graphics library are one memory really memory leaks in the true typically they occur when you you have removed an object from use but in fact the object still has some reference to the a common example is adding eventhandlers onsomeevent addhandler addressof and not removing are technically not memory leaks since your application is still technically using however if there are enough of them your application can suffer severe performance impacts and may show signs of resource issues unable to attain window an intermediate developer and unfortunately know about these problems i recommend playing with ants profiler to help become familiar with lingering references is a free trial or if you want to get a little bit more research using windbg and to look at the managed if you decide to look into the latter i recommend reading tess she has a lot of great tutorials and advice on using windbg

agree with the trigger although i would use a join to inserted instead of a i want to point out that username is a particularly poor choice for a primary usernames often change and when they do you need to change all related it is far better to have a user id as the key and then put a unique index on then when the user name you need to change anything	
algorithm applies more to weighted paths and it sounds like the poster was wanting to find all not just the this build a graph application sounds like it need to be and use your favorite search it sounds like you want all not just a guess at the shortest so use a simple recursive algorithm of your only problem with this is if the graph can be the looking for a path from you could have a cycle of 1 2 3 that then keep a stack as traversing the a list with the steps for that graph and the resulting stack for the formatting no table next nodes minus where we came duplicate number on the stack cycle to node three and popped 1 off the no more nodes to explore from to node 2 and popped 1 off the target node found record stack for a no more nodes to explore from to node 2 and popped 4 off the no more nodes to explore from to node 1 and popped 2 off the duplicate number on the stack cycle to node 2 and popped 1 off the target node found record stack for a no more nodes to explore from to node 2 and popped 4 off the no more to node 3 and popped 2 off the no more to node 1 and popped 3 off the no more with 2 recorded paths of and

am assuming that you are dealing with hierarchical data just need two one of the tables is for the categories and relationships between the for categoryname computers programming games python other table is for storing the data associated with the for itemid 1 book programming in 1 world of first table contains a foreign key column that links the subcategories to their parent this is known as the list this model has the advantage of being simple to understand and doing various things retrieving the path to the python category with this model can be done quite easily with code you mind the performance cost because you may need to make multiple queries to the it can be mindboggling if you try to do it in full for retrieving the path for a category will require way of structuring this table is to think of the categories and as sets and subsets as the set hard to explain this model without and the article hierarchical data in seems to do a better job in explaining the concepts and

am designing an and like to ask a few questions about how best to secure access to the the api is allowing access to artists have that have users of the api have access to a subset of all the if a user calls the api asking for some it is easy to check if the user is allowed to do if the user asks for an the api has to check if the album belongs to an artist that the user is allowed to accessing songs means that the api has to check the album and then the artist before access can be database i am looking at an increasing number of joins between tables for each additional layer that is i want to do all those and i also want to store the user id everywhere in order to limit the number of work around i came up with the following api gives the user a reference to an for instance an artist the user can then ask that artist object for the which returns a list the list object can be and album objects can be obtained from from an album object a songlist object can be obtained and from the individual song the api trusts the artist it also trusts any objects in this that the user gets from without further and so forth for all the other so i am delegating the to objects down the would like to ask you what you think of good or bad about and of how you would solve this how would you approach this if the api should be my approach seems less applicable in that do i secure data access in my new	
am designing this hr system for a the thing is i have all the tables designed and was planning on using the in vs2008 to generate the entity classes is the first time i work with in this is my first i wanted to make the app with 3 layers of the programmers of the company suggested not 3 but 4 or 5 but after reading quite a lot of blog entries and a lot of questions here realized that is not quite easy to do that with linq to sql because of how the datacontext works and how difficult it is to pass objects between layers using linq to just use the entity classes generated by the vs2008 orm and add any validation and bussines logic in partial that would be 2 or the app will be used by like 10 so i think the 2 layer approach is a big issue for the a will be developed so candidates can apply to jobs i want to develop it as scalable as but the truth is i have a lot of time to waste to make a times running up said all should i just use the entities generated by the vs2008 any suggestion or idea would be greatly to sql orm	
am developing an application which involves multiple user interactivity in real it basically involves lots of ajax requests from each user to the server which in turn translates to database reads and the real time result returned from the server is used to update the client side front know optimisation is quite a specialised but what advice would you give me to get maximum speed of operation here speed is of paramount but currently some of these post requests take seconds to way i have thought about optimising it is to club post requests and send them out to the server as a group instead of firing individual i am not currently using caching in the database and really have too much knowledge on what it and whether it will be beneficial in this do the ajax post and get requests incur the same overhead in terms of for optimising database and post request

am working on a web app and i decided reading many post on to store the actual images in the file system and to store the metadata in the i store a relative path or an absolute can think of some advantages for each of the is obvious where the file is even to other apps reading the put the photos anywhere on the drive require an to convert the absoulte path to a relative path for use in the site or create a i migrate to another server i may have to change all the add the link to the html and it i change the app root i have to move the pictures or change all the have to put the pictures in a public directory i gain nothing over the absolute these are some of things going on in my head right storing images in the file use relative paths or absolute	
am working on a web service for changing and removing hotel reservations one booking can contain several stays stay is a link between a the services each stay has own time so you can create 3 stays in the same for 3 different problem arises when bookings need to be the input is the booking id seen as well as the new data on the wanted so if the original stays were 2 single rooms and 1 double each with their own start and end and the customer wished to change one of the single rooms to a double he would 1 2 and up to me to figure out what has changed is not going to so afraid any solutions suggesting to change this is use linq to pick out the current stays and set them for oldstays stay in where bookingid select i can delete i need to make sure that there is available rooms for the new an easy way out would be if linq automatically assumes these records as deleted when making new queries i would not have to worry about existing if that is the the problem is already i need some way of checking for new available reservations while at the same time ignoring stays that have not changed the above i would only need to check if a double room was available in the given since the other double and single are already is there some smart way linq can assist in and if linq state of

answer to the question language is this or is always objectivity is valid and you can somehow reach a conclusion about a language being better for x even if your team is happy with some other language that is not the first choice for a certain but the work can be done a wise team will choose the language that makes them happy because their productivity will also be no one can tell you his choice is better than your they can try to persuade but if for some reason x language makes you more they cannot do anything about said ruby has improved a lot as far as performance is if you ask my biased opinion is choose ruby because i like but if you wanted an unbiased we would have to discuss more aspects and examine what exactly you want to do with the

answer to your question is both yes and if you look in the going by version in section see that a stream within a pdf document can be represented by an so you can go ahead and specify that a pdf its image content in the specified problem will be that when you specify an image within you are specifying a particular image that must have a particular data length and simply specifying dct compression and url is not images are contained in streams of a particular if the stream is too long or too it is considered an you can have images dynamically served provided that they are always exactly the same byte i and i say this because the specification is somewhat ambiguous as to what happens when you set the length to 0 in the stream is doing this maybe need a fairly strong pdf toolkit in order to be able to author these and if you have i think be better off authoring the entire pdf document that your clients want on the fly rather than trying to substitute an image at read

are a couple things you can do to find sexiness here does not have any ootb way to inject the properties of the through table into your contact a m2m table with extra data is a sql so django try to fight the nor guess what should happen in the event of namespace in go so far as to say that you probably do not want to inject arbitrary model properties onto your contact if you find yourself needing to do then probably a sign you should revise your model django provides convenient ways to access the relation both in queries and for data all the while preserving the integrity of the in this find that your object offers a property that you can use to access the through c would produce a list of contactphonenumbers objects for that in your to iterate of all contact phone numbers you contact in for phone in print you really want to do the injection for some see you can do that using the code sample immediately just change the print statements into assignment a separate just for future you could have written your inject function without sql in the through table is itself a so you can query it and then do the result use to get the phone and use to get the contact

are several problems with the model used in the main one being that it express the actual dependency instead it just concatenates a bunch of definitions in a certain often resulting in definitions coming in a different order in each source the include file hierarchy of your software is something you need to know in the same way as you know your you have to know which files are included from read your source know which files are high up in the hierarchy so you can avoid accidentally adding an include so that it will be included think hard when you add a new i really need to include this other files will be drawn in when i do conventions from those already which can help class one source file one header consistently class a goes in and code templates and snippets are good here to reduce the amount of typing needed to declare each class in a separate the to avoid exposing internal members in a header the impl pattern means putting all internal members in a struct defined in the and just have a private pointer with a forward declaration in the this means that the header file will only need to include those headerfiles needed for its public and any definitions needed for its internal members will be kept out of the

are then making the assumption that every time a new list box item is created the control item template definition is going to be processsed for performance reasons this is not the much quicker to create it the first time around and then just clone it each subsequent hence your not getting the result you the result of calling the extension is being cached and get around this you need to return something dynamic instead of try returning an object from providevalue instead of a the returned object will itself contain a counter and when tostring is called on that object it returns the string version of the

arithmetic between operands of different types is legal but the c standard defines rules for type promotion in order to convert the operands to a common automatic type promotion allows the compiler to do something sensible for but does not necessarily mean really know whether or not the behavior is correct you must first understand the rules for promotion and then understand the representation of the data in general types are converted to longer types to to types are converted to conversions favor avoiding data loss signed is converted or depends on the size of the respective code like and have different is right or wrong depends on the values that and can in my experience common practice to prohibit the coding implicit type the programmer must consider the context and explicitly perform any type conversions

attempt to remove object from itself it is a bad and in as3 you do it for be deleted garbage only if there are no references left to that since references always get passed by value and object is generally not aware of which references to it you delete object from the only useful thing you can do is to create a method which will clean up all resources used by an such method will serve as a but have to call it forget that event listeners will also prevent garbage collection unless you remove is also a difference between a property and setting it to effectively will remove a property from an instance of dynamic whereas setting property value to will not remove the but erase any reference that was stored therefore both actions will destroy the reference that was stored in some that you an only a are certain hacks that can be used to initiate garbage collection in flash players 9 and older however recently call got which does the same that you really rely on the fact that gc will actually be this is up to the flash to your throwing event and notifying parent that something went wrong is actually a good you should stick to it is better if parent will know of such event that and not when it will discover that some properties got magically reading grant skinner on in flash player is actually a good

avoid 2 developers working on the same package at the same use your version control system as the source of the package to work on a the developer must first check out the package from version nobody else can check the package out until this developer checks it back work directly on the package code in toad or any other you have whether the code you are working on there is correct or has been modified by one or more other work on the code in the script you have checked out from version and run that into the database to compile the my preference is to use a nice text editor and sql but you can do this in toad when you have check the script back into version copy and paste code out of the database into your script point 2 downside it is of this controlled approach is that only one developer at a time can work on a this be a major problem as long keep packages down to a reasonable size terms of what they not how many lines of code or number of procedures in have one big package that holds all the are encouraged to check out code only when ready to work on and to check it back in as soon as they have finished making and testing their

best explanation is by try for all cars advertised on the web with engines smaller than litres that run and have an mp3 connection and can been seen in a showroom conveniently accessible by public transport from my just be able to help you with that not you have to make several searches and correlate the results on the semantic be able to express an interest in products for sale that are and add the every result would be one or more uis might enable you to do some may be others entirely other creating a chart of things not normally stored in one say the popularity of diet or country walks in a population versus the levels of clinical obesity in the same for these you may not use a web browser at but might use more like but the semantic web gives you tools for finding and manipulating the data that is out there and is accessible via the point made by bravax is not entirely not a lot may change you may merely get some more useful and better mashup web or you may find yourself doing a whole lot of stuff you never thought of as being related to the web before current web has lots of alternatives for doing the same say animated dhtml for putting data on the semantic web there will be a range of tools and rdfa is a good a more general type of but you could a of the whole expose a use a microformat or a proprietary html structure and a there will be many tools to suit different vartec is also partially you may use rdfa and erdf but you could also use a whole lot of other things for publishing that there is a lot over overlap between the semantic web and another simper concept called how they relate to each other but my perception of it is that the linked data web is what you need before semantic web tools and techniques have anything to linked data is about the semantic web is more about processing the reasoning over it and handling issues like trust reliability and such essentially the bottom few layers of technology

brain blew up because it got into an infinite a common beginner it or you already understand just being dragged down by a but faulty metaphor for a a small box with stuff that comes in and instead of a task or such as out more about recursion on the recursive and you have no problem with to complete this task you read a result page for once read follow the first link on it that new page about recursion read follow the first link on it that new page about recursion read follow the first link on it you can been doing recursive stuff for a long time without any how long would you keep doing that forever until your brain blows of course you will stop at a given whenever you believe you have completed the no need to specify this when asking you to out more about recursion on the because you are a human and you can infer that by infer so you must include an explicit out more about recursion on the you understand it or you have read a maximum of 10 also inferred that you should start at result page for and again something a computer the complete description of our recursive task must also include an explicit starting out more about recursion on the you understand it or you have read a maximum of 10 and at grok the whole i suggest you try any of these a gentle introduction to symbolic this is the cutest explanation of little

by in the you mean display different parts in different then suggest you use a presentation pattern like fowler describes in his if your developing a wpf app you can use the more version called if you by mean that use different attributes of the entity in different or part of your then i agree with probably be better off breaking them into different the reason being that in your domain model you should reflect how the entity is used in that specific and if using different parts of the entity under different they probably have different meanings in these settings which again should be reflected in the naming of the and if it were probably make one repository for each of the having a mapping between entities and repositories seems to make sense in most cases as far as but then just like rob conery and of the developers trying to do fairly new to the and so my experiences might be overruled by someone more experienced

can configure sites in iis to require a cert but that would generate an error if someone visiting with https and require all pages to use you could put a filter on iis that checks all requests and redirects them as https calls if they are on your encryption the obvious drawback here is the need to update your list of pages every time a new page is added from an xml file or and restart the think that you are probably correct in building code into the pages that require https that redirects to an https version if they arrive via as far as your cert error you could redirect with a full path includes the instead of a relative path to fix this if you have any questions about how to detect whether the call uses https or how to get the full path of the current request please let me both are pretty straightforward but got sample code if you need the certs that handle multiple subdomains are called wildcard the problem is that they are quite a bit more expensive than standard one other thing to consider is to use a master page or derived class for the pages that need that instead of duplicating the code in each page you can just declare it as type sslpage use the corresponding master and have the class handle the need to do some url processing if you take this approach but it is pretty

cookies they would work irrespective of your load balance options writing your sessionvalues to a sql database you can configure your app to configure session state to use sql server but this has its own problems as sessions never time out u need to handle this via code if not using sql server basically you would face a problem when you have too many users and you implement load balancing on your web server so a user can go to a different web server in the same session it would not is a work around for this too its called sticky sessions where your web server guarantees your user would always hit the same web server within the with provider you can even write your own session storage provider by implementing their delegates so you can create your own xml files on your web server shared server to read write session data there there are many ways you can solve however the simplest and cost effective solution is to use

could be but it seems to me that coming from the wrong are two distinct issues you need to making sure that the propertygrid is only ever accessed on the ui if any of its methods property are accessed from other suffer pain in mysterious the exceptions are and of making sure your search thread can run solve the first make sure your objects are never modified by the ui make all of your event triggers thread aware so that your objects events as are only ever triggered on the ui second problem is easier as long as your search thread only reads from your core everything should work your search thread might inadvertently see some partially updated but is that really an couple of final thoughts implement your search to iterate through the propertygrid obtain a list of the objects up front need to be and work through that you considered using idle processing to do the the object fires an event every time the application runs out of messages to process you could hook into this and perform 1 step of your search each time the event is kind of a but with none of the used this to very good effect in the if i recall propertygrid respects the calling as soon as you start modifying a and when you move to a different you could leverage this to prevent your search thread from seeing incomplete following discovered what you already knew that propertygrid respect the ieditableobject do have another suggestion though it might be more work than you want to the time when the namespace was introduced in i saw an article on using the ambient transaction to provide for the idea is that your object properties have dual first you have the committed visible to all and you have a variable used to store uncommitted values on a when a property is the object enlists in any ambient transaction by storing the new value in the thread when the transaction commits or rolls the value for the thread is either stored or i find the original though it seems that csla provides this hope this

database table without an index is called a querying a heap results in each row of the table being evaluated even with a the notation for a heap is with n being the number of rows in the adding an index this really depends on the underlying aspects of your database results in a complexity of to find the matching row in the this is because the index most certainly is implemented in a sort of adding rows to the even with an index present is an but for pulling down my will take longer as the number of rows i find the sql select will take longer as the rows grow this is true even after i have added an index for the recipient you are inserting into the middle of an at which point the database engine will need to shift rows down to the same occurs when you delete from the remember there is more than one kind of be sure that the index you are using is not a clustered index as more data must be sifted through and moved with inserts and has given the best option available to do not use an rdbms because your messages are not relational in a formal you will get much better performance from a file has also given correct i do not know why he has been voted down 3 but i will vote him up at the risk that i may lose dbarker is referring to and his suggestion is both acceptable and this rocket surgery suggestion is to not implement this kind of functionality in your if you do remember that delete all place locks on pages in your if you do go forward with putting this functionality into a database then run your selects with a nolock locking hint if it is available on your platform to increase additionally if you have so many concurrent partition your tables vertically as dbarker suggested and place these database files on separate drives just volumes but separate to increase

everything i can see the is designed to always return the appropriate uinavigationcontroller as long as the uiviewcontroller exists within a this is probably one of those cases that i seem to run into myself more often than like where a simple coding error is masquerading as something much more in these cases i usually have good luck setting up an entirely new xcode project with the minimal code needed to reproduce the issue and more times than not in that process i find a fix for something i overlooked that can then be easily applied in the main sorry i offer more specifics but what you are describing seems to go against the design of the cocoa touch framework and if you can still reproduce it in a minimal xcode project written in strict accordance with the documentation it may be a good idea to file a bug report with hopefully though you will just find something simple you overlooked and be kicking yourself in a few minutes

example i can think of is an internal database at my company containing information on all it gets a nightly update from hr and has an web service on many other apps use the web service to populate things like pessimism is that the developer thought that repeated calls to the web service would be too slow to make repeated sql so what did he the application start event reads in the entire database and converts it all to objects in stored indefinitely until the app pool is this code was so it would take 15 minutes to load in less than 2000 if you inadvertently recycled the app pool during the it could take 30 minutes or because each web service request would start multiple concurrent for this new hires appear in the database the first day when their account was created and therefore would not be able to access most internal apps on their first couple twiddling their second level of pessimism is that the development manager want to touch it for fear of breaking dependent but yet we continue to have sporadic outages of critical applications due to poor design of such a simple

first assumption is your second it depends on whether it is a post back or not if you are binding if it is not the post back and binding happens automatically roughly the value of the controlparameter is retrieved when datasourceview calls select on right before onselecting the sequence for the gridview any given control for that is as from either sqldatasource or is where values get retrieved using almost for each control in a control the framework recursively calls which then triggers retrieval of data and it is a then those parameters will get loaded from a viewstate on the in the order they are this what you were looking assume controlparameter is bound to property c1 of a control i would imagine that on postbacks controlproperty would always be able to get value from no matter of what type c and even if c has viewstate not entirely how it on post back on initial request for that view state is evaluated only to see if it changed so that the onparameterchanged event could get the actual value of the controlparameter is evaluated against the control it points to in your case be when it reads its value is most likely read from a view but at no point does the controlparameter read view state but may i ask if a page is created for the first a value for controlparameter also be retrieved from the moment lstcities retrieves data from data has its value the at that point first time page the lstcities did not retrieve any data the first time a property evaluation happens is on but before any databind happens shortly when gets the crude trying to place it in a life cycle of a subscribes to loadallstate view state gets raisepostbackevents handle your that following sections assume that you did not do any data inside your is where parameters at this point none of them are data bound if it the first there are no the viewstate is empty for the databind you parameters evaluate their control c would be bound at this controlparameter evaluates and thus retrieves value after c has been controlparameter retrieves values whenever it is which in this scenario happens in two onloadcomplete and databind by on the c is not on after the c is both times controlparameter is asked to read maybe following will are classes and methods of interest in a place them in perspective of the page cycle and hopefully it will be class controlparameter public string controlid in public string propertyname in protected override object control control sourcecontrol using return internal void control or read stored value initial load it is object storedvalue the actual value for this parameter from object actualvalue received a change event if if null storedvalue null actualvalue class sqldatasource by private void eventargs simply calls the updatevalue for each class sqldatasourceview private sqldatasource method gets called by databind on protected internal override ienumerable dbconnection connection dbcommand command is where controlparameter will read values this will be already populated by its own sqldatasourceselectingeventargs e new if return data from data or private void parametercollection idictionary exlusions parameter values from for the iordereddictionary values parameters collection using commandparameters and retrieved so controlparameter checks whether its viewstate to the updatevalue method above to see how it uses i assume controlparameter checks whether its viewstate changed only so that it can fire onparameterchanged but why is handling that event so know that it is i like any other it allows you to track changes in properties and act accordingly to your it gets fired in many but i see where anyone subscribes to property evaluation you mean controlparameter checking its own thus you mean controlparameter evaluating which i assume happens after c has been bound means that the gets which checks viewstate for stated then calls which then finds a control and retrieves data using reflection see presume that by update you mean if is called when data binding takes then what that means is that when on next postback is called in and controlparameter will already have same you are forgetting that the view state is loaded on loadallstate and between it and the onloadcomplete there are six more steps page each of those may modify the source you have and did a post the view state for all controls is loaded if stored value in the view it will load on you decide to set here may decide to store in its view state or not then other events next comes since sqldatasource subscribes to this it will evaluate all associated parameters since you did change but view state did null storedvalue null actualvalue return true and onparameterchanged will be by the there is at least ten other places where this event gets it play big role in data binding and property retrieval

have been developing an application that works with the google maps api to assist in logistics and planning for a small shipping company in our one of the features is for the company to input a list of customers and the system will package up all the customer addresses as a series of send it off to and get back the direction information for the problem that we have been having is that many of the addresses in our database are not great and will often times are not able to be processed by google when we do this we receive back an error but i would like to be able to determine which waypoint was the one to fail way the client can then go and fix the address in the here is a chunk of the code that handles the initialization and current error if map new gdir new if function var waypoints new var str waypoints function if corresponding geographic location could be found for one of the specified this may be due to the fact that the address is relatively or it may be else if geocoding or directions request could not be successfully yet the exact reason for the failure is not error else if http q parameter was either missing or had no for geocoder this means that an empty address was specified as for directions this means that no query was specified in the error else if given key is either invalid or does not match the domain for which it was error else if directions request could not be successfully error else unknown error problem is that the method in the gdirections object seem to return status based on each individual but from just the entire list one fails it all only real solution i can think of performing checks in other areas of the is to send each waypoint off to google maps in a separate request and check validity that way prior to sending off the entire waypoints list for the gdirections but that seems incredibly inefficient when dealing with a larger set of customer maps api finding waypoint that caused

hope that in this i can get opinions on best practices for the interface between jsf pages and backing thing that i never can settle on is the structure of my backing i have never found a good article on the properties belong on which backing when is it appropriate to add more properties to a given bean as opposed to creating a new bean and adding the properties onto for simple does it make sense to just have a single backing bean for the whole considering the complexity involved with injecting one bean into should the backing bean contain any actual business or should it strictly contain free to answer these questions and any others that may come for reducing coupling between the jsf page and the backing i never allow the jsf page to access any backing bean for i never allow something such always require something a backing bean value string return i loop over a i use a wrapper class to avoid drilling down into an object in a data for this approach feels to it avoids any coupling between the view and the please correct me if backing bean structure

i assume that by pl you mean presentation not persistence implementing a layered application the main question should always can i replace the implementation of a lower layer without impacting the implementation of the is usually best illustrated by the persistence if you switch from sql server 2008 to mysql for the persistence layer changes but are changes in the business layer also for does the business layer catch sqlexception instances that are only thrown by in a good the business layer needs no changes at same principle should apply to the separation between business layer and presentation your i would say that the should not be in the presentation it has nothing to do with the implementation of processing a request is not a concern for the presentation compare it with a web presenting a to a client is the concern of the web retrieving an instance of is the concern of a layer below the presentation whether to have a facade between your business layer and persistence layer is i usually do not implement a facade because it adds an extra layer of i do not see a problem in calling persistence layer methods directly from business layer if only you take the same principle into can you change the persistence layer implementation without affecting the business layer

i have summed up what you need to do when implementing iequatable and provided the justification from the various msdn documentation testing for value equality is desired as when using objects in you should implement the iequatable override and gethashcode for your testing for reference equality is desired you should use and should only override and for and immutable reference interface is used to compare two instances of an object for the objects are compared based on the logic implemented in the the comparison results in a boolean value indicating if the objects are this is in contrast to the which return an integer indicating how the object values are iequatable interface declares two methods that must be the equals method contains the implementation to perform the actual comparison and return true if the object values are or false if they are the gethashcode method should return a unique hash value that may be used to uniquely identify identical objects that contain different the type of hashing algorithm used is should implement iequatable for your objects to handle the possibility that they will be stored in an array or generic you implement iequatable you should also override the base class implementations of and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the for overriding and operator programming returns returns the same value as returns then returns invocations of equals return the same value as long as the objects referenced by x and y are not equals returns false value types for more see types programming new implementation of equals should not throw is recommended that any class that overrides equals also override is recommended that in addition to implementing any class also implement for their own to enhance the operator tests for reference equality by determining whether two references indicate the same reference types do not have to implement operator in order to gain this when a type is that the data that is contained in the instance cannot be overloading operator to compare value equality instead of reference equality can be useful as immutable they can be considered the same as long as they have the same is not a good idea to override operator in operator implementations should not throw type that overloads operator should also overload operator operator predefined value the equality operator returns true if the values of its operands are false reference types other than returns true if its two operands refer to the same the string compares the values of the testing for null using comparisons within your make sure you use the base object class if you infinite recursion will occur resulting in a method your programming language supports operator overloading and if you choose to overload the equality operator for a given that type must override the equals such implementations of the equals method must return the same results as the equality following guidelines are for implementing a overriding equals to gain increased performance over that provided by the default implementation of equals on you override equals and the language supports operator you must overload the equality operator for your value following guidelines are for implementing a overriding equals on a reference type if the semantics of the type are based on the fact that the type represents some reference types must not overload the equality even if they override if you are implementing a reference type that is intended to have value such as a complex number you must override the equality overriding make sure you test reference types for null before using them in the hash ran into a problem with programming and operator overloading described

i just clarify you want to put your machine into german mode to test your web which just happens to be running on the same machine as the this is running for real can we assume that the sever could be hosted outside germany maybe in germany but on a machine set up with a us locale it happens a if so setting the culture on the server really what you and you probably be able to do that when you deploy also have another there is no way you can detect which culture your user wants to you can detect all sorts of info from the http do a domain lookup on the ip but what if a german speaker wanted to use your site from the or an american was in germany and wanted to see and not for the decimal put it another i am saying it matter what culture your pc is using it is not relevant because once you go over the web all bets are off even if your app did detect your culture correctly it might not be what your user the way i would do this is to ask the user what language they want and then explicitly set the locale in your application at run this does mean asking the user to pick a langague but the only way to be sure of using the right locale for the if all your users are german then you have to you can just hard code if his approach sounds like it might work then some good sample code or rather viel

i must say i read the article and please take this the wrong but i think the best way to learn about shortcomings of your own framework or to find out if it meets certain standards is to open it up make it open source and let other developers take part in they will be pretty quick to complain or point out if your only goal in creating this framework is to i think you can benefit from a code and what better way to get a code review than by inviting other people to join you in your way you should also have the chance to challenge the others code and maybe ask questions to find out why they write code a certain hope find this at least a little bit helpful going to take a look at that link

i read your question is is an ambiguous grammar or production rule consider the language you are what would be the implication of allowing an ambiguous production rule into the example describes a language which might include an expression b t b t b resolved as in your second example would be t b b t b t but in an ambiguous grammer it could also become t b t b t b or even t b t b t b t which could be valid might depend on the if the operator models it really be but if it was it might be this really depends on the second question to consider is what the resulting grammar source file ends up looking after the conflicts are as with other source a grammar is meant to be read by and secondarily also by prefer a notation that gives a clearer explanation of what the parser is trying to do from the that if the parser is executing some possibly undefined for order of evaluation of a arguments in an eager make the grammar

implementation of ruby and jruby have quite different threading implementations so it may be impossible to have the answer for your but it appears that you might be trying to write fast concurrent code in my experiences with ruby is that this a reasonable ruby may be but still has a global interpreter lock like you are writing ruby code where you are considering these sort of potentially unsafe optimizations to wring out some extra you should probably consider using another idiomatic ruby tends to emphasize readability and expressiveness before efficiency and trying to wring speed increases and increased reliability out of the mri has been an exercise in frustration for been working on a ruby project for awhile that has just entered the phase where we are seriously looking at running the project in jruby and replacing the bottlenecks implemented in ruby with java libraries resulted in a pretty remarkable increase in speed and reliability with relatively little effort on our is not but its java integration has proven to be helpful and if it is impossible to use jruby for your or you are comfortable with c but not and sure you can write safe c without memory writing a c extensions to ruby or may be the best apologize if this question was completely academic in perhaps if you could let us know trying to

important concept in analysis of algorithms is in the case of two algorithms with different asymptotic running such as one and one as is the case with insertion sort and quicksort is not definite that one is faster than the important distinction with this sort of analysis is that for large one algorithm will be faster than when analyzing an algorithm down to a term like you drop when realistically analyzing the running of an those constants will be important only for situations of small what does this that means for certain small some algorithms are this from includes an interesting perspective on choosing different sorting algorithms in the case of a limited space and limited memory of the article references only sorting a list of 20 so larger orders of n is shorter code and less memory consumption well as avoiding were ultimately more important sort has low it can be written fairly and it has several two key it is and it has a fairly fast running case when the input is nearly	
important difference here is that between value types and reference types represent directly a certain whereas reference types point to a memory location that should represent a when a a reference type actually does not point to a memory location with valid the reference is value types are direct representations of they cannot be it might be the case that a actual value of a value type is for this provides the nullable types when such a construct is not people tend to use special or default such as communicating with a lot of things we expect to be value types can actually be since that it the way the database handles unknown this can also be solved by the nullable but these were not always why dbnull to deal with a possible null in a

is a found nothing interesting over the developing a memory management module for my we develop games for consoles ps3 and we consider pc a need in for our next to handle texture streaming for large game worlds that cannot be loaded all in main console memory talking about pc for are going to stream at the beginning mipmaps of textures is about of the size of world maybe in the future have to stream also smaller developing a memory manager for that focused on x360 over ps3 we can use host memory and the gmm problem facing is the we have decided to reserve a specific memory area for texture streaming example 64 and we want to handle all allocations and deallocations in that we have allocated the area at the beginning of the application and the area is physically guaranteed to be contiguous just cause we need to store textures implemented an auto defragmenting using handles instead of time is not an the problem is memory in game we continuously load and unload streaming so like to use the maximum amount of our buffer this allocator we can use all of the allocated space but the defragmentation routine works in an unaccettable time 60 more than a while the algorithm is not too there are just too meny unevitable looking for a solution to solve this like to find at least a good or a or someone who have faced the same problem of choosing between two move the defragmentation routine on a dedicated thread for x360 with 6 hw bad for ps3 with just a hw and tell me to use with all multithreading problems of locking of accessing a region who is being find an solution to defragmentation we can give each frame a time budget example up to 1 for defragmentation and the memory manager will do what it can do in the budget each someone tell me his experience memory management for texture streaming in

is an answer i posted to a question a while i modified it a bit to fit this has shown me that there are 3 major goals you have when learning a legacy learn what the code is supposed to learn how it does learn why it does them the way it three of those parts are very and a few tricks to help you get resist the temptation to just whatever your ide your way around the code to understand you probably be able to keep everything in perspective in your mind this especially when each line forces you to look at multiple other classes in order to understand what it so you need to be able to hold several levels of the stack in your documentation where it usually helps you quickly gain a mental framework upon which to build everything that test cases where be afraid to ask someone who knows if you have a you waste time with inane but if something that you simply understand is especially true with more conceptual questions it make much more sense to implement this as a or probably worth finding out the answer before you mess something up and know you do finally get down to reading the start at a logical place and go from just read the code top to or in alphabetical or anything is probably

is supposed to be i think microsoft recommend it for up to 4 or 5 but in practice recommend that you never use an access database where there is more than a single although if you really have the choice acceptable for two or given certain had experience of four or five systems using an access database all acquired from other and in all cases moved them to sql server as the as a priority after any immediate updates and fixes required when taking the contract generally as soon as i could talk the boss paying the bill into time span for that is usually several so i have seen it running concurrent for a reasonable length of time under several different it will generally work passably well if the system does not have a lot of concurrent and is not heavily the chief practical problems in my experience liable to corruption it just generally this too much of a problem as opening the file and running compact and repair will sort out the but a good backup regime is absolutely every time upgraded a system to sql server received a lot of kudos for speeding up the system from the database file bloats because of the way that access marks records as updated or this further slows the system as the file has to be loaded across the consequently some regime that compresses the usually on a daily is of the above are much less of a problem with single user systems as the underlying issues that prompt these are much less in all i must emphasise that i would never recommend access for any however if really have too probably get away with it so long as a lightly used application and you do institute the backup and maintenance

know how to to use the default platform ui they know what they look how they and the platform ones work really know how to use your and even if you try and copy the platform one except for your widget will behave as a cheap it will be missing features the user your scroll thumb to show the length of the with a minimum size such that its always but only on platforms where that is scroll to the position scroll down and scroll up and each in proportion to where clicked on the scrollbar on the platform where this is clicking in the blank space between the thumb and up or down arrow does it scroll by the amount the user is which varies by scrolling go at the speed the user expects when the scroll buttons are held is the user dragging the thumb handled when the mouse goes outside the or on the your custom scroll bar follow the visual theme the user selected because he needs widgets due to answer to most of those is probably at been my experience with web sites where the designer decided the platform scroll bars cute

know that tempting to assign names to servers that describe their functions and other similar attributes and in a perfect world that will work but in practice i have found that after a while these things get messed up as functions and other parameters of the servers change the requirements of the business so the names no longer reflect the think you should assign unique names to the servers that do not tell anything about the function or other parameters and have some sort of to list detailing those things so that your people can look it what we do other extreme is using ip addresses only or having names based on ip addresses which can lead to a disaster too if you ever have to change your ip

language spec performing overload a method with a parameter may be applicable either in its normal form passing an its expanded form passing a variable number of expanded form of a method is available only if the normal form of method is not available and only if a method with the same as the expanded form is not already declared in the same a if overload resolution is the compiler chooses the guess the reasons for that decision of making code like yours your method has the void you want to have some way to call the passing an so the compiler has to handle ambiguous cases a temporary array is a lot more expensive than a method so you might want to create overloads with parameters that behave the same but are more

maintaining a legacy embedded device which interacts with the real this device collects data from processes the data using its internal and displays warning when data reaches a certain debugging we wish this device will send us on a regular basis many of the data it as well as the data after it processed reached to the conclusion that most of the data can be described in a tabular something along the lines obviously need to support more than one form of basically we need a protocol that is able to accept a certain set of tables description and then to deliver table data according to its example pseudo code for sending data table example pseudo code for receiving data case for case the tables could be done either off line both at the device and at the client computer communicating with or we can add a simple handshake protocol to agree upon format at the this is a legacy it supports only rs232 and since its cpu is pretty slow to we cannot afford using any data transfer those are too expensive or sending raw sql commands was also considered and rejected due to bandwidth too reduce the overhead of sending the table header each trying to avoid sending the table header each time sending so that each time sending a table just have to send the tables also would like to note that most of the data i wish to pass is so protocols are too seen protocol close enough but it support idea about a known protocol or implementation like what i any better idea to send this aware to the fact that this protocol is not very hard to i had in mind a two phase send the headers of all tables you wish to each table description would include information about the size of each send the table index to followed by the actual data will be followed by a i wish to avoid the small details of such and use some or even use an available format to pass tabular

object could be need to instatiate	
object is a local variable with type that variable likely gets allocated on the stack for the just like any other local but the stored in is a null it point there is no instance of type represented call a virtual the caller needs to know which object the function is being called because the object itself is what tells which function should really be frequently implemented by giving the object a pointer to a a list of and the caller just knows supposed to call the first function on the without knowing in advance where that pointer to call a the caller need to know all the compiler knows exactly which function will get so it can generate a instruction to go directly to the desired it simply passes a pointer to the object the function was called on as a hidden parameter to the in other the compiler translates your function call into since the implementation of that function never makes reference to any members of the object pointed to by its you effectively dodge the bullet of dereferencing a null pointer because you never dereference calling function even a one on a null pointer is undefined one of the allowed results of undefined behavior is that your code appears to run exactly as you rely on although you will sometimes find libraries from your compiler vendor that rely on but the compiler vendor has the advantage of being able to add further definition to what would otherwise be undefined do it

option could be to use the this handler does close every alert or confirm dialog that popups up but first it gets the text shown by the dialog and stores you can inspect this alerts string array and see if the count is you could do this in the teardown or fixtureteardown of the test a copy of a test from the watin unittest to show you how you can use this public void dialogwatcher count should be zero before create handler for alert and confirm dialogs and register var dialoghandler new using remove the alert text from the queue by using clear the dialogwatcher count should be zero after also triggers me to make the autoclose behavior more it would be nice if one could register a dialoghandler that will be called if no other handlers can handle a instead of just auto closing the van dev

original question seem to recall reading that the cost of a virtual call in is not as as in the in other the question might be rephrased seem to recall reading that in virtual and calls are equally whereas in a virtual call is slower than the questioner is not claiming that is faster than under any a useless but this sparked my curiosity concerning with using no the compiler produces il that gets converted to native code by the although it is pure so here we have a way of seeing what a standard implementation does if running on the same platform as a void new causes the opcode to be emitted with the specific method passing bar an implicit void with an inheritance virtual void derived void if we new emits the opcode which jumps to a computed address so a lot of il before the by turning it back in to we can see what is going other cast the address of to a pointer to int happens to be the same size as a and take the value at that which is the address of the and then take the first item in the which is the address to jump dereference it and call passing it the implicit can tweak the virtual example to use struct virtual void struct derived virtual void override gcnew generates the exactly as it would in instance void when compiling to target the current compiler have the same possibilities for optimization as does when using the standard features of each for a standard class the compiler generates code that contains logic for traversing the whereas for a ref class it leaves it to the jit to figure out the optimal

other ways line the registry is appropriate for many kinds of configuration by choosing a suitable place in the you can make some configuration some configuration sound like your application but mention it or any combination of the windows manages the storage of the data and provides a rudimentary way for users to edit it the registry makes it more difficult to run more than one instance of your program with different options at the same can store configuration information in a text file on this allows you to keep the configuration in the same place as the which makes it easier to find using the you have to tell the user where to configuration files can usually be edited with a regular text generally you will have to specify what format is to be used and to read and parse the text handling syntax errors if method allows you to easily run more than one instance of your each with its own separate configuration file your app looks in its own directory for the config for line program can read its configuration information from the command but you still have to store the data somewhere the command line can only support a limited amount of information before it gets program could read its configuration information from environment these might be variables that are set by a script that runs your programs you have the same problems as command line the data must still be stored somewhere or might be a globally set environment variable supplied by the windows provides very primitive tools for changing the global less accessible than even this choice is not often used on is an advanced technique that requires cooperation with some other program that the data into shared like many other the data must still be stored somewhere else in the first not recommended unless you really know you need

others trying both is one good but to i would base it more on which language you prefer to if a web do a lot with the but line of code you write will be in that since both frameworks are really more a matter of what language be happiest writing code day in and day personally use rails and love but have many friends using when we discuss time and it boils down more to language than the languages are fairly and typically find one you prefer a lot more than the at least in my i had originally thought python sounded learned wrote a few things with but it just never for when i first saw ruby many years ago it seemed a bit but when i revisited it via it just felt so when i write code in ruby i feel like pretty much writing english if i can think of how i think the code should be i can pretty much type that and it it just fits my brain get a lot of different i think being means nor do i think the ruby community is by any means especially compared to say the java ruby and rails have certainly gone mainstream to some and for those of us worked with it for several it seems but in the grand scheme of things actually still fairly good and looking into them and finding what will delight you to work

parts of boost are very to use a small boost often you end up a huge amount of it is actually quite astonishing if you generate a dependency perhaps you need to support the dozen or so platforms that boost so a smaller amount of code would be easier to employer or the environment your product must work in may be certain national agencies that review your code may object to 3rd party code developed by unknown entities though the source code is clearly certain national agencies may not be comfortable with the coding standards used to develop they may want you to take ownership of that boost code and bring it up to their and coding in that case it may be far less expensive to develop your own version of the boost most likely your version will not have the usefuleness or scope of the boost code in this and may in fact take hours of painful debugging to make it but it may be just fine for your not saying i agree with the above i but the environment some of us find ourselves

preference would be c or because not separated from the machine language by a jit want to do intense performance and that means stepping through the hot spots one instruction at a time to see what it is and then tweaking the source code so as to generate optimal you get the compiler to generate what you consider good enough assembler then by all means write your own assembler for the hot describing a situation where the need for performance is i would not do if i were in your shoes is rely on anecdotal generalizations about one language being faster or slower than what i would do is multiple passes of intense performance tuning along the lines of and and i have done this sort of thing numerous and the key is to iterate the cycle of because every slug fixed makes the remaining ones more until you literally squeeze another cycle out of that is it the case that there is some configuration information that determines how the bulk of the data is if it may be that the program is spending a lot of its time the configuration info to figure out what to do if it is usually a big win to write a that will read the configuration info and generate an program that can whizz through the data without constantly having to figure out what to

prototype for write const void while it writes in unites of it can take a pointer of any passing an will be no problem at would recomend that you also send the amount of integers you plan to send first so the reciever knows how much to something like this checking omitted for count if the array is from dynamic memory you malloced you cannot use sizeof on in this case count would be equal to you will likely need to be careful of issues as this is the case when sending any multibyte value in the count i recommended as well as each element of the this is done with and

read a statement somewhere that generating ui automatically from db layout business or whatever other business is a bad i can also imagine a few good challenges that one would have to face in order to make something like i have not seen could any examples of people attempting thus wondering is it really that definately not but can it be done with any measure what are the major it would be great to see some examples of successes and clarify with ui i mean that the all forms with all their controls are generated completely automatically runtime or compile based perhaps on some hints in metadata on how the data should be this is in contrast to designing forms by hand most people found somewhat related it seems that one way this can get pretty fair results is if enough metadata is for this how much would be and would it be any less work than designing the form does it also provide greater flexibility for future ui from db the the bad and the

real even if it is really hard to grasp if you have not used is that you loose the language has concepts that you cannot possibly express in and they have they are part of the but lost in the translation to is not an but rather an that you have a container that is sorted on a field of the elements that are those objects are really you need to offer access to the data for readers showing the information in the in you can go in one of two either you make a copy for the caller to use that the data will not but or you return a reference to your internally held object hoping the caller will not change your data through the user gets the reference and changes through it the field that serves as then your container invariants are you can return a constant and the compiler will disable calling setter methods on the instance you you get both the security that the user will not change and efficiency in the third not mentioned before option is making the object but that disables changes perfectly controlled changes to the object will be and the only possibility of change is creating a new element with the changes that amounts to time and

really dug deep inside mvc but i guess custom modelbinder and actionresult will do the	
really odds are if your program is this the it should be noted that you make a completely equal is more similar to this example will use it it qstring your code macro is able to do this by using some compiler extensions to get the type of the container also imagine that is very similar in reason why your example fair is that your version is adding extra are indexing instead of really if you are using a type with allocation suspect this might be the case with then indexing will be more expensive since the code has to calculate the item are indexing using the function instead of this function is usually implemented in such a way that is more expensive than this because least the are required to do bounds checking in this all indexes are in and potentially throw an does not have this requirement it is legal for it to do the bounds but that make sense in practice because that goes against being it the timing difference between those two pieces of code will be negligible if existent at waste your time worrying about write whichever you find more clear and as a currently i strongly favor the version of container it is concise and you code

reason this is happening is that when an image is specified in a css and that image is missing the routing framework tries to map the url to a ignoring the routes as listed below will prevent the error from but i decided not to implement it because a nice way of being notified that you have a missing can see a detailed explanation along with examples of setting up dependency injection using structure map was having the same issue and i think i figured it for whatever reason whenever you try to provide your own controller factory you need to add a couple of additional ignoreroute the first thing i would do is add this line to your getcontrollerinstance return will at least give you more information in the error message as to what the request is that is causing the controllertype to be in my particular case i had a background image in my css file set like what happens is the routing is looking for a controller called and an action that takes or something along those obviously not the correct some digging i realized i needed to add an ignoreroute definition to my file that would ignore anything in the directory of my site like still not sure why you need to do this with the default but nonetheless it probably run into the same issue with particularly if you using google need to add this as new	
reason why this happens is that when a plugin is invoked from the command line like it has no phase or execution associated with this means it picks up the unnamed execution which is the config outside the execution you really want to run multiple bind them to a phase and then invoke that in this case each execution will run with its own real unasked question here is why you are using to deploy a bunch of stuff like if 3rd party you should get a repo manager like and upload them once to a repository for your whole team to

server is a row oriented this is in contrast to a column oriented this means that in sql all of the data for a given row is stored together on the have an you have a customer table with 3 and say you have 3 records in this table for jabba dennis and george a row oriented database sql the records will be stored on disk as a column oriented database would store the records on disk like hutt columns are grouped together instead of when you go to add a column to a table in a row oriented database for the new data for each column has to be inserted alongside the existing shifting the rows requiring a lot of if you were to insert a new column for the customer prefix that defaults to this is what you can all of the original data has been shifted to the on the other when you insert a new column that defaults to no new data has to be put into the existing there is less requiring fewer disk this an oversimplification of actually going on on there are other things to take into account when dealing with it should help you get the not at all suggesting you move to a column oriented i just put that info in there to help explain what row oriented

the right that depends entirely on the if you need to plug your code into another framework or whatever you probably have to use whatever language that framework is made making your own probably there are several reasons why suggest you go with another well suited for if your goal is to learn programming through these go with a language that is more amenable to by is full of pitfalls and things that to until one day they add to this a horribly complex syntax and some pretty complex idioms and techniques you have to master to work around quirks of the language that simply are in pretty much any other and you have a good source of bugs and and not much has no concept of come with any kind of support for processing or playing loading or saving audio files or anything most modern languages have some form of audio support built into the standard language least the ability to load and play mp3 files and other such in all of this will have to be done through libraries and you have a real choice in say go for something like python or easier to come with a lot more functionality out of the and make it a lot harder to shoot yourself in the i recommend to someone who already an experienced

the simplest solution be to update references to session objects that are company dependent with a dynamic key based on the createsessionkey generates the corresponding key possibly by a simple concatenation of company and would then differentiate the two or more companies by accessing the session via generated the example company1 would access the session variable via the key and company2 would access the session variable via the key you have have things like littered all over your code base as that would make refactoring your code a real i abstract my session variables into a strongly typed then my session management is contained in one the idea of having a base page class and overriding the session property is a nice way to go if all you session variables are to be company though if you can determine if a particular session key is a generic session variable or company specific then it may still be

there a way to tell the compiler in my to optimize certain code even if that code is not i just want those symbols in the object here is a simple and i do want this function to be even if never there is no official compiler is there a trick to make the compiler think that an important or at least make it think that it safely be i tried something like bool that seem to do you really want to know why i on earth would want that it has to do with instead of explicit template instantiation with class i simply want to be able to write since in many cases easier since it implicitly instantiates all functions and it does work fine in debug mode without optimizations is what i want to do a compilable mini files are given to me and not foo t heavy long compile the standard way to instantiate it is template class but in reality it is often hard to find out exactly what types i have to usage like will instantiate dependent types if interface that i extracted from foo t no heavy can include anywhere and compile return in function undefined reference to ld returned 1 exit tried precompiled headers but the template instantiation method makes for much faster without optimization is not so ideal because then the library code and will run to tell compiler to not optimize certain code

there are two general approaches to optional them in the tablea s nullable relationships to child tables that contain logical groupings of i think that unless dealing with an extremely large number of optional attributes you should favour nullable the overhead is so low when compared to doing lots of plus if you have child tables via relationships storing the primary key again a foreign key in the child so any storage overhead of nullable columns is in fact all that

think on the right track with your understanding of presentation as to when you should create a view the answer is probably in your you can probably get away with passing the blogpost and comments in the viewdata not but it gets the job and if that starts to feel ugly or then i would start thinking about making a view i usually end up with the notion of some sort of which includes the page common and then specific stuff for a particular in your that might end up as a which includes blogpost and list nice thing about that approach is that you can then test that controller by making a request and testing the blogviewpage to ensure that it contains the expected

think that everything suggested is there are a couple ways you can go about validator an could be done addressvalidator new valid address address way you recognize that the addressvalidator is coupled to the you could do this using the iscomplete in is a good oop heuristic to say that all objects should construct with valid but it just always oop maximizes the information you can take advantage force as many errors to occur at compile rather than run user interfaces will thwart this at all you kind of have to violate this think the j2ee convention is to construct objects without parameters and call a hundred for address int two you want to be technical about valid then you really have two different the state returned by your ui and the state needed by your why not make the difference for if my ui has 12 fields i could have a object that has 12 string in control of regardless of what the user i can make sure the ui returns 12 you can then create an instance of and call on uiaddress address modeladdress all going to depend on your intended but there really is a lot of flexibility for the way is to put in the

this intended for of the video editors seen will each frame by storing each frame into its own image are you stuck with using this storage it would be significantly more efficient if the source videos were stored in a video format already per and there was an index for each video the file offsets for each then you can use the operating caching mechanism to help improve your thing you may want to although it probably help much with networked is to store the images in yuv your application which displays the videos might run faster because the conversion and often because you can offload the work of drawing the yuv image to the video thus leaving more time for the filesystem i do this when drawing onto an x display just to avoid far as caching the i would probably use a separate thread to read the images from disk as fast as you can while the main thread assembles and presents the the main thread can do its loop once per frame presentation and the separate thread can block when the amount of images reaches a certain video players like mplayer use such	
this is a bit hard to answer without knowing how detailed guidance you but an makes such applications quite since both and threading are readily my solution would probably involve a global stack containing new and a farm of a constant number of threads that pop urls from the store the urls as a custom so that i could keep track of the think your main issue here will be with sites that or follow the http noticed many times in similiar applications that sometimes these time out and eventually they end up blocking all the unfortunately i have any good solutions few useful classes as a starting

this particular i think that the weakest link your application is using md5 rather than the manner in which md5 is is that given that it is possible to generate such that because the is limited because there are any tricks to reduce the search is not necessarily this means that if you know you can generate such that this giving a valid in this case the message still remains the and p been if the attacker tries to forge message with a then it is highly unlikely that unless in which they would have the if they have the then that means that it matter if you used sha or since checking if v is equivalent to checking if that sha might take constant time longer to that affect the complexity of the on given the you really ought to just go ahead and use there is no sense in not using unless there is a serious drawback to using second thing is you probably store the password in your database in what you should store is a hash of the and then use in your the hash would be time and you could safely store in your an attacker stealing your database something like sql would still be able to forge i see any way around

this we want to avoid having to write a special query since the query would have to be different across multiple using only hibernate we want to be able to escape special situation is the reason for needing the ability to escape special that we have table in the table contains only 1 called the field can contain characters that may be considered special in a two examples of such a name are and both the and are special at least in if a user wants to search for one of these examples after they are entered in the problems may this is the value that the user has given the application to use for its if the user wants to search for the user is going to be returned with every entry in the this is because the character represents the number of wildcard for string matching and the sql code that hibernate produces will look from foo where name like there a way to tell hibernate to escape certain or to create a workaround that is not database type hibernate is there a way to escape special

time i have problem with virtual have core class for my game this class contains a field with model class object contains values such as position while drawing i need to read position of each object from the problem starts when instead of default model class using class genericgameobject public defaultgameobjectmodel model new missile genericgameobject public new missilemodel model new defaultgameobjectmodel public vector2 position new missilemodel defaultgameobjectmodel m new not tried to make model defined as virtual property instead of but this fails properties have to be of same type as their casting is futile because there will be many other model what can i do if i want to read a value from derived not from asked this question already but the answer brought any use interface is but i have to enforce interfaces define fields so i have to define but then i do because position is not a make genericgameobject a generic type such as genericgameobject and missile a type derived from then cast a missile to genericgameobject and generally store those object on same of course i could make main base type which those two could inherit but then i have access to model make model a property instead of is impossible to change property type in derived can i polymorphism question once again overriding

time you go through servers that you control there is a risk of someone either changing the data or reading the can encrypt whatever data you send that is sensitive within the and not be concerned with what type of connection is set would agree that encrypting is as it is a small price to pay if the data is sensitive or if data integrity is important data integrity is the only real issue then you can digitally sign it and just check the signature of the data when received to make certain it changed

tried it roughly about halfway through the project i realized that my models were hopelessly out of date from my code and were so complex that keeping them up to date was prohibitive and slowing me problem is that software is full of edge models are great at capturing the larger picture but once you start to actually code the implementation you keep finding all those edge cases and before too long you notice that the model is far too granular and you have to make a choice between maintaining the model or getting some code maybe the boilerplate generation is a benefit for starting up but after that the benefits quickly vanish and i found that i got a drastic drop in the models eventually disappeared from that

tried to do the exact same thing and spent far too much time in the i settled on using the gzip compressor provided by tinymce and concentrated on combining the css files and images for what i the problem is that tinymce is it dynamically loads the files it and it make use of an existing javascript so it ends up replicating a lot of the same code if you are already using any sort of was the only other editor i felt had the same features and browser but it look like it was going to be any easier in terms of integrating into my caching scheme sounds similar to and i think the licensing made it a for you can look at a of editors available but those were the two i felt were the best from that in the i decided to go with tinymce and added making a wysiwyg editor for mootools onto my list since the javascript framework i most often you were to hack at i would suggest figuring out every script that your specific implementation of tinymce combine them in and then isolate and comment out the code that loads each if you could then try the combined file as if you do get it to love to

trying to use an unmanaged c dll for loading image data into a the library has a fairly simple interface where you pass in a struct that contains three one to receive the size of the one that receives each row of the pixels and finally one called when the load is like this managed struct public public public types starting are delegate int int the test file that using the setsize should get called then the sendline will get called 200 times for each row of pixels in the finally the done callback gets what actually happens is that the sendline is called 19 times and then a accessviolationexception is thrown claiming that the library tried to access protected have access to the code of the c library i change the and during the loop where it calls the sendline method it does not allocate or free any new so my assumption is that the delegate itself is the issue and i need to pin it before i pass it in have no code inside the delegate itself besides a counter to see how often it gets so i doubt breaking anything on the managed the problem is that i know how to do the method been using to declare the structs in unmanaged space work with delegates and i find any other suitable the delegates themselves are static fields in the program class so they be being garbage but i guess the runtime could be moving blog entry by chris says that delegates need to be pinned before being passed into unmanaged the unmanaged function pointer must refer to a fixed it would be a disaster if the gc were relocating this leads many applications to create a pinning handle for the this is completely the unmanaged function pointer actually refers to a native code stub that we dynamically generate to perform the transition this stub exists in fixed memory outside of the gc i know if this holds true when the delegate is part of a it does imply that it is possible to manually pin them and interested in how to do this or any better suggestions as to why a loop would run 19 times then suddenly to answer code that allocates the struct is as new new some other sendline protocolsize the and the variables are both static fields of the program if i understand the internals of this that means that passing an unmanaged pointer to a of the variable into the c but that copy contains a reference to the static this should mean that the copy touched by the gc since it is unmanaged and the delegate be collected since it is still in scope struct actually gets passed to the library as a return value from another but as a static intptr return there is another struct type that holds the image filename and the function pointer to this the library figures out what type of image is stored in the file and uses this callback to request the correct protocol struct for the given my filename struct is declared and managed in the same way as the protocol one so probably contains the same but since this delegate is only called once and called quickly i had any problems with it to to everybody for their but after spending another couple of days on the problem and making no progress i decided to shelve in case anyone is interested i was attempting write a tool for users of the lightwave 3d rendering application and a nice feature would have been the ability to view all the different image formats that lightwave supports of which are fairly i thought that the best way to do this would be to write a wrapper for the plugin architecture that lightwave uses for image manipulation so i could use their code to actually load the unfortunately after trying a number of the plugins against my solution i had a variety of errors that i understand or fix and my guess is that lightwave call the methods on the plugins in a standard probably to improve the security of running external code stab in the i for the time being going to drop the image feature and if i do decide to reinstate it approach it in a different i learnt a lot through this process even though i get the result i a delegate within a struct before passing to unmanaged

unload event is raised in the control right before since the page itself is a control the unload event is raised for it as each control you add to the page will be part of the page so if you have a control that needs to do some the control itself should handle any possible cleanup in you should not have to worry about provided the control has been added to the page and properly follows the encapsulation says that you should use this even do final cleanup for specific such as closing database my recommendation would be to avoid the unload when possible do any cleanup code sooner rather than so use if you in a like the choice between using a variable as opposed to a local the latter is

use break horribly on types necessarily be easy to and in this likely to be much slower than simply initializing both members to zero assignments versus a function you do not usually want to zero out all members of a you want to zero out the ones for which zero is a meaningful default and you should get into the habit of initializing your members to a meaningful value in any blanket zeroing everything and pretending the problem exist just guarantees a lot of headaches if you add a member to a decide whether that member should be and and when you do want at least use which is compatible with programming in use the tools makes call it	
use char when length of the value is for example we are generating a code or something based on some algorithm which returns the code with the specific fixed lenght lets say i found varchar one more reason to use varchar is that when you get the value back in your application you need to trim that in the case of char you will get the full length of the column whether the value is filling it fully or it would get filled by spaces and you end up trimming every and forgetting that would lead to

was curious about this all fine to read documentation and theoretical but i like to balance those with empirical have a mysql table that has records in the table is in my own private so i know the contents are static and nobody else is using the i think this effectively removes all outside affects on i have a table with an primary key field that i know will never be null that i will use for my where clause test id is not only other possible glitch i see in running tests is the the first time a query is run will always be slower than subsequent queries that use the same refer to that below as the cache seeding just to mix it up a little i ran it with a where clause i know will always evaluate to true regardless of any data said here are my where where id is not null where 9 min sec 6 min sec 2 min sec 6 min sec 1 min sec 2 min sec 6 min se 1 min sec 1 min 5 min sec 1 min sec 2 min sec 5 min sec 1 min sec 2 min 6 min sec 2 min sec 2 min 6 min sec 1 min sec 1 min is considered the cache seeding it is expected to be slower than the say the results speak for usually edges out the adding a where clause dramatically decreases the access time even if a clause you know will evaluate to the sweet spot appears to be where id is not would love to see other perhaps with smaller tables or with where clauses against different fields than the field sure there are other variations i taken into

was my understanding that the microsoft tfs proxy needed to be installed on a windows server os with iis also installed on the you could of course use a virtual pc image on your xp machine but i suspect that might go against the same rules that prevent you from running a server on your remote alternative is a product called from teamprise i work is designed as a tfs proxy server for single person and is designed to work on client such as windows vista also with a price of it is less expensive than the microsoft tfs proxy has a retail licensing price comparable to another tfs server	
was the first language i ever did much i played with basic a bit in middle but never really did anything more substantial than a thinking of a number between 1 and i have a whole lot of trouble with but i in high an ap computer science class was and we used at the time board was doing the exam in they have since switched to i i think fine as a first language nearly in my long as you have a good i think you would get more out of you can play with stuff right in a so there is a lot more instant the language itself is also a lot more strict in its enforcement of language which will help you learn the way to do get in your way if you try to do something the wrong especially if you have a teacher to tell you what doing wrong and how to fix you will tend to develop some bad

what programming tools should are there any was the only language to come and even it was in two dialects and want to look at the fred fish collection or aminet for more as finding commercial compilers will be i limited to plain text are there ides and debugging pretty much back to ides are not readily i would look at something like dme macro also available on the fred fish collection or aminet it provides some basic macro construction facilities that will no tools are already can this are there free fred or like to learn a traditional could you reccomend it was written by chris a little but it should provide you with all that you need to get including the proper bindings and the language is compiled and runs at speeds comparable to should i use to compile language you or lattice c were the c compilers of the time you can find good with manx tending towards 16bit and lattice towards there were a few tiny there is 68k assembly neato instruction set a pascal possibly as well as dice free c but looking for something could you suggest tools i use to debug the suggested commercial tools are far and few going to have to dig through the public domain archives to find there any libraries i should aware such as gui libraries are all built is the name of the library that provides basic windowing will provide you with and will provide you with support for handing the unique approach to before you get that want to look at which was the heart soul of the it provides linked list message passing io and was heavily throughout the if you understand understand the innards of the rest of the in mind that the state of the system will look more like an embedded game as there will be no memory smp all of these things could not easily be added due to design constraints that were introduced just before the first amiga i seem to recall that the issue was surrounding how it would handle multiple processors and memory protection given that the entire microkernel runs in a cpu but not the magic number is which is a memory that address is the pointer to the exec is not only a microkernel but also a and with it you can bootstrap into the rest of the system via libraries that could not be located will automatically be loaded from disk via this is how the amiga dealt with the issue of portable code all of the code was written using offsets into a pointer to the of a library and there were no fixed other than address every library has a call table of 6 bytes per entry jump that then vectors off into the correct entry it was easy to write your own provided you had the correct format for your device drivers the structure of libraries and used the same concept to provide default if the names are slightly this information is off the top of my head from nearly 20 years things to running workbench from the winuae that was the last great i can access from my windows hard but want to go as much as like to code and compile it workbench if running winuae in a1200 sure if that the model of hardware it was a good budget but try setting it for a3000 if that was a nice machine before commodore had an application installed called it a if emacs is your i would look at some of the native and very a similar amiga aware that you can code with c but i want to learn a draco is for it has most of the bindings for compiles and officially a language given tied to a specific hardware very let everyone know how it turned

windows app has at its core a loop that looks something like 0 0 if handle the error and possibly the the operating ensure that messages are you probably early windows games used an alternate method instead of calling the blocking call and then call the main processing loop if there was no message to various forms of delays were used to try to get an adequate frame rate without taking there just a good enough timer to give a smooth frame it might not be necessary to explicitly write a loop that calls it possible now to get a smooth frame rate by using the timer pool timers in by and wrapped by i there were also issues with getting mouse and keyboard events in a timely we used direct keyboard and mouse access rather than depending on the message because the message loop was often too slow and sometimes would cause us to lose not written games in a number of and i know what is like as a games possible that input is still a the message queue simply fast enough to give the response that game developers so they bypass the message queue for critical

working on a project which is in serious need of some performance do i write a test that fails if my optimizations do not in improve the speed of the elaborate a problem is not discovering which parts to i can use various profiling and benchmarking tools for problem is using tests to document that a specific optimization did indeed have the intended it would also be highly desirable if i could use the test suite to discover possible performance regressions later suppose i could just run my profiling tools to get some values and then assert that my optimized code produces better the obvious problem with is that benchmarking values are not hard they vary with the local is the answer to always use the same machine to do this kind of integration if you would still have to allow for some fuzziness in the since even on the same hardware benchmarking results can how then to take this into maybe the answer is to keep older versions of the program and compare results before and this would be my preferred since mostly environment does anyone have experience with this i imagine it would only be necessary to keep one older version if all the tests can be made to pass if the performance of the latest version is at least as good as the former testing best practices when doing

works because you are following over you state that a customer model has many orders then rails expects there to be a field on the orders you have followed these conventions then rails will use them and will be able to build the necessary sql to find all the orders for a given you look at the file when you are developing your application you will be able to see the necessary sql being built to select all orders for a given does not create tables without you asking it the creation of tables is achieved by generating a migration which will tables for the fact that you create a customer model and then state within it that it will not create you an orders you will need to do that for yourself within a migration to create an orders within that migration you will need to either add a column or use the customer statement to get the field added to the orders

would advise against implementing your drawing objects as vcl you will not gain much from but some things would be much more difficult than when coding this on your controls are so for parallel diagonal lines one control would be on top of the at least generally mouse events reach only the topmost control in the something you would have to correct in your own lines should have the end points so the user knows where to grab them for moving or something a custom control does not provide so have to code would probably simply create a line object and implement all functionality for moving and deleting lines	
would agree with others that a database would be your best you really are generating such a huge amount of data that it would cause a performance you might want to create two tables one as a source and another as an system would insert new data into the real time and a batch job would periodically move data from there to the archive when performance is a you would query only the smaller real time if you actually needed to query across all the you would query a view that unions the real time and archive

would be interesting to know a little do you create the imageprotocol is it a local variable or a class member or do you allocate it in unmanaged memory with is it sent to the c directly as stack variable or as a really tricky it feels like the delegate data is moved around by the gc which causes the access the interesting thing is that the delegate data type is a reference data which stores its data on the gc this data contains things like the address of the function to call but also a reference to the object that contains the this should mean that even though the actual function code is stored outside of the gc the data that holds the function pointer is stored in the gc heap and can hence be moved by the i thought about the problem a lot last night but come up with a	
would be working on extracting the specific business logic code in the mfc app and sticking that stuff in a rather than trying to wrap up the whole might be making a false assumption here that it will take you less effort to wrap the mfc app up as a dll removing all the gui adding a dll main and modifying the build process to produce a than the effort to isolate the business logic code and put that in a new dll wrap the gui up as a dll you will need a pretty good understanding of the dependencies of the business logic code and how it is used by the so you may as well just cut that stuff	
would create a clr function for reason for this is that clr code is going to be much better at parsing apart the strings and can pass that information back as a which is what sql server is really good at clr function would return a series of records based on the parsed values the input id would then use a cross apply on each element in your

would definitely go with something closer to the second it does seem like more messages passed back and but if your application grows and you will be happy that built the application with small where is the logic to handle mundane tasks like switching between executing them and processing the data for algorithms operate on some kind of input or starting you would get this from your data access you need seed data or initialization what about saving your results to file and retrieving them for review i would think that you need to do this once your application expect that at first you will use file based if feeling up to later you can upgrade to a if you code against an abstracted data persistence you have to change business logic later to support the change from file to should use the strategy pattern to implement your this will allow you to change the implementation of your solver from genetic algorithm to your other algorithms without having to change the business logic for each business layer will see a isolver that takes and you will call you should be able to switch between the different versions without having to change your business layer logic closed the only difference in the way the business logic should interact with the algorithms should be in the and even you should consider using a factory

would use a binary tree if you want to be able to efficiently find something in a sorted just the same as in any other data structure choice is important in any it become less important in higher level except to the degree that the higher level language provides large libraries that incorporate thoughtful intelligent design that handles this for in which case you have to design the data structure but you do have to know which data structure to java collections framework is extensive and but if you make use of the wrong collections your performance will some data structures are more than memory is cheap and modern languages will manage memory for but if you are handling huge sets of then data structures will matter if you can make something more

you want to check for uniqueness in the query to ensure that something you can include a where clause using the mysql userid from tablea where can also use the distinct but this is similar to group by mysql docs say that it might even use group by behind the scenes to return the that you will only return 1 record if there are multiple records that have the same an if the uniqueness property is important to your application you want multiple records with the same value for a you can define the unique constraint on a this will make the insert query bomb out when you try to insert a duplicate you should understand that an error can occur on the and code your error checking logic

you want to take the and challenging i would suggest the you want to take something and challenge i would suggest taking the suggest skimming a short anecdote about my c programming experience that i wrote i learn the past 3 years i have been doing c only development as an electrical engineer and i have found the experience to be a c programmer you will find for performance and designing lots of low level building blocks that are taken for granted in higher level coding for doing some coding for performance and developing i will have to say that i am i find it really exciting and i find to be one of the most challenging and interesting implementing lots of low level building first i was very annoyed at having to implement my own low level but as time progressed i realized that it takes real skill to successfully implement something like a circular buffer that is fast and in the if i need to implement some fancy data structure with lots of dynamic memory usage and pointers i will easily be able low level implementation work also makes using any of the higher level work very very easy because once you have done low level work the high level stuff is memory almost forgot to mention this because in c you are forced to make decisions about memory every couple of and you even realize it after a basically this is probably one of the best parts of c because it forces you to think about how you are using memory always and as a result you become much much more proficient in using consider blocks to be more interesting and challenging than the higher level explain my opinion of higher level languages using my experience using higher level has been and because feel like a child who is given a box of legos to build something can build many things with legos and they can be very but you are to the tools in your lego resultant output sometimes a tendency to look similar to other lego process of building your lego output is not as challenging as building your own lego pieces and then building your project from your own obligatory warning about metaphors and how they are useful for getting a point across but not for completely explaining	
you want to test if the request was made using a post is the way to you want to find out if an array is there are some will check if a variable is php considers the following values to be empty 0 as an as a empty var variable but without a value in a is a language which means you use it as a so the following will also only checks so the following will fail with a fatal do something is also faster than but this make you consider it over the is a it will first cast the parameter to an and check if it is personally i would use this to check empty do something differs a little from because here will be cast to a and because empty arrays cast to it will achieve the same result as is a very big gotcha involved because of empty returns returns

you would have one comprehensive domain model for the you can use the domain model in your service layer or the controller if it is a small for your you can use presentation objects to make the views easier to these are sometimes also called dto or view model basically what you do is create an object that contains all the data from the model that is necessary for the view to be model may class public string class public string want the view to output the name and model of the car and you would have to pass both the car and driver model objects the than sending the two model objects directly from the controller to the you can create an object which contains just the data you class public string public string would populate this object from the domain data and pass that to the and the view would you have to worry about lazy loading issues or complicated view logic to deal with model more work to create these view model objects but they really help keep the view clean and provides an easy way to do formatting before sending data to the are projects and conventions you can use to help automate the creation of the view if you want to look into is an

your dlls to be you need to protect all shared data structures that multiple threads in one process could access concurrently there is no difference here between writing code for a dll writing code for an multiple processes there is no risk in concurrent as each process gets its own data segment for the so variables with the same name are actually different when seen from different it is actually much more difficult to provide data in a dll that is the same from different you would basically need to implement the same things you would use for data exchange between that a dll is special in that you get notifications when a process or a thread attaches to or detaches from a see the documentation for the callback for an and for an example how to use this in a so if your threads are not completely independent from each other no shared data is then you will need some shared data structures with synchronized the various notifications may help you with properly setting up any data structures in your your dlls allow for completely independent execution of the exported also do check out the note that for them and sections are not but maybe the thread notifications can help you there as
