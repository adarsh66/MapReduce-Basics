1 x y your and are very so is going to be smaller way too small to influence the results of your so as far as 1 x means you can store the numbers with 1 and instead of just add them as long as the results are always much less than be close enough to the mathematically precise results that you care about the just you say of them are very close to obviously this technique work for numbers that are not close to 1 that if and are but if one is large and one is it might still you only care about the magnitude of the product if both numbers are not close to you can just use regular java

a bit but hopefully getting you for classes are generally pretty easy to it mostly comes down to are created in a simple tree and in actionscript3 the filestructre has to follow the which makes it even can access any class from but if in another package you will need to the this is done by writing an import statement in the beginning of class or interface where you need to use like is an exception to this a class can be declared with the internal in which case the class will only be available within that this is mostly used for helper you should not worry about classes not being create package with the package

allocation use anything like it uses a piece of memory called program stack which is just a contiguous segment of a special register that stores the top of the when a new object is created on stack the top is raised thus increasing the when an object is deallocated out of the top is lowered thus decreasing the you try to allocate a too large object on stack or go too deep into recursion the top will outgrow the maximum allowed size of the stack and this is called stack actual direction of stack growth or decreasing vary by but general idea is the same regardless of actual

also worth noting that some programs behave differently when run by a user at the command vs being part of a batch from another the actual difference is whether a terminal attached to the spawn part of the expect extension to sets things up so the executed program sees itself as run by a and then adds functionality to allow the tcl program to interact with the external program in a convenient way matching output via regular expressions and branch off those things run via spawn are run exec command is a core tcl command that runs the other returning it does not do any of the complicated setup that spawn but can be very handy for just running a program and seeing output return things run by exec by run but an ampersand at the end of the command causes it to be run in the background like traditional shell open while generally used to can also be used to run external by preceding the command name with the pipe you tell it to run an external and gain access to file descriptors to interact with the resulting this is sort of a middle ground between exec and with much more interaction with the process but without the complicated environmental setup that spawn it can be extremely handy for interacting with programs that require input but are still fairly well setup for

an app to hit a web server 10 times a second is not a good web servers are designed for less frequent client requests and probably larger processing times and reponse sizes than your game will be not to say a web server be able to cope just that it would not be an efficient any type of app that requires multiple packets per second you really should think about a lighter protocol than http which is fairly for example if your game needs to send 4 bytes to register a battleship you really want to transmit an extra few hundred bytes of http recommend a browser plugin technology like siverlight of both of those support tcp socket you would need to write your own server to sit at the other end of the tcp with that approach also have the advantage of being able to push data out to the clients without having to rely on client polling mechanisms which are required with

answers bring up the legality of the thing or lack i am not so sure making a local copy of a website strictly for personal use constitutes copyright of there is no mention of where the person is so we even know what copyright laws for canada and australia have some explicit positions regarding personal use of lawfully acquired and i believe there are a few rulings in the us along the same by visiting a you are automatically making a personal copy using a software called a this is i a copyright the user use an offline browser of some kind to visit the website and store it on his hard i do not see why this would be prohibited in and context are also if you consider that most websites are archived and made publicly available by the wayback machine an usage which is not challenged is based in the it is pretty difficult to make a valid argument against a private copy intented as a personal i think making a personal copy of a website for strictly private use is a violation of current copyright laws in most the other distributing the said copy would be a different matter	
answers you got so far are i think however that you are mixing things in your question that belong so not possible to completely answer your question title states settings db these can be two quite different you have to differentiate between files that are files that are common for all users but and common files that every user should be able to work first category is use a suitable directory under one of the or second category is also files just need to be installed in the proper location by the setup which must be run with proper because standard users will not be able to write to the correct last category however is because there simply a directory in all windows installations that can be assumed to be writeable for all especially in business settings with user accounts it can be that the user has no write permissions for the local disc at only to their user directory somewhere on a server in the so there is no single simple way to grab that data location for your program and be sure it will work something you will possibly have to revisit for all programs and all use cases bonus points you should also always consider whether the files should go into the roaming profile and be available on all machines in a or whether they are tip i would give is to move away from desktop style database files like paradox or access files for applications that need to share data between users on a only with real database servers will you be able to have data on accounts

are about solving it matter whether talking about the tools in a wood shop or a what impressed me about rails still is that it was extracted from framework used to build web apps and has repeatedly been improved by people who extended or changed it after using it to build web it was no mere academic of the specific problems it started if you are looking to get a web application underway what better choices could you have than a framework that specifies an existing directory structure based on with lots of code and choices already for you as to components like javascript testing you may not agree with all the choices but you can assume them and have something that will work for or more of projects and swap out something later if you have a term migrations give you ways to move data forward as your code something that happens in any yet most frameworks do not account for that at separating all of the parts of your application into a directory hierarchy already setup with areas for again aids the long term maintenance of your human configuration files give you extra opportunities for human logical once learned can avoid mistakes like the classic mistyped file name or class name in a configuration file of different modes of rails has built in support for the idea of having a different set of settings for development test real apps have this but often the framework around them accommodate it and you end up having to swap configuration files in and out to achieve the same effect human error several things mentioned above embrace and encourage good programming practices standardized project but rails is often explicit in encouraging them and not just for evidence of that you need look no further than its built in support for test driven

are at least two important of is based on the unicode standard for and sorts accurately in a very wide range of comes very close to correct unicode sorting in many common but has a number of inaccuracies in some languages making in unsuitable for correct sorting in those is faster at comparisons and because it takes a bunch of uses a much more complex comparison algorithm which aims for correct sorting according in a very wide range of this makes it slower to sort and compare large numbers of defines complex sets of rules for how characters should be these rules need to take into account not everybody sorts their characters in what we would call far as latin languages there is not much difference between the unicode sorting and the simplified sorting in but there are still a few the unicode collation sorts like and like as people using those characters would normally whereas sorts them as single characters like and such as asian languages or languages with different there may be a lot differences between unicode sorting and the simplified the suitability of will depend heavily on the language for some be quite unicode characters are defined as which means they count toward the sort order and the comparison should move on to the next character handles these should you is almost never any reason to use as we have left behind the point where cpu speed is low enough that the performance difference would be your database will almost certainly be limited by quite other bottlenecks than this the difference in performance is only going to be measurable in extremely specialised and if already know about if experiencing slow in almost all cases be an issue with your changing your collation function should not be high on the list of things to i originally wrote this answer 4 years i said that if you you could use most of the and only use when sorting was going to be important enough to justify the performance the performance cost is no longer really relevant it may not have been back more important to sort properly in whichever language your users are other thing add is that even if you know your application only supports the english it may still need to deal with which can often contain characters used in other languages in which it is just as important to sort using the unicode rules for everything helps add peace of mind that the very smart unicode people have worked very hard to make sorting work

are some things to think you want to cast or you want the result as a or an the result is an do you want the to be applied lazily the will not actually occur until the iterator reaches each distinction between since a casting operator often involves constructing a new and could be considered a implementations should automatically apply conversion operators defined for the types new object may or may not be implementations should allow one to specify a method implementations using existing suppose you pass as input a that you want to convert with any of the previous can return only a lazy also fails to use existing explicit cast because such a cast possible in for a generic type parameter says unless toutput has an explicit conversion operator defined for to this confusion is what lead to this topic in the first the cast to a generic type parameter not possible in this requires a as input instead of just an new would be except reflection is and must be used since hides the method name for explicit operators making it difficult to obtain a delegate any other methods should involve defined explicit conversion or allow one to specify a conversion language specification for conversion operators specifically their lack of a method name makes it difficult to obtain a delegate except through the alternative is to encapsulate or replicate the conversion increasing the complexity of your code since conversions are implicit in the presence or absence of conversion and should be handled by the we should not have to manually search for definitions of appropriate conversion operators with reflection at on the types methods for conversions using explicit conversion operators should really be a framework and with they except the language spec makes it hard to get a delegate for the conversion operators

asked a question that was specific to a but now i find myself wondering about the topic in the broad we have two a and where b is derived from b truly and all of the routines defined in a have the same meaning in say we want to display a list of some of which are actually as we traverse our list of if the current object is actually a we want to display some of bs additional maybe we just want to color the bs but neither a nor b have any notion of or the a class of b by basically including a method called in a that returns b will override the method and return display code would have a check if b b a method in a that b can but then we start merging the ui and the i consider this unless there is some cool trick not instanceof to check if the current a object to be displayed is really a add all the junk from b to even though it apply to basically just contain a b does not inherit from in a and set it to null until it this is somewhat this is similar to i guess composition over seems like this particular problem should come up from time to time and have an obvious i guess the question maybe really boils down i have a subclass that extends a base class by additional just changing the existing behavior of the base am i doing something tragically it all seems to instantly fall apart as soon as we try to act on a collection of objects that may be a or on base or subclass without rtti or base class

at this like to take a moment to speak to you about the adobe psd is not a good psd is not even a bad calling such would be an insult to other bad such as pcx or is an abysmal having worked on this code for several weeks hate for psd has grown to a raging fire that burns with the fierce of a million if there are two different ways of doing psd will do different it will then make up three more ways no sane human think and do those psd makes inconsistency an art did it suddenly decide that particular chunks should aligned to four and that this alignement should be included the other chunks in other places are either or aligned the alignment included in the it is not one of these three behaviours would be a sane format would pick of uses all and trying to get data out of a psd file is like trying to find something in attic of your eccentric old uncle who died in a freak freshwater attack on his 58th that last detail may not be important for purposes of the but at this point i am spending a lot of imagining amusing fates for the people responsible for this rube goldberg a file i tried to get a hold of the latest specs for the psd file to do i had to apply to them for permission to apply to them to them consider sending me this sacred this would have involved them a copy of some document or probably signed in i can imagine that they make this process so difficult because they are ashamed of having created this i was naturally not enough to go through with this but if i had done i would printed out every single page of the and set them all on were within my i would gather every single copy of those and them on a spaceship directly into the psd is not my favourite file

attempting to compile a working copy of the class library using the sources from the imagemagick and magicknet was unable to obtain a copy of the magicknet source files from the homepage as it is currently so i was forced to obtain the files and project file from courtesy of a google the instructions stated and i created a project using the option and compiled before moving to the magicknet project file and compiling that as after making sure all the paths pointed to the right i keep receiving this error upon error already defined in also receive 371 other all of them related to an external symbol and a final 372nd error describing that i have unresolved managed to solve the dllmain error above by commenting out the dllmain declaration from the source file from the project in the imagemagick however the 372 other errors still had performed a search for people with similar and have said that the author had offered a download of a magicknet dll which works however i mentioned his homepage appears to be inaccessible currently seeking one of these solution to my compilation as i may be making a mistake on my part since not familiar with at link to another magicknet source zip that is confirmed to compile correctly with the latest version of link to a working precompiled copy of the magicknet if anyone kept a copy from the it should be approximately 3mb as it contains the imagemagick libraries as would really appreciate any one of these as i desperately require ability to manipulate and convert as well as ease of i can provide additional details if you need more i am using visual studio 2008 to compile the source and the supplied projects convert with no issues at source compilation

been doing web development for a while and fairly competent in lately learnt java and fallen in love with and really like to do more java work gotten my first opportunity with a client who needs a web web app and he has agreed to let me use anything i want including i done any web in java only went through the java learnt a bit about applets and build a 2d pacman and have done some simple work in web need to get started with this project in the next days so i have much time to read long books about the this is what learnt so a tomcat on my dev machine to work with the basics of the and a mini mvc app which displays a html lets you pick something from a dropdown and when you hit it retrieves your submitted value through in the and then forwards on to a jsp page which shows which value you think these are the next few things need to to and more about the syntax of jsp seem to be hundreds of topics about java web dev which i know anything but i have time to learn i need someone to point out any other crucial things need to in order to build this web app perhaps 20 using java and google web coming from a background which is an mvc framework in php that makes things like form sessions management uses database and common tasks like these very if there is a lightweight framework in java that can take care of things like please mention it as do i need to learn to build a web app in

been playing around with the code contracts some more myself on a small but moderately complex standalone which needs to inherit from some bcl classes and use other contracts thing seems great when working in a completely isolated environment with just your own code and primitive but as soon as you start using bcl classes until do not have their own the verifier cannot check whether they will violate any of the and so you get a lot of warnings about potentially unsatisfied the other it does find some invalid or potentially unsatisfied constraints which could be real but very hard to find these because there is so much noise that hard to find out which ones you can possible to suppress the warnings from the bcl classes by using the assume but this is somewhat as these classes will have contracts in the future and assumptions will lessen their my feeling is that for because in trying to build on a framework that the verifier does not sufficiently that probably worth waiting for	
been reading a lot lately about the next release of java possibly supporting i feel like i have a pretty firm grasp on what closures but i think of a solid example of how they would make an language most people who use the term actually mean and in this function objects make it possible to write simpler code in certain circumstances such as when you need custom comparators in a sort in return y sorts the list a in reverse order by passing the custom comparison functoin the addition of the lambda operator makes things even more y y does not have function so it uses to simulate in java you do the equivalent operation by implementing a custom version of the comparator and passing that to the sort reversecomparator implements comparator public object return y a new you can it gives the same effect as but is clumsier and more the addition of anonymous inner classes obviates most of the a reverse new public object return y i would say that the combination of functor classes anonymous inner classes in java is sufficient to compensate for the lack of true function making their addition	
been searching for a way to lets say dynamic created objects at runtime by iterating though them and there so far played with using reflections and foreach to illiterate the class this is to display all records in various tables on a data grid one approach i think is to use mapping to populate a dataset and then be able to display it on the data grid view for editing maybe iterating over the actually namespace of all the classes inherit a class called table so i guess there should be a method in invoking all classes at to fetch the data from the done mostly java programming up until now so have a good idea of just not so familiar with so looking for the best approach in in reflection and collections to illiterate a object rational

believe the factory method design pattern is appropriate for what trying to but not sure how much responsibility of subclasses it to give the example of using the method at wikipedia describes the situation in almost class imagereaderfactory public static imagereader inputstream is int imagetype is imagetype case return new is case return new is question what does the function look in this specific i would assume that it checks a file header in the to determine which image format the data is i would like to know if the itself knows how to parse file headers and determine if the file type is or if it calls a function inside each class that lets it know what type of image it something like return else return seems like having the factory know how to parse images breaks and letting the subclasses decide which one should be created is part of the factory method design it also seems like the function is just adding some redundant because why not just have each subclass perform its check on the in the function and skip the switch had any experience using factories and i was hoping to get some insight from some people who have used them in the past on the best way to handle this is it okay to have the factory know about the inner workings of its or should they be responsible for letting the factory know which to and how do you organize it does a factory know which type of object to

browser has a provider this is basically a chain of classes that get called in a particular order for each for example we providers new order of the providers in the list is higher order providers take precedence over lower order i have tried to make this portion so a third party dll can define its own providers that will get injected in our problem is that once you allow for 3rd parties to inject themselves in the chain you lose a central place to define this current solution that i am a little uncomfortable with is to define a optional priority attribute with each provider and then order by the for example i now allows 3rd parties to define their position in the solutions i thought about were before and after attribute imagefrommedialocationprovider i am not sure if this is easier or harder to program there any other solutions to this which solution would you go i should just keep the list for the core providers and add the attribs for third party providers way to annotate provider

but still believe there is something to add to the superb advice given so to answer your question we need to go a level hence the long been made a tech lead responsible for team and although many aspects of your everyday job might seem to resemble your dev days the way you need to go about them has in software development environment there is usually not that much of a tangible change when you appointed a tech lead probably still seating at the same wearing the same as opposed to becoming a foreman on construction site or a the flattering change though is that you now get invited into all these meeting and start getting all these and phone calls from people outside the dev lack of tangible change might trick your mind into thinking that you just need to keep treating your job mostly the this is not the case and you need to be conscious about your actions and in the new it might seem now a bit externally and you might be inclined to share some of that coming your way play a bit of democracy and generally be this is not that much about fairness or the new job is the dev team by personal example and creating imagery depicting the an abstraction layer between the team and other organisational much like in programming you often create an abstraction layer to encapsulate and hide the same happens in the the interface that has to encapsulate the dev and any good encapsulation from an outsider point of inner complexity that is not relevant to the task at hand as concrete implementation of an from the outside things that could affect the outside user explicit that can be any limitations and constraints gives meaningful principles are equally applicable to the outward not an easy task to follow these actually it involves a lot of concrete such as deciding what details are internal and what facts need to be communicated and how the feedback needs to be best structured and be presented in a consistent manner and who should be notified externally of and who needs to followed up and this is a lot of even if some of it seems to be just trivial to inward one way is to but it clogs the internal network and everyone has to spend their time on deciding whether the communication bears any relevance to it is like having a very generic algorithm that regardless of input always does the exact same amount of sure but why would you want to do a more efficient way is obviously to adjust processing depending on the input and here it has to be job to make a decision how the team should go about to or convert the what sequence of actions needs to be just acknowledge and store for future follow put an issue off for a later review and then make sure it is reviewed and fed back into the is not a small job either and someone has to do obviously now your job to manage the outward and inward and you have to spend some of your processing power to do it so no one else has to and devs can concentrate on their are some other good reasons for not or everyone regardless of your job means cc note for future bcc or mass you should be careful when you use one or another a group of a single person is a straight forward when a group of people only these who you need to take action a simple this is default in any other case explicitly tell them what is expected no action needed only these who you want to take note of the information for the future if you expect a number of to go back and forth before an agreement is reached or issue is resolved best to send a summary confirmation later to other parties that need to be besides saving time and avoiding misinterpretation due to someone taking note of a communication that will help make exchange more flow more and reduce formalism and often treated formally and this always a good thing sometimes exactly what you bcc is almost never the knowledge of someone eavesdropping on your conversations if come to light will easily ruin your it is simply a question of and should your team worry then that you might be their conversations to someone mass mailing through bcc in most cases is also it creates an impression that is specifically addressed to the and require little but multiply noise and dilutes it is worth to give some thought to what exactly you need a person to do and what they should know to act on your communication before composing conversations are best taken completely or better still because it gives you more room for broadcasting or formalising in writting is just like putting yourself into a you can always confirm in writing to the second part of a tech lead responsibility the team through personal example and imagery depicting the to accomplish that you need to pass on to the team every single piece of information that happen to end in your you have to create a story and any good story is an abstraction of real events that consists of only relevant and interesting detail for a particular creating this brief story on the basis of your everyday experience and judging what is relevant and interesting and then presenting it regularly to the team is also quite a forget that by directing the team and serving as abstraction layer you help developers and outside world to interact more accomplish more and tackle greater the job has a

can also do this in some occasions makes the issue it is a big is that you lose all the typesafety of using a and you have to deal with the case where the method does not does have the that you can ignore access restrictions and call private methods shown in the but you can call methods that the compiler would normally not let you it is a rare case that this makes but on those occasions it is a nice tool to public static void throws final string final method final main main new methodname methodname method private void int private void int private void method final int throws

can be appropriate when the pointer itself can be regarded as a that a piece of data whose internal representation should be irrelevant to the if your code will dereference the and you just pass it around api functions by then not only does the typedef reduce the number of in your but also suggests to the programmer that the pointer really be meddled also makes it easier to change the api in the future if the need for instance using an id rather than a pointer vice since the pointer was never supposed to be dereferenced in the first existing code	
can be done with a worst case of less than 32 checking for 2 or more bits is just as efficient as checking for 1 for example nothing stopping you from checking for which grouping its in then checking each bit from smallest to biggest in that you check 2 bits at a time you have in the worst case 1 checks you check 3 bits at a time you have in the worst case 2 checks would be to check in groups of which would require in the worst case 11 operations instead of your best case goes from your 1 check though to 2 checks if you use this grouping but that extra 1 check in best case is worth it for the worst case i write it out in full instead of using a loop because more efficient that int bits return else return else return return bits return else return else return return bits return else return else return return bits return else return else return return bits return else return else return return bits return else return else return return bits return else return else return return bits return else return else return return return

cannot define constructor signatures in that make sense anyway since the interface enforce how the implementations are classes though can indeed have they must be protected since public constructors does not make sense they should only be called by concrete ioc principle dictates that instead of having class a know about and instantiate class you should instead pass in a reference to ib to the constructor of then a will not need to know about class b and thus you can easily substitute class b with some other implementation of passing in an already instantiated object of class the ib interface need to have a constructor

commented on post that i feel his answer is the if the goal is just to avoid two database then just in for a world of unnecessary your reference to if you are looking instead for a solution to that allows you to defer official saving in some you may wish to have a look at the function in the inner function is how the delayed save is accomplished for implementing something for models without forms would basically follow the same said and coming back to the case of a modelform and an actual model are somewhat because forms expose only a set of data to be edited in a browser because it is filtered in some or excludes critical fields that a user be it is a reasonable design expectation that someone might need to add important information to the model before this is why django has the expectation falls down for cases where you are directly instantiating here you have programmatic access to the model so you will probably find that using that api directly is easier to maintain and less error prone than through generalized i can understand why you are picturing the factory but in this case you may find the effort to create a generalization for all manner of models is a complication just not worth

company is looking to replace all websites in the group with a new system and similar with functionality being added in a future too big a job for me to do in a reasonable so we are going to be inviting tenders from currently in the process of defining the technical and intending to dictate that the selected system must have a strict doctype and must trigger standards mode almost standards in common or something to that effect have to allow almost standards mode to cater for done a bit of homework an all of this i want the spec to be limited by my after all but it surprise you all that found that is completely divided on what is good are plenty of people who advocate strict plenty of people who recommend strict served as ok with this some who recommend html5 restricted to still not sure if this is a good idea or but i see the but also a number people on other so who recommend just understand the reasoning for you may happen to want to temporarily use something that been and thus transitional seems but some people recommend xhtml transitional for new checking out other sites for design notice that many sites they have any doctype specified at will refer to a transitional we all know there is plenty of crap on the so perhaps i draw too many but checking out web design agencies that come there are an amazing proportion of them vast majority of i would are using xhtml so you necessarily have to be an expert to call yourself a web but the sheer volume of transitional layouts makes me most of the sites seem to be otherwise reasonably designed accessible having finally got to the is there some reason why such a large proportion of these agencies are opting for transitional am i missing something that i need to consider for my new i realise the purpose of the transitional dtd i was just suspicious that so many web developers are clinging on to deprecated i wonder if you guys are correct and the answer is simply that they are are too lazy to get their own website to or sticking with the default dtd of their preferred key for me is that to your responses so i seem to be missing out on some key reason to use a transitional regarding our cms project all the agencies thankfully seem to have their heads screwed on valid and is xhtml transitional so

created a set of javabean annotations working on a new version right so the trunk code match the update site them can be quite usually approach it by creating a project in eclipse with the test code and building then make a copy and turn off annotation can then use eclipse to compare the test project to the copy of the have too many test cases yet very tedious to generate so many combinations of but this is annotations in a build system is actually very take a look at for an example of how used in an ant and using it in eclipse is just a matter of making a plugin specifying the annotation processor extension and turning on annotation processing in projects that want to use used annotation processing in a continuous build building the annotations then using it in the rest of the really pretty found this to be an issue be careful of what you do in the i generate a lot of code in mine and it runs a little slower in that java6 processors can run a little faster because they are part of the normal compilation had trouble getting them to work properly in a code generation capacity think much of the problem is support and running for i stick with java is one of the things in the annotation the api has a object that handles all each ide provides an implementation that converts this into appropriate error messages at the right location in the only thing i did was to cast the processing environment object so i could check if it was bring run as a build or for editor if i eventually change this to just do error checking at edit time so it can report errors as you be though you need to keep it fast for use during reconciliation or editing gets generation a little more per annotation processor specifications state that you are not allowed to modify the class that contains the i suspect this is to simplify the processing rounds do not need to include the annotated preventing infinite update loops as generate other and they recommend that generate a superclass for all of the methods and anything else i need to i also have the processor verify that the annotated class extends the generated for class foo extends generate a class in the same package with the name of the annotated class plus and verify that the annotated class is declared to extend have seen someone use the compiler tree api to modify the annotated class this is against spec and i suspect plug that hole at some point so it would recommend generating a happy using annotation very well especially looking at build i would recommend sticking with the java5 annotation processors if doing code generation you need to run a separate tool called apt to process then do the that the api for java 5 and java 6 annotation processors is the java 6 processing api is better but i just had luck with java 6 processors doing what i need java 7 comes out give the new processing approach another free to email me if you have this

currently fighting with the viewstate and it is starting to wear me having found that some of the pages in one of our applications is made up of around viewstate i have looked into reducing this where i have looked at am happy disabling viewstate for controls that do not need it buttons and have made some small gains now looking at viewstate compression and while i can demonstrate a decrease in size it does not seem to be playing well with my contains a few dropdown a button and a grdiview the need to deal with the when the page loads the ddls are populated and default selections are pressing the ok button results in the gridview being populated as the with viewstate compression if the user changes the selected items in the ddls before clicking the ok button they will get a field error indicating that a selection has not been made in one of the ddls but this is not the disabling the compression code removes the problem and the page operates as expected as it has for the problem be down to the viewstate now being stored in a key other than code that i have seen use different key names vstate for page sources look like source with compression the empty source without does know where the viewstate is stored and does it know that i have moved i need to make any other changes to my code apart from implementing savepagestatetopersistencemedium and got to the bottom of this well i have it some reason using the method appears to have been the source of the modifying the code to utilise the base class save and processing the pair object returned by i now have a working test show a reduction of aroun on the test page so pretty happy with that i have compression working i need to recommend that the next code review has a focus on removing viewstate where it is not to eveyone who responded to my cry for help saved me a few grey hairs compression issues

currently trying to get openvg up and running on my the problem comes i am will be developing an application for a windows ce device compact which has opengl es and openvg on ti if the application will definitely use openvg for and likely opengl for some effects if openvg offer them like to develop on my desktop without the emulator so i thought i just import openvg with which was quite since the openvg people made their constants into real and though a procedural c it translated very well into an form a graphics class for drawing and stroke and image i also managed to get going with named dlls and entry and i imported egl also quite easy to translate to an this it sounded quite i thought just use the openvg reference implementation from but it is really you like clearing the surface taking literally a so i openvg is a just take one of the other most of them are based on which is what i or creating an opengl es surface with egl with the powervr windows emulation sdk for opengl es is not compatible with any openvg implementation i some of them require traditional opengl the egl version supplied by powervr support most implementations even have egl and use some bizarre functions to initialize the context all of them assuming that an opengl context has already been not opengl only one i could get to work was amanithvg which is very fast for a software implementation and does not rely on opengl or it but it is still far too slow for real time believe that these things feel so really tempted to just use for which powervr supplies an emulation layer for desktop in the hope that the final board support package will supply direct3d as an opengl es like it seems to be on many the there any openvg implementation for windows desktop systems that works with opengl es bonus points if it works smoothly with opengl es emulation and the supplied egl should i just try to use a traditional opengl implementation on the but typically not supplying egl as i want to have two initialization layers and or should this is not a because the problem is the very same without openvg implementation on desktop based on opengl

decent sized project to be really successful over the long term needs to perform the steps you but not necessarily in the manner described that you must do look at happening in the market and a huge trend of moving towards as well as test driven these more and tie everything together as a natural part of every project members daily working my personal experience is that having a in a document somewhere means that someone has to maintain one mistake and the trail starts to become you end up with process descriptions which are a list of which inevitably become impossible to piece back is where a is documents are actually linked to via a from which they are checked in and out there are approval in the system along with audit tests are written and automated as much as running of the tests is tracked and even if there are processes for test escapes to make there way back into the process from the requirements code is built against tests and escapes the source code management system is tied to this central repository and no change to the code is unless it can be linked is full end to end traceability through the the systems are structured so that people interacting with it will find it easier to do their jobs and have less to worry many companies used atlassian subversion hooks to fisheye and cruise control to provide these these systems are far from perfect but much much better than the riduculous manual process of someone responsible for maintain a table in every one of 2000 even microsoft project implemented can be used to do this today and provide a single site where all come together for about is that cost even on a small

delegate methods in your controller and call them from your instead and send to your the values change rather when the user interacts with your your view is used to get some form of input from the then subclassing is a better the iphone reference is the base class for objects such as buttons and sliders that are used to convey user intent to the the most important distinction between and is whether user intent is conveyed or is meant to display while is meant to collect user you decide to go with the delegate how your code might look your custom define delegate like myview uiview id id it in the your view set the controller to be the myview whenever the user interacts with the view example in possibly changing the do this in the possibly change the might also want to take a look at and data in the cocoa fundamentals berk berk

depends on what is important to your you short change but if you you should also ask yourself this your application there to handle or does the data transcend your other if the code part of your application blew up but your data is still how bad of a disaster would it if you answer can always write the code to replace the but without the you had better make sure that your data is because it will probably outlive any code you write not to say you put a great amount of effort into writing a solid but the code is ultimately transient whereas your data is if stuck with bad you can but if you have bad it will likely have much broader the other if the data is really only there to make sure that your code works and the code itself is more important inverse of the above you should ensure that you have a good and revisit any deficiencies in the data most enterprise the data are far more i have worked on conversion projects in the past where the code was far past its but migration was delayed for so long because the data was so bad that it took a significant and very discretionary effort to get the data to a point of health where it could be

easy method of doing this your service runs in the same process as the is to use a shared preferences the activity can write to the preferences file whenever a radio button is and the service can either register a listener on the preferences or check the state whenever writing to the more complicated way which avoids preferences would be for the service to be started with that it remains running even if the activity is not and then for the activity to call the service if it is not to return an ibinder stub it can communicate for this i recommend you look at the api

emphasis on the first point that jon the more immutable state that you have globals that are the easier your life is going to be the fewer locks have to deal the less reasoning have to do about interleaving often times if you have small objects to which you need multiple threads to have sometimes better off copying it between threads rather than having a mutable global that you have to hold a lock to a tradeoff between your sanity and memory

exercise tells you to write two one that computes means of a recursive and another that computes means of an iterative you did the recursive since this function is very similar to the function given in the examples of the section you linked you should be able to figure this out by looking at the recursive and iterative examples of the n n n n 1 0 a b count a a count this case you would define an function which would take and arguments as well as a is the notice the similarity to a b c count a 2 3 a b count through a little trial and i found that and should be initialized to and which also follows the pattern of the function initializing and to and so looks like 2 1 0 is still a recursive but because of the way scheme it runs as an iterative and runs in time and unlike your code which is not only a recursive function but a recursive i believe this is what the author of exercise was looking	
exi xml is going to be claims to be last binary is a standard to store xml data optimized and is bundled with xml schema the typed and strongly there are a lot i was impressed most by the processing am asking what is going to happen to all the is this paragraph related to my existing xml processing exi is an encoding of the xml an exi implementation can support any of the xml apis for xml so exi has no immediate impact on existing xml using an existing xml api also requires that all names and text appearing in the exi document be converted into in the more efficiency might be achievable if the higher layers could directly use these data as typed values appearing in the exi for if a higher layer needs typed going through its string form can produce a performance so an extended api that supports typed data directly could improve performance when used with understand it as exi with existing performance you rewrite them take the java ecosystem as an have plenty of xml apis in latest jdk each major jdk more and more of them were far as i can most not of them are using dom or serialized xml do you guys what is going to happen to with introduction of you all for your those who know xml are xml apis

hard to give a good answer without a little more kind of performance do you linear is fine then i would just use a list of dates and iterate through the list collecting all dates that fall within the as you have duplicates in the you need to have repeated dates in your collection then most implementations of a binary tree would probably be something like treeset are set implementations and allow repeated are the access lots of lookups with few or fairly datastructures have between lookups and if doing lots of updates then some datastructure that are optimized for lookups be so what are the access characteristics of the data what kind of performance do you and what are structural characteristics that it must support must allow repeated

have a templatefield that is dynamically added to a custom switch case if image himg new for label l new case case case qlimagebutton deletebutton new response to a grid command a method called getrowcontrols is called which iterates through the columns in the particular and adds each of its controls to a this works fine for both template field and bound controls added as well as template fields added when the control is a templatefield control added dynamically is always null and therefore the statement above throws an looked into this with reflector because i found that when i examined the variable in the immediate window in vs 2005 would list a since established that this is because in listing in the immediate the proprty clientid is called and clientid calls which in turn sets virtual string string uniqueid if return return assuming that uniqueid and id are all null although as above just reading the first two will trigger all to be also note that namingcontainer is not it has been the work around for this is quite simple check for and if so simply read and thats what done because time wise really got to get a wriggle but still interested in the answer if anyone knows it off the top of their is the id value of a child of a dynamically added set at a different time from that of other does a control in a programmatically added templatefield have id property

have been dropping hints at a version of office with an integrated vsto in the same way as the vb6 ide is integrated for so the vs ide would be integrated for ever since was first just how much coding is involved and given that this would not produce any features that would be visible to users i very much doubt that this is high on the microsoft priority i can imagine that they layer a managed code set of objects over the top of the existing codebase as joel spolsky layered a set of com objects over the existing c codebase when putting vba into excel in the first and bung a new ide in as the while hiding the old even that would be a major exercise writing the macro of this would make a for which the office team will only accept at will never actually remove vba from the of course excel still supports excel 4 and word still has the wordbasic automation object to support word 6 and no sign of either of those being since there is too much legacy code to support and has used either of those coding models in a microsoft do ever put a environment into office i doubt will ever then they might stop adding vba support for new office the closest get to discontinuing

have implemented so far 3 variants for the sweep algorithm for detecting the intersection of a planar closed i have big data that represent the graph 200 edges or the vertices are pairs of points in 2d the edges are a pair of two one being the source the other being the which is read from another function implemented in a library for some other problem is that the 3 implementation work fine on integers or doubles data that are not as but when i tried anyone of these 3 implementations on my datas representing the graph i got different result each time and not even the good i have all the intersections that i want but some other points from the graph are not i have some points from the graph as result but some intersections that i need are missing from the computed i have just the intersections all depends on the sort function that i had i saw and maybe on something else but i cannot figure it the sort function orders the edges of the graph as two edges as and or and and thought this sort function is good for monoticity and other cases but apparently it is working only for some cases when besides the regular intersections it detects some other intersections for some cases it does work at all in that it does not computes all the intersections but just some point from the you in

have read a ton of posts and articles about all of these languages and the good and bad of i realize that some folks will say another language and frankly i i am genuinely curious about this and i think it is an interesting question for healthy i would like to learn a language that will teach good programming fundamentals while also allowing to get something up ultimately i would like to be able to create sites and web it would also be nice to be able to find some work in the event that i ever reach a level of expertise where that may be a started and switched between several platforms and one problem with a few was all of the required components and modules that were required from different vendors with aptana and zend caused some issues in setting one thing that i really liked about the platform is that it is a cohesive environment with lots and lots of documentation that all works together quite i know that the possibility exists for some cost issues down the road though not sure how applicable this would be to a with smaller while i think is a great language that would teach good is it realistic to gain some level of competence in a shorter period of time given also looked at java and it seemed like it may be overkill for what trying to do though i state that with any seems like a great web development language that a lot of huge sites have been built with but one concern that i keep hearing over and over is the tendency to fall into poor habits with it this is a possibility with all i want one that minimized that potential given a reasonable amount of cost issues seem to be much less of an issue with php and it seems to be ubiquitous with heard great things about python and i went through some tutorials but it seems that been such a pain in the ass getting it to work as a cohesive system the way i know django is supposed to be great but it was also a pain in the ass to get seems enjoyable to learn but does teach the fundamentals the best does it matter in the end if it gets me going plus there seem to be a lot of jobs the way there are with php and would at least be nice to be able to do some freelance work at some is a highly subjective question so apologies for that as well as the length of any help would be much teetering on the verge of concentrating on one of several languages and your guidance would really what language should i learn for web development that allows a novice to get up reasonably quickly and teaches good habits such that it would be somewhat easy to pick up new and php for learning fundamentals and

hbase documentation makes it clear that you should group similar columns into column because the physical storage is done by column what does it mean to put two column families into the same as opposed to having separate tables per column are there specific cases when tables this way makes more and cases when one table works tables should result in separate which could be beneficial when some column families a are very when would it be advantageous to have columns families bunched spreading column families across tables or	
headers is the origin server sending back with your in order to be cacheable by i believe you generally have to specify either a or etag in the response web servers will typically do this automatically for static but if your content is being dynamically served if from a static then you have to ensure they are and handle request headers such as and since i got pointed to this question by your subsequent question about is there a header coming out in the for tells caches that the content can vary according to the cookie header in the so static content wants to have that but your web server might be adding that to all requests if there is a regardless of the nature of the data being my some experimentation with the http headers to see what the effects are on caching is of great i remember finding that the solutions were not always

help on defining display and currency ensure that an application behaves the same in whichever country it is datawindow expressions and the masks used in display formats and edit masks require notation for that when you specify a number in a datawindow expression or in a number a comma always represents the thousands delimiter and a period always represents the decimal you should also always use the sign to represent the symbol for the locally correct symbols are displayed for numbers and the comma and period are replaced by the delimiters defined in the number settings in the regional or international settings property sheet in the windows control the sign in the mask is replaced by the local currency symbol as defined in the currency setting in the windows control for in countries where a comma represents the decimal place and a period represents users see numbers in those is probably not the answer you were hoping to what i can suggest is use a computed field that will format the number any way you and display it as a input use the currency the user will probably feel more comfortable working with the default system locale

i have been playing a game on my iphone called some of you may know this game as when the game starts you get a matrix of letters like x i m l w b s t goal of the game is to find as many words as you can that can be formed by chaining letters you can start with any and all the letters that surround it are fair and then once you move on to the next all the letters that surround that letter are fair for any previously used so in the grid for i could come up with the words words must be at least 3 and no more than nxn which would be 16 in this game but can vary in some while this game is fun and i am apparently not very good at it and i wanted to cheat a little bit by making a program that would give me the best possible words longer the word the more points you not very good with algorithms or their efficiencies and so my first attempt uses a dictionary as this and does a linear search trying to match combinations with dictionary this takes a long time to find the possible and since you only get 2 minutes per it is simply not am interested to see if any stackoverflowers can come up with more efficient i am mostly looking for solutions using the big 3 and although anything with java or is cool since speed is php am adding a bounty to this question as my way of saying thanks to all the people who pitched in with their unfortunately i can only give the accepted answer to one of so measure who has the fastest boggle solver 7 days from now and award the winner the thanks to everyone that to find list of possible words from a letter matrix

i think you are approaching this pun not intended with an unnecessary degree of i think this unnecessary level of abstraction is what is causing the you are perhaps approaching this from a mathematical theoretical where many of us are approaching this from a trying to solve i believe this difference in approach is causing the programmers look at practicalities and how to actually there are a number of times when you need some totally arbitrary object whose actual instance is totally it just cannot be the example i gave in a comment to another post is the implementation of or or type of which is commonly done by using a backing and using the keys as the you often cannot use as the so what is commonly done is to use a static instance as the which will be ignored and never some placeholder is common use is with the keyword where is needed to synchronize and you want to ensure that your synchronizing item is totally private to avoid deadlock where different classes are unintentionally synchronizing on the same a very common idiom is to allocate a final to use in a class as the to be as of java 5 and and related this idiom is measurably less it has been quite useful in java to have be you could make a good point that with small changes in design or with small api this would no longer be probably correct in the api could have provided a class that extends without adding anything at to be used as a placeholder for the purposes described but if extending but adding what is the value in the class other than allowing to be perhaps one could find a but what value would it add to do are times in programming where you need an concrete object that is not something that you can compare via but you just need any other feature to this it exists only to serve as a unique identifier and otherwise does absolutely satisfies this role perfectly and very would guess that is part of the reason why was not declared it is directly useful for it not to	
i understand the question you want the data to load after the page is in the if this is the then you can fire an event with javascript when the page loads on the method used is to put a hidden not any button on the page and it with the event of the button click event will need to be wired in the also the button would have to be in an update panel that either contains the grids you want to be bound or has the appropriate triggers to cause them to might look at jquery to get manage when this code gets the your code method will fire after the entire dom is which is faster than waiting on the entire page to load and so

idea of a linear index for arrays in matlab is an important an array in matlab is really just a vector of strung out in matlab allows you to use either a row and column or a single linear for 8 1 3 5 4 9 can see the order the elements are stored in memory by unrolling the array into a you can the 8th element is the number in the function find returns its results as a linear result we can access each element in turn of a general array using a single for if we wanted to square the elements of a i know there are better ways to do one might do i 64 1 9 25 16 81 are many circumstances where the linear index is more conversion between the linear index and two dimensional subscripts is accomplished with the sub2ind and ind2sub linear index applies in general to any array in so you can use it on cell the only problem with the linear index is when they get too matlab uses a 32 bit integer to store these so if your array has more then a total of elements in the linear index will it is really only an issue if you use sparse matrices when occasionally this will cause a i use a 64 bit matlab i believe that problem has been resolved for those lucky individuals who

if a unit is used anywhere in the it matter how many more times it matter how many places you remove a unit from if still used at least once the compiled program will behave the and it will have roughly the same only difference would be in the order of unit initialization and finalization order affects the order those sections are executed although the precise effect has never been documented try not to rely on initialization i still encourage you to clean up your unit for the same reason encouraged to clean up your variable lists and your parameter when you get rid of the stuff you it makes it easier to read the code kept because you can be reasonably confident that what reading gives an accurate picture of what the code if your code mentions a bunch of units but never really makes use of then the next time you or someone else looks at the a good change going to spend some time trying to find where your code uses the facilities of those say to this code includes but i see where it draws better take another because i think this code had any responsibilities like can you take some time out of your day to tell me where this unit draws

implementation is severely you truly implement and you end up relying on the garbage collector to clean up your which is a bad you even clean up those resources properly when the gc does come around does do it but by mistake that it is the responsibility of your class to implement as you are holding onto references which implement in your implementation of if you are not being gced is an explicit call to you are to call on any implementations that you are holding check the connection status of the but not the same as calling on and you leak the resource as a result eventually picks it the guideline on how to properly implement see the section of the msdn documentation titled finalize and dispose to clean up unmanaged located should note that i agree completely with these but they are the most for my see

is a cocoa n00b question been programming gui applications for years in other but now i would like to understand what is for the following trivialized have a simple custom that allows the user to draw simple shapes within its implementation is like draw a white nsrect bounds is a nsmutablearray instance whose elements are each wrapping an for in nsrect in addition to drawing the shapes in the we draw the shape based on the current drag can see how simple this code the array instance variable acts as the model that the method uses to draw the new are added to every time the user performs a which also implemented in this custom my this were a cocoa what would be the idiomatic way for my custom view to update its other how should the custom view notify the controller that another shape needs to be added to the list of right the view tracks shapes in its own which is fine as an implementation but i do not want to expose this array as part of my custom public i would want to put and undo code in a centralized place like the controller rather than have it littered all over my custom in my past experience with other gui programming models are managed by an object in my controller and the view generally update them directly the view communicates when something by dispatching an or by calling a method on a controller it has a reference or using some gut feeling is that idiomatic cocoa code would expose a property on my custom and then wire the controller object another object hanging off of the document to the as its in the xib then the view can call some methods like on the but it seems like there are any number of other ways to do such as having the controller pass a reference to a model object list of directly to the custom view or having the view dispatch a notification that the controller would listen to and then the controller updates the should a custom view update a model

is a pretty standard design and there really a true rule of thumb i typically follow is goes in files go in of the considerations to keep in a file is stored in the how are you going to serve it out via you need to set the content if a file on the the web server takes care of all that stuff for very quickly and efficiently even in kernel no interpreted code are typically big databases are certainly but they are slow and inconvenient to back up why make your database huge when you have like really easy to copy files to multiple say running a you can just periodically rsync the filesystem from your master machine to your slaves and use standard static http obviously databases can be clustered as just not necessarily as the flip side of if already clustering your then having to deal with clustered files in addition is administrative this would be a reason to consider storing files in the data in databases is typically you filter sort by or group by that lessens the value of storing it in the the flip databases understand you can use your standard model of transaction isolation to ensure that two clients try to edit the same file at the same this might be not to say you use but now got two things to understand instead of files in a filesystem can be opened with regular whatever you this can be how are you gonna open that word document out of a blob filesystems have and they can be a pain in the they might be useful to your permissions will really bite you if taking advantage of because almost guaranteed that your web server runs with different permissions than your sarah mei this plays into the http question above on the client side you going to remember to set lifetimes on the server side files on a filesystem are a very and optimized access large blob fields may or may not be optimized well by your and almost guaranteed to have an additional network trip from the database to the web server as people tend to use filesystems for files because they support idioms the no reason you have to do it and filesystems are becoming more and more like databases so it surprise me at all to see a complete convergence

is an easy but great data from msdn introduces a way to get data from a child thread by using callback method which is encapsulated by a delegate passed from main thread to the child thread who has the can see that clearly the last example in the msdn q since we are taking about retrieving data child threads to main the call back method should be executed by the main thread and not by the child changed the code a bit to verify so i attached the name of the thread before each public static void task printed i named the child while the main thread got this independent task printed 1 the correct output should have been task printed 1 is drunk me or retrieving data from	
is an elegant algorithm to mix the elements in two arrays potentially differing so that the items are drawn in an alternating fashion from each with the leftovers added to the 1 2 array would prefer the solution in but i should be able to read and transpose solutions in any language even some form of pseudo worry about null checking or any other edge handle two arrays by alternating elements

is definitely the operating system can fetch from the disk to the cache while your code is processing the data already the disk may well still be the bottleneck but you have but for suppose we have processing which takes half the time of representing time going down the we might have this sort of activity without with this is optimised the total time will be to read whole file time to process last piece of instead of to read whole file time to process whole it is tricky need to have an operating system where you can tweak or turn off the another alternative is to change how opening the file for in if you open the file with the cache is more likely to do the right try with and without that has spoken mostly about prefetching general caching the data even after been delivered to the is a different and obviously acts as a big win if you want to use the same data more than also in where the application has only requested a small amount of but the disk has read a whole block the os actively prefetching blocks which been but can cache the whole block so that if the app then requests more data from the same block it can return that data from the

it is calling the function on a yet not constructed which is undefined you detect it i would argue you also should not try to detect nothing which would happen likely by compared to for example calling a function on an already deleted trying to catch every and all possible mistakes is just about the name declared is visible already in its for other useful consider is a common idiom in c and which still works in i like by herb sutter about null references are likewise the gist try to protect from cases that the language clearly forbids and in particular are in their general case impossible to diagnose you will get a false security over which becomes quite train your understanding of the language and design interfaces in a way raw that reduces the chance of doing and likewise in many cases are not explicitly but rather are left partially because some things are rather difficult to diagnose and partially because undefined behavior lets the implementation design alternative behavior for it instead of completely ignoring it which is used often by existing the above case for any implementation is free to throw an there are other situations that are likewise undefined behavior which are much harder to diagnose efficiently for the having an object in a different translation unit accessed before it was constructed is such an example which is known as the initialization order

knowing your full application it is hard to say what the best way to approach the problem but a common technique is to use a header which starts with a fixed length which denotes the length of the rest of your that your header consist only of a 4 byte integer which denotes the length of the rest of your then simply do the this assumes buffer is at least x bytes and that the socket is unsigned int int bytesread int while result buffer x if 1 throw your bytesread later in the int length buffer we assume that will return 4 new then process the data as makes a few are the same size on the sender and is the same on both the sender and have control of the protocol on both you send a message you can calculate the length up it is common to want to explicitly know the size of the integer you are sending across the network define them in a header file and use them explicitly such these typedefs will vary across different such as but the is that a int8 is always 8 and a uint32 is 32 bits regardless of the platform you are these vary from compiler to so you have to look them up in the compiler char short int int unsigned char unsigned short int unsigned int would change the above length buffer new hope this

lisp implementations have excellent garbage a special problem is that lisp applications often have a high allocation rate of small objects are a few things to conservative not a huge fan of conservative gcs for a problem of conservative gcs is that they find all this can be a problem for long running programs and lead to fragmentation and not reclaimed unused precise gcs are using the tag information of lisp data and can identify every data type of every conservative gcs were invented for programming language implementations that use tagged data compacting to work against memory fragmentation in long running a gc that compacts and localizes objects can be a problem sometimes comes up when hashtables need to be rehashed the location a copying gc may need more memory there is a from and a to space of but when the gc copies the objects from one memory space into it automatically makes it more more advanced gcs on the lisp can also sort objects and allocate objects of the same type near each other assuming that this will speed up accessing this means that there is a first gc stage that exclusively runs in main memory and gets some support from a memory management unit to identify changed memory scanning main memory is fast than scanning virtual memory and scanning only changed memory regions reduces the amount of work when lots of objects are allocated and quickly turning into this gives very short gc usually gcs nowadays are there is more than one generation and objects that survive a few gcs are promoted to an older usually only the first generation is gced very gcs lispworks and allegro cl have a lot of tuning especially for applications it makes sense to read the manual and for example tune the number of their sizes and other gc over virtual memory is usually very avoid that if possible add more ram to the memory for example the web server does some manual memory management using these are pools of objects that can be reinitialized very the lisp machines were using this a typical use of them is in read buffers for instead of creating new strings by every read it is useful to use reusable some common lisp allow stack allocation of some data leaving the block then automatically frees the this assumes then that the memory is no longer referenced on leaving a none of the usual common lisp implementations has a concurrent gc and support for concurrent lisp some implementations have concurrent lisp but the gc will stop them all while it is the if you are not sure where allocation happens and what the gc you need to find that out using profiling your lisp has a precise generational gc which runs in main memory it is hard to get problems with long clozure cl free common lisp for example has a very good gc you want to avoid memory fragmentation and garbage collections in virtual if necessary use a 64bit lisp implementation with more main and configuring the garbage can see from the documentation that lispworks and allegro cl have lots of knobs for tuning lisp has a few functions that deal with the implementation is a function that gives an overview of memory gives more detail 2 generation total size allocated free 725k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion generation total size allocated free 871k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space generation total size allocated free 1585k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion generation total size allocated free 128k segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion segment total size allocated free minimum free space awaiting promotion sweeps before promotion size allocated free

looking at the it looks to me like the page mess takes place entirely within the and is not something that you need to be worrying about from user gotta remember that this article was written for which is nowhere near as advanced as delphi on the memory management the uninitialized pointers issue is a lot less of a mess in delphi than in for two checks for uninitialized variables at compile which whatever a lot of c compilers tend to have trouble initializes all of its dynamic memory to so you have random heap garbage to deal with that might look like a good pointer when really this means that most bad pointers give you access which are easy to instead of silently failing and corrupting

looks like a good article on the the oom gist is that linux when a process asks for more linux will give it that even if it is claimed by another under the assumption that nobody actually uses all of the memory they ask the process will get exclusive use of the memory it has allocated when it actually uses not when it asks for this makes allocation and might allow you to and allocate more memory than you really once processes start using this linux might realize that it has been too generous in allocating memory it and will have to kill off a process to free some the process to be killed is based on a score taking into account runtime processes are memory usage processes are less and a few other including a value you can adjust to make a process less likely to be all described in the article in a lot more and here is that explains pretty well how a process is chosen with some kernel code the great thing about this is that it includes some commentary on the behind the various

make constructors but you can use a generic static method constructor then do whatever you need to after the if another alternative in some cases might be to introduce a interface which the generic interface as per the you want to save the argument into the newly created and you want to do so in a strongly typed then the type must be generic as that point the constructor problem goes but you want to keep a static generic method anyway in a so you can take advantage of type static class public static return new class public x new noinference new withinference

many good interview the question is phrased a little to force the interviewee to ask clarifying questions and state i think a number of the other answers here are as they poke at these assumptions and demonstrate assuming the text is stored but there is a way to iterate over each word in the text without loading the whole text into the code below find the top n only data structure is a mapping of pairs and it only keeps the top n of so the memory use is which is the runtime is which is but acceptable given the problem the gist of the algorithm is for each word in the count how many times it and if in the running then add it to the list and remove the previous minimum that the actual program below loads the entire text into merely for convenience of some boilerplate to grab a big piece of text off the web for httpget let req let resp let stream let reader new let data data text httpget words perhaps actually stored in but so long as we can over all the words in the text n 5 how many words we want to findmin map pair with mininum value in a let k v map k v if v mv then else let mutable freqcounts for word in words let mutable count for x in words if x word count count let findmin if count mincount freqcounts word count if freqcounts n freqcounts minstr freqcounts

might want to be careful of the hippo in the the highest paid opinion is not always a good tended to focus more on providing great tools and support for these done take some of the hassle out of so that it becomes faster and more developers are then more flexible in terms of their and more amenable to testing and deployment are a couple of good ones to start make sure every developer can run up their own software stack in a few seconds and try out ideas developers are then able to make revisions quickly or run down side paths they find and these paths are often the most and by successful i mean measured success based on real metrics gathered right in the system and made readily available to all the owner is then able to set the which they probably care rather than the which they either care about or have no experience in course it depends on the owner and your particular but found that metrics are easier to discuss than and that developers are pretty good at interpreting them a typical problem might be that customers seem to spend a long time filling their shopping carts but go on to a marketing requirement might be to make the checkout button bigger and the requirement might be to take the customer straight to as the ceo only ever buys one item at a time the ui requirement might be to place a second checkout button at the top of the cart as well as the existing one at the the requirement might be some web ajax widget that follows the mouse pointer around the the customer probably saw the ridiculous cost of delivery and ran but redefine the problem as a instead of a and suddenly the developer becomes the developer have to do 10 rounds with the cmo on what shade of red the button should he can play with his web thing all and then rush off the other 3 solutions on monday each one gets deployed live for 48 hours and the gets measured and reported none of it makes any but the developer got to do their job and the business shifts focus onto the crappy products they sell and the price they gauge on so the example is a lot of work in there to make sure that the project is the team is hot deployment is instant rollback is and that on what we wanted to get to is a state where the full potential is not so why involved not just from the but also in the start out with an issue like the number of clicks during registration is too run it through a design and we found that the number of clicks actually went up in the design that was our experience but leave the developer some freedom to just the number of and you might actually end up with a patented as we not that the developer cares about but it had merit and no

my experience with linq to i have concluded for a few reasons that linq is using reflection to set and get field values in entity class i know if i can remember all the but what i can tell i recall linq does not call any property but directly sets and reads all the private field values which can only be done via as far as i names provided by the metadata the attributes on the entity class provide field name information in string form the database column and property name are for you can conclude from this that linq must be using reflection to look up the member to access think it does this to enforce simplicity you can rely on the values in the fields in the entity class directly mirroring the database column and not much overhead in retrieving the object from the database a newly created entity to correspond to values retrieved from the database should not be routed through property one thing i have done to represent enumerated values retrieved from the for is to make some of the properties private and wrap them in a manually coded property in a partial class that reads and writes the linq

myself have used the irepository approach lately that keith you should not be focusing on that pattern there are a few more pieces in the ddd playbook that can be applied for your there is the concept of value objects you can apply in you it would be the the difference between a value object and an entity object is that entities have an vos do the identity really is the sum of not a unique in the book design also a free pdf he explains this very well by stating that an address is really just a point on earth and does not need a separate identity like a that point on earth is the combination of the and it can have latitude and longitude but still those are even vos by definition because a combination of two for combining your entities into a single entity to act do not forget about the services concept in the ddd in your that service would class void do some work for a new is a need for a service when you have two entities that need both need a similar action to coordinate a combination of other in your saving a and creating a blank at the same usualyl require an how would you go about saving the address vo in the you would use an iaddressrepository but since most orms require all objects have an the mark the identity as internal in your so it is not exposed outside of your model this is steven own class make your identity isdbgenerated autosync internal int addressid everything else public string streetnumber public string street public string city

not even just locking that is the you really want thread two to always print then you need a condition reason is that there is a race regardless of whether or not you create thread 1 before thread it is possible that thread code can execute before thread and so the map will not be initialized to ensure that no one reads from the map until it has been initialized you need to use a condition variable that thread 1 also should use a lock with the as others have because you want threads to access the map as though they are the only ones using and the map needs to be in a consistent is a conceptual example to help you think about you have a linked list that 2 threads are in thread you ask to remove the first element from the list the head of the in thread you try to read the second element of the that the delete method is implemented in the following make a temporary ptr to point at the second element in the make the head point at then make the head the temporary if the following sequence of events removes the heads next ptr to the second t2 tries to read the second but there is no second element because the next ptr was completes removing the head and sets the 2nd element as the read by t2 failed because t1 use a lock to make the delete from the linked list is a contrived and necessarily how you would even implement the delete it shows why locking is it is necessary so that operations performed on data are you do not want other threads using something that is in an inconsistent this

of a homework use a relational database but that probably help first thing you need to figure as others have already is how much data an search fast as long a is since a trivial amount of data this a trivial problem it in an and just going to assume the amount of data is your search requirements appear to require the data sorted city unique identifier of actually too hard to is store in some the array index becomes the unique we deleting or if we do delete cities we leave that array spot wasting some adding is we also need to be able to find most fewest may happen adding changing number and borrowing from relational an index using some form of balanced databases use a but different ones may work for check on in each tree just keep a pointer of the city no reason to make another recommend a tree over a hash for one simple you can do a preorder or reverse order traversal to find the top n a hash do if modifications may not just use another array to the once duplicate cities to to do this depends on how you have to query the and what can the most general is that each profile can be multiple cities and each city can be associated with we want to be able to efficiently query from ask both visits and cities does lifting from databases create another a fairly simple one along the lines btree pointers here or use a pointer for both indices to say bob has visited phoenix and to say bob has visited vegas as add another so have two of them for you have a you can store these either in a tree or go with the since that code is but a hash would be instead of for just like we did for the city visit create an index so the lookup can be done from that side now have a way to look up the 5 cities an on the city visit count and find out who visits by search for each city in the index to get grab only unique and you have your and something seems wrong this seems like an awful lot of code for your instructor to want written in several

of these questions are things that you need to try different options to see what works that is the problem with there is no way to do almost you need to find out what works for your specific i will give my advice for your i prefer incremental i think it is important for the network weights to be updated after each this is a tough it really depends on the complexity of your how many input output and training patterns that there for your i might start with 100 and try ranges up and down from 100 to see if there is i usually calculate the total error of the network when applied to the test set the training after each if that error increases for about 5 i will stop training and then use the network that was created before the increase it is important not to use the error of the training set when deciding to stop this is what will cause you could also try a probabilistic neural network if you are representing your output as 26 each representing a letter of the this network architecture is good for classification it may be a good idea just to try a few different architectures to see what works best for your

out this for discussion related to what you are asking when you normally click on a link on the page the browser makes a request to the server to get the next just like there is a lot of pushing towards semantically relevant css it is also important that your page requests are semantically the problem with using links to remove items is that it is making a request to something in the from this comes the problem that some search engines might index your links and accidentally erase there also comes the problem of request which can make an unsuspecting user make a command to a website without being so the proper way to handle this is by following the rule that request that modifies state in the server should be processed via as instead of doing url is better to do url you would like to keep your links while maintaining the have to resort to return but for the your django view would then do something like if remove as scott django has some built in stuff to help you avoid the request forgeries i mentioned since it is still possible to do it even if you are doing a post slightly the way to avoid this is to have some kind of token tied to the form that needs to be validated server side before allowing the action to be check out the class for more details on it will essentially automate some of that work out of it for and the use of http get and safe http rfc of the world wide volume post with a regular request forgeries and

php in the database is a bad design smell in even though in this case you are pretty sure it can never contain unsafe it is always good to minimize the number of assumptions or defenses like that you have to if you store php code in the then an attack in which an attacker gains access to your database quickly becomes a lot more turning into an attack in which an attacker can run arbitrary i know that having your database compromised like this is highly but nonetheless it is good security practice not to let even an unlikely situation compromise your system more than it needs people that should without be avoided in php always an this i think that i would have to say that using would be the best solution for because you are already storing php code in the so using is not going to increase your risk any further than recommend try to validate the code before you by being conservative in what you assume that somehow an attacker got into your database even thought that is at least give some serious thought to rewriting your application so that php code is not stored in a if you are storing complex data think about something like json or even xml safe parsers exist for sorry if this answer seems a bit i just happen to feel this sort of thing is very

reviewing some code and feel suspicious of the technique being a linux there are two processes that attach memory the first process periodically loads a new set files to be and writes the shared memory id location in the shared memory the second reads this location and uses the shmid to other shared a it seems to me it might be implementation to what happens if one process tries to read the memory while written by the but perhaps bus locking bits on the it matter if the reading process got it would only matter if the read was something that was neither the old value nor the new this is an edge only 32 bits are being written and for shmat stuff led me to anything definitive in suspect strongly not safe or and what really is some pointers to articles that describe the problems in articles on shared memory locking

seems to be a reasonable the reason you want to use too many static is that you end up moving away from object oriented programming and more into the realm of structured your case where you are simply transforming a to say all doing is transforming text to go from a static method would make if invoking these static methods on an object frequently and it tends to be unique for many calls the way you use it depends on the or it is part of the inherent behavior of the it would be wise to make it part of the object and maintaining a state of one way to do this would be to implement it as an method return transformed string method return transformed string object implements interface mystring implementations of the interface would yield the necessary and it is reusable across the board since it an interface you can make it specific to the method method one good example of great use of static methods are html helper methods in mvc or they create html elements that tied to the behavior of an and are therefore changed functional programming to structured programming some reason i got props to torsten for pointing that

so many c this is very common as you are trying to disguise that an object is a you are trying to imply that this is the object that all your functions manipulate know it is a pointer underneath but it represents the object you are db if db is not a pointer things could be mydb is probably a pointer at some this is no longer because we can pass things around by reference and the methods are incorporated into the class this time we can call be or let the destructor handle

solve i ended up using the tupletopropertyresulttransformer and providing the list of property there are a few limitations to the main one being that the sql query must return the results in the same order as you provide your properties to the tupletopropertyresulttransformer the property types are inferred so you need to be careful with decimal columns returning only integer values apart from that using the tupletopropertyresulttransformer provided a reasonably easy way to use an sql query to return a collection of objects without explicitly mapping the objects within

specific community extension for joomla is are also extensions problem will be to find a combination which does what you want to an acceptable your customer is not satisfied and has musts which the solution provide you will have to start hacking the extensions or start writing hacking a joomla installation is not really a good idea since upgrading will become hard and a not upgraded joomla installation is a great security the end you might be better of developing your own joomla extension which does what you need it to or refrain from using joomla at more extensions you use at the same the harder maintenance of hacked code will pros and cons in is definitely one of the best cms but it always depends on your what tools you two websites can help with the choice a page where you can over a 100 open source cms and similar basically an extremely large feature comparison matrix of almost 1000 cms and similar software all price own experience was a when typo3 was strong among free cms but that time is the interface is clunky and typo3 has fallen far behind in the then there was a time when mambo became strong and later joomla split from mambo and became even but the code legacy of the joomla series was strongly flawed and a new player quickly took the cleaner clearer node based maybe for some too hard to in the same time when drupal got strong and the joomla series had serious security stories about hacked installations piled up and drupal had the pole position for some joomla is a completely different it has a few fantastic new features and in every upgrade more and more code follows mvc and other nice together with the enormous wealth of extensions design joomla definitely offers more options than any other open source had several extrem cases which i would do custom development where only joomla was able to fullfill all the needs for a there are also a few new names which have a great silverstripe for

standard approach in the webapp world is to split the key and put it in different you might split the key and put part of it in the filesystem of the part of it in the jndi configuration and part of it in the getting any single piece particularly hard if examining backup media or sql but getting all of the pieces will require a lot more can split a key by it with random numbers of the same a cryptographically strong random number you can repeat this process several times if you want to split the key into multiple at the end of the process you three partial keys such that p1 p2 p3 you might need to some of the partial keys so they can be stored in a jndi are more sophisticated ways to split a an algorithm where you require all of the pieces to recreate the but beyond what you need you can require the user to actively enter the there are pbe algorithms that convert a password to a good symmetric you want to find one that requires an external file as again a case the tape backups or the password itself you need you could also use this to split the password into two pieces with jndi you can use a plaintext passphrase in jndi and an initialization file somewhere in the whatever you do be sure you can your application fairly one approach is to use the password obtained above to decrypt another file that contains the actual encryption this makes it easy to change the password if you think been compromised without requiring a massive reencryption of all of the data just reencrypt your actual

style has the highest will if you are providing the same selectors in both stylesheets the latest one will from the article i linked which css rule is applied by the is usually the reason why your apply to some although you think they selector has its place in the specificity two selectors apply to the same the one with higher specificity are four distinct categories which define the specificity level of a given inline and can understand specificity if you love star specificity can understand specificity if you love specificity for poker selectors have an equal specificity the latest rule is the one that selectors have an unequal specificity the more specific rule is the one that with more specific selectors have a greater last rule defined overrides any conflicting embedded style sheet has a greater specificity than other selectors have a higher specificity than attribute should always try to use ids to increase the class selector beats any number of element universal selector and inherited selectors have a specificity of can calculate css specificity with css specificity are the official docs on

submitted the question a couple of days but by continued research and after reading i think i have found an interesting white paper that i found very informative and comparison of the top four roger methodologies have come and gone in the last 20 at this perhaps 90 percent of the field use one of these four zachman framework for enterprise as a is actually more accurately defined as a taxonomy open group architectural framework called a is actually more accurately defined as a process federal enterprise be viewed as either an implemented enterprise architecture or a proscriptive methodology for creating an enterprise architecture gartner be best described as an enterprise architectural practice white paper discusses these four approaches to enterprise it does so within the context of a fictional company that is facing some very nonfictional operations these problems systems that have become unmanageably complex and increasingly costly to systems that are hindering the ability to respond to and market conditions in a timely and information that is consistently just plain culture of distrust between the business and technology sides of the white paper helped me in several gave me a good introduction and history of architecture architecture introduced me to what the author suggest is the 4 leading enterprise architectures then continues to compare them in a logical and simple manner with good examples that i could relate cannot say that all my questions have been answered and i am now ready to die but much has become clearer and thus i thought that someone else out there may also find this would still value any additional suggestions and questions you may have on this

suggested in you should really provide a test case to reason reasons behind performance differences will change depending on the test being suggest that the static vs dynamic nature may well have a lot to do with for the is extremely cheap as it can be determined accurately at even virtual calls just involve a single level of when binding becomes a wider range of things to know enough details about python to claim to understand its exact runtime which i suspect may vary with version and implementation there is such a thing as byte which is then executed by a virtual machine whether this virtual machine actually performs or not is another	
suggestion works beautifully with one caveat the dynamic elements created with script will not be rendered if the user returns to the formset using the an issue that may be a deal breaker for user adds two new forms to the formset using the user populates the forms and submits the user clicks the back button in the formset is now reduced to the original all dynamically added forms are not is not a defect with script at but a fact of life with dom manipulation and suppose one could store the values of the form in the session and have some ajax magic when the formset loads to create the elements again and reload the values from the but depending on how anal you want to be about the same user and multiple instances of the form this may become very has a good suggestion for dealing with

suppose i could define every service operation into a single service but there could be quite a few operations and rather divide them into several cohesive service makes sense to group operations into cohesive service the granularity number of operations per service will depend on your but one service contract per operation seems splitting my operations into a set of service contracts mean that i would have to host each service on a separate at you can have several service contracts on the same could have a concrete class that implements several service contracts suggested by koistya navin is an internal implementation would only consider doing this if the operation contract implementations were so closely related that it makes sense to implement them in a single which case it may make sense to make them part of the same service

that has helped me in the along with creation on demand as mghie was to use the call lockwindowupdate around the frame this call is global in nature but will reduce the initial flicker as the paint operations will not get invoked until after you relase the lock on the parent the general code template would look something like the your frame code goes running with the window it will not respond to paint also the function is so anything else that calls will break your when the lock is then the window is immediately which saves you from performing that call in as pointed out in the comments care should be taken when using the lockwindowupdate however i have used this method with great success in the past and still recommend if used what you want to do with this method is to call inside this or pop up a modal dialog or a showmessage call even populate from a just restrict the portion within the lock to what your if you play your users notice anything also used as a but in reality i generally only lock handle of the container that the frame is being placed could try the method mentioned in the article in the but this requires that the message loop is also processed and generally my calls to lockwindowupdate are extremely

that were added to a branch and then changed on the branch get added when doing a merge across a number of revisions because subversion is trying to apply a context diff to a file that exist in the working directory new you will see a warning from svn stating something like missing file are two basic ways to deal with commit your branch is always a good idea since merging can mess things up sometimes and much nicer to simply be able to then merge each specific revision that adds files at a in order to ensure that the files actually get added to your working other option you have is to create empty files using the unix touch for all the files that were added across the revisions can get a list of these files by simply doing the merge with the specifier and taking note of all the missing then run the merge with your entire revision list that will merge the changes into the new empty files and everything should be peachy

the following result1 result2 should always equal result2 the thing it result1 is and result2 is the only difference is the order of the know that doubles are implemented in such a way that rounding issues can aware that i can use decimals instead if i need absolute or that i can use in my if just a nerd who wants to understand what the compiler is can anyone tell to everyone so far suggested reading up on floating point arithmetic talked about the inherent inaccuracy of how the cpu handles but i feel the main thrust of my question is still which is my fault for not phrasing it let me put it like down the above i would expect the following operations to be r1 r2 r3 r4 assume that each of the above additions had a rounding error so r1 contains rounding error r2 includes rounding errors e1 r3 contains e3 and r4 contains e3 i know how exactly how the rounding errors happen but i would have expected to equal clearly it but that seems somehow wrong to another thing is that when i run the above i get any rounding what makes me think the compiler doing something weird rather than the know asking a lot and maybe the best answer anyone can give is to go and do a phd in cpu but i just thought at the il from my original code clear that the compiler not the cpu doing private hidebysig static void cil init float64 float64 nop ret compiler is adding up the numbers for does the order affect the rounding when adding multiple doubles in

the intel software developers manual it says that interrupt vectors are usually user defined for external io in my systems programming class i must develop a simple device my question is how can i define a specific interrupt vector to be used for a specific is this done with the we are developing a simple operating system so my situation is quite in the end i need to understand how this all happens on an x86 currently our system is set up so that a few interrupt vectors above 32 are assigned to devices like a serial port and in reading the datasheet for the intel 82801eb ich5 io specifically the section concerning the 8259 it says that irq15 is the secondary ide how would that eventually be put on the stack as a interrupt may just be so confused that this question make so i apologize in so our systems programming class has a very simple which has kernel routines for installing isrs to handle specific interrupts given the vector in our class last quarter the professor gave us a header file that defined the keyboard as vector number 0x2c or something i am trying to find out how to map the primary secondary ide channel interrupts to various isrs using our kernel for all of the unused interrupt vectors have a default handler that would print messages if an interrupt so ide interrupts even on at the however that is another do i identify device specific interrupts on

the reasons string are immutable in java have much to do with the two main reasons are the are extremely widely used type of it is therefore more or less guaranteed to be used in a strings are immutable to make sure that it is safe to share strings among having an immutable strings ensures that when passing strings from thread a to another thread thread b cannot unexpectedly modify thread only does this help simplify the already pretty complicated task of but it also helps with performance of access to mutable objects must somehow be synchronized when they can be accessed from multiple to make sure that one thread attempt to read the value of your object while it is being modified by another proper synchronization is both hard to do correctly for the and expensive at immutable objects cannot be modified and therefore do not need string interning has been it only represents a small gain in memory efficiency for java only string literals are this means that only the strings which are the same in your will share the same string if your program dynamically creates string that are the they will be represented in different immutable strings allow them to share their internal for many string this means that the underlying array of characters does not need to be for say you want to take the five first characters of in you would calls in this what the method does is simply to create a new string object that shares underlying but who knows that it starts at index 0 and ends at index 5 of that to put this in graphical you would end up with the mystring v quick brown fox jumps over the lazy shared makes this kind of operations extremely and since the operation neither depends on the length of the original nor on the length of the substring we need to this behavior also has some memory since many strings can share their underlying

the risk of being back an opposing point of view i first encountered while reading on it was a point of view that was very but made sense to me upon and setters are of getters and setters is in opposition to the fundamentals of object oriented data abstraction and overuse of getters and setters will make your code less agile and maintainable in the long they ultimately expose the underlying implementation of your locking implementation details into the interface of the your field needs to change from a to another string is better optimized or supports a different need to change the private data the the and all the client code of this class that calls these getters and than design your classes to and design them to or ask yourself why writing a what are you doing with that perhaps displaying that data on or doing some processing on is this process better exposed as a method of not to say that getters and setters have their in i believe the fundamental reason for their use is to interface with the visual studio but if you find yourself writing them in probably best to take a step look at your and see if something is try to an example to a class that represents a bank account int in lets say const return void deposit int const return void dostuffwithaccount account print account int balance deposit some money into deposit take very long to see that this is very poorly are an awful currency deposit should be a function of the getters and setters make it more difficult to fix the since the client code dostuffwithaccount is now bound to the we used to implement the account lets make a pass on this code and see what we can a class that represents a bank account float void void void o dostuffwithaccount account print account deposit some money into float depositamt is a step in the right you could have changed the internal type to and still supported the account int old float support the old const return void provide a new interface for the float const return not how to expose getter for float as well as void it take long to realize that the arrangement is doubling your workload and complicating matters as you need to support both the code that used ints and the new code that will use the deposit function makes it a bit easier to expand the range of types for class is probably not the best since the account balance is a natural operation for an the overall is that you must be careful with getters and do not get into the habit of writing getters and setters for every it is quite easy to expose and lock yourself into an implementation if you are not

the worry about bits on the wire but the overhead of reading and the tend to favor short names inside function and make function names as long as but as short as possible without loosing useful doubt it is a it depends on whether you want your code to resemble natural language or be more implicit and prefix variable names to inject context information into i if that is the ide should provide such injection capabilities as a visual overlay on the code via context next version of visual studio will make such annotation gymnastics much easier via a extensibility mechanism extended deep into the editor i have not used visual studio for editing javascript see now that your concern is indeed the space this should ever be an always always always favor readability over bits on the since compression as noted by the other only thing i would add is the which is that sometimes comprehension is made easier with compact names over excessively long but it is harder to get short names long names are much easier and faster to make right in my reason for short names should never be data compression only cognitive what works is	
the wpf grid control is easy when your child elements are always contained within a single grid cell there is no a fixed width column stays the requested fixed an auto column will indeed size itself to be as wide as the widest cell in the star columns share any remainder space according to their relative star all is simple in the once you have a cell that spans two or more columns the width of the columns becomes more complicated to calculate and indeed seems here is a trivial example of what i we can define two columns with the first as auto and the second as fixed at 30 we define a button that spans both of the columns and happens to measure at 80 pixels my machine with my font and theme settings need to allocate the 80 pixels width of the button across the two spanning given the second column is fixed at 30 i would expect 30 to be allocated against that column and the remaining 50 go to the first because the first column is auto it seems the obvious thing to if you try this in practice you will find that the first column is 0 pixels and the second column has become the full even though that second column is defined as fixed and so should not be growing it as stretched to the full width of the maybe i am missing something here but that does not seem very logical to to my actual is there a full description of the logic used by the grid control for doing this calculations so that i can fully understand how it i have searched msdn and google and find nothing that describes how spanning elements affect the column know the algorithm used to size grid columns with spanning

there are two reasons to instantiate a new object it and it from the first case is handled by the you can provide several methods to create an object on the methods should return valid so you can pass parameters to these methods to provides required factory method can also chose the actual type to instantiate based on should not mix this with rehydrating from the this kind of instantiation should take values from the datarow and instantiate the object with i usualy call this a instead of a main difference is that the factory will instantiate an object with a new identity while the databuilder will instantiate an object with an already existing

think a controller should be dealing with model tend to think that controller is really part of the ui i prefer to inject a service layer the controller and the rest of the the web tier accepts http unmarshals parameters from request objects into objects that the service interface can deal and marshals the response to send all the work with units of and dealing with model and persistence objects is done by the approach is more service it separates the service from the user leaving open the possibility that several clients can reuse the same it makes the layer that marshals requests to the service so easy to switch out soap services for rest or ejb or corba or whatever the next new thing will

think by the most fun and exciting platform to develop even though i am not a huge fan of its api is full featured and quite easy to appstore behind makes it the most compelling platform to work despite all the bad rep apple has for its unclear approvement documentation is very too old and almost unsupported by complete lack of good development documentation is very i like windows in my visual studio is the best ide you can use to and what you use when you develop for windows having said windows mobile really rocks for formbased but for general purpose is still behind documentation is very i like very but even though i like eclipse for java not that great for mobile its simulator is too i used it that much documentation is quite having behind is the most difficult but it has the biggest installed base so it be ignored by any tools that great and neither is java easy to use as long as you mess with protected api app will need special approvement from rim to use if you take into consideration java based i like android but installed based makes it difficult to ignore this only for low end

think going to be able to do better than using a i may be used before for the same and they usually like using an of when the button goes the mouse is also at this effects a first also changes the interval to the mouse comes the changing of the from to means that they have to hold the mouse down for a but once they the scrolling action happens more button being really an more of a state it occur at a specific point in	
think i found a solution that feel free to chime in if any of you have a better my button i placed the following onclientclick event calls my fadeout method below which returns false if the current content is faded in and returning false cancels altogether the asynchronous postback that the updatepanel would have the animation is done i set the isfadedin variable to false and click the button again know that the code to click the button is not cross browser compatible right this is just a proof of concept so that piece of it will need to be since isfadedin is set to this time the fadeout method does not return a false and so the updatepanel performs the got an event handler attached to the pageloaded event so that i can fade the new content in once it is done i can now finish my animations before loading the new i have to wait for the animation to finish before starting the postback so users actually have to wait a little opacity isfadedin if if opacity opacity else isfadedin if if opacity opacity else isfadedin return

think that makes a lot of it the policy itself that you depend rather than just the of you going to want to ask the policy questions whether or not an action is that means need an instance of the policy which means it makes sense for it to be passed into the are suitable when you want a strongly typed api where part of the api depends on another but the implementation itself care what the type is with some the collections api is probably the canonical example a care what but wants to expose a api terms of i see that fitting in with your policy	
think that option is built into but with you could just use a simple help make this more declare the regex once perhaps at class level or make it static rather than recreating it all the odds are only using the returned array to iterate over the you can make this faster by skipping the call on the end and just keeping the ienumerable for your keysplitter new regex test key in of the nice things about how works is that this will still only iterate over your results because the method in the function will do lazy depending on what you need to do inside the for loop you might be able to gain a similar efficiency by adding a	
think that the separation of view from business is a velocity feature that is not present in you can do business logic in jsp or but not recommended at but i agree in your point regarding the is compiled to so i think that velocity is not done benchmarks of because closer to of creating reusable has lots of has no components itself component of open source 3rd have seen far more projects using jsp or jsp related technologies than maybe because velocity is really low are plenty of tools for especially the eclipse jboss suite has a good jsp for velocity are mostly not functional or pretty basic get lucky if you have syntax

think the most important thing with your backing beans is to seperate their if you have a front page for a cms system i would see it as bad practice to put every piece of code into one bean bean would turn very large easier for other people to find what their looking for if they are troubleshooting the login if they then can easily just look up the you have small pieces of functionality that is clearly distinct from the rest of your by separating this i would imagine you would make it easier on yourself to this code into something when you already have a nice bean with good 1 big to do it will make it more memory dependant you have to do declarations like this mybigbean bigbean new instead of using the funksjonality you actually needed by doing loginbean loginbean new me if im wrong my separating your beans is like separating your you dont want 1 big method which runs over of but rather split it up with new methods that handles their specific most likely someone other than you will have to work on your jsf projects for the i dont see it as a troublesome issue to allow your jsf pages access too the properties in objects in your this is support which is built into and really just makes it easier to read and build your allready separating the mvc logic by doing this your saving yourself tons of lines with getters and setters in your for example i have a really huge object given to me by the web where i need to use some properties in my if i were to make a for each property my bean would expand with atleast 100 more lines of variables and methods for getting the by using the built in jsf functionality my time and precious code lines are my 2 cents regarding this even with the question already marked as

think the question has more to do with the concepts involved than the answers to the and internalize keeping unrelated pieces separate its important to get real reuse on different related technologies help you on its you that separate the app in appropriate which you can appropriately reuse for different endpoint for communication based on known protocols allows implementing different pieces with different the operations flow like independent actions based on different gives you a lot of places where you can add is a particular of the overall process using lots of resources and the server take it just move to a separate load kept and that server taking it add an additional server and load you also have more opportunity to use caching and connection a critical that needs to be available all the add a server so you can have a fail have an overall process that needs to be all the use queues for pieces that can be processed you really need to support that type of set appropriate targets that relate to the specific if you really need to support that type of i recommend you get someone on board who has dealt with it is something for a load that might eventually identify the bounded contexts and design the interaction between those with a soa keeping the code clean is all you have to do for the use loose focused integration etc in your code with good if you later need to separate pieces of the it will be a lot

think your focus should be on the object and not on the event for example you have the object eventargs e performactions did something to the effect as as inside the person you would expect to see something to the effect inationality get return set if point here is that you let the object keep track of what is happening to not the this also lets you keep track of dirty flag tracking on your which could be useful for persistence later also keeps your ui clean and keeps it from getting odd event registration code that will most likely be error

this question is a dupe say because this specific question was not asked there a way to a to a csv prior to excel that allows excel to understand the correct formatting of the csv file requiring of the csv file and without requiring intervention in order to correctly format the fields by i mean any method whatsoever of generating a definition that can be saved somewhere on customer machine and then referenced whenever the usual csv import has to take including but not limited to or whatever conventions excel has for this kind of operation has a habit of being by modifying input data when opened from such as a csv an example of what is meant by see any of the various following regularly have to send csv files to customer x and we do not have the luxury of modifying the csv files directly in order to them into a format that excel will render exactly as customer x does not always have the personnel who are trained with excel in order to do the import excel to stop applying to csv import

to extend this a remember that arrays are c so all you have is the address of a piece of memory that purports no to be an array of expand a little therefore really have as all it has are so when you make something an what really happens is you tell the compiler that some variable represents an useful to make a distinction in c between a and a in a simply giving something a name and a in a you actually allocate if we start off by definiing an array means telling the compiler we want space for 100 we want it to all be allocated in one and going to use the name for the operator gives the number of bytes used by a type or an so our array will take up on most that will be 400 but it varies from machine to we define a using as a reminder this is a defining space for a variable that will contain an its size will be which will usually be either 4 or but on some machines could be anything from 2 to 16 on some machines unlikely to run into of the array is the compiler converts that name into an so we can save that address ar this say for convenience that our array happened to be starting at location 1000 in name does have any space allocated to like a a you reverse that this the same reason you this work you change the value of in early versions of this trick would for complicated it was a never lived until tried to debug a program in which the value of is in c are always that the first index is always any other indices are just addresses computed using the is just the address 1000 plus 0 bytes of or is 1000 plus 1 times the size of an so the int and in this is always true in is called an we use the syntax telling the compiler to get the thing at the address contained in is called a we and refer to the same we say telling the compiler we want the thing at the address 0 bytes from is the address one or 4 from refers to the same thing as need the parentheses because we want to add 3 to the address first and then look at the would get the contents pointed to by and then add 3 to thing c or much how big the array really if i come along and do the compiler will happily generate code to look in the cell if in your but if just random fine c c comes from the phone we have the phone we know some which moved down read as equivalent or the same you can depend c know a difference between pointers and you can declare either when you define a you can get exactly the same was anywhere you might write you can replace it with actually a weird side case that breaks but you run into it as a will equal the address at plus this above as when you index into an like it means you want the 42nd whatever over from the start if using then you need to move over 42 times however wide an which is to say all and since is defined as a it all holds for as is a user defined type that overloads and you can decide you want to define a new type that acts just like any other but you can change the way the language does specific a programmer decide to replace the default behavior of the array reference and pointer dereference operators with something of their own as a you be confronted with that but you should be aware of

trying to track down possible causes of my app not being able to connect to a db have a windows service that connects to the database when it the service runs on machines with a reliable wired network installed with startup automatic so normally it starts when windows and in almost all cases this works with one set of xp machines i have control the database connection fails when the service starts up with windows the standard exception is error has occurred while a connection to the connecting to sql server failure may be caused by the fact under the default settings sql does not allow remote sql network 26 error these machines if a user is logged in and starts the service manually it connects to the database which is pretty so i guess the problem at windows startup is service starts before the network is service starts before the machine can connect to dns to resolve the server name how db server names are is a on the machine that initially prevents outgoing problem occur when a user manually starts the so something must have happened to resolve the i guess this is either a process that runs at startup but finished when my service or the fact that a user has logged in possibly something in their logon have direct access to the so need to come up with a good idea of what the problem could be and a way to identify if i repeatedly deploy diagnostic programs so need to be thorough the first first question does anyone know of desktop network policies or software that could cause this second what can i do to diagnose exactly what is thinking of creating a new diagnostic service which will also be installed to start automatically and will perform various actions to see what is going and log this see if there is a network the database server by ip address see if it can find the the database server by the hklm registry key that contains the server name case the hklm registry is later sql connection to the database find out when this starts these steps every few have this service restart the then after a period have a user log the diagnostics should show some useful but anyone have a better idea or additional have also tried changing the service to run as a user account with suitable but that resolve the note that the local system account does have sufficient priveleges to connect to the db since the service works fine when manually so not the same as troublesome machines are running win gives a good discussion of error code connection work when service starts at boot but works when manually

unit has two distinct the interface and the interface section contains all public definitions procedure the implementation section contains all implementation you use a the uses you get access to the public definitions of that this access is not so if unit a interface uses unit and unit c uses unit you do not get access to unit b unless you use it implementation section has access to the to the unit used in both uses clauses and interfaces of used units are compiled first before it continues compiling the this has the advantage that you can have circular dependencies from within the interface fail need interface interface implementation implementation unit also has an initialization section if it has an initialization it could also have a finalization the initialization section is used to initialize the variables of the the finalization sections are used to you use its wise not to count on initializations of other just keep them simple and also are the foo foo f1 f2 f3 an identifier is defined in multiple used the last unit possible in the uses list is so f1 but you can prefix it with the unit name to solve this the introduction of multi part namespaces are allowed which introduces other nice rec1 baz bar baz which these lines gives an error and does the result change if you write uses this case you have a but that is resolved by giving namespace names higher so the first line

updated following update of the question see still think right to be using the factory and correct in overloading the createlabel but i think in passing the labeltype to the createlabel missing the point of using the factory the entire purpose of the factory pattern is to encapsulate the logic which chooses which concrete subclass to instantiate and the calling code should not be telling the factory which type to the benefit is that the code which calls the factory is therefore shielded from changes to that logic in the and also from the addition of new concrete subclasses to the all your calling code need depend on is the and the interface type returned from logic in your code at the point where you call the factory must currently look something like this need to create a label need to create a small label need to create a large label need to create a custom label explicitly telling the factory what to this is because every time a new label type is added to the need the factory code to deal with the new labeltype and add a new to everywhere that the if you move the logic that chooses the labeltype value into your you avoid the logic is encapsulated in the factory along with everything if a new type of label is added to your you only need to change the all existing code calling the factory remains the no breaking is the piece of data that your current calling code uses to decide whether a big label or small label is that piece of data should be passed to the factory and label classes could look like class public labelsize size private public string trackingreference private public string size trackingreference added the null or empty class customlabel public string trackingreference private public string customtext private public string trackingreference throw new customtext class public ilabel labelsize return new public ilabel string return new hope this is

way i can think of is to loop through table one and search for similar rows in table this is how you can do through the table to find if there are rows with same payid and empid in table the method returns more than 0 then disable the from you can also think about a method which can give you intersection of two if these two columns are priamry then this will if then you will need to tweak the code as per your	
way i solved this problem was to place the image within a border with cliptobounds property set to the rendertransformorigin on the image is then set to so the image will start zooming on the center of the the rendertransform is also set to a transformgroup containing a scaletransform and a then handled the mousewheel event on the image to implement void mousewheeleventargs var st double zoom 0 handle the panning the first thing i did was to handle the mouseleftbuttondown event on the to capture the mouse and to record i also store the current value of the this what is updated to implement void mousebuttoneventargs var tt tr is start origin new i handled the mousemove event to update the void mouseeventargs if var tt tr is vector v start forget to release the mouse void mousebuttoneventargs for the selection handles for resizing this can be accomplished using an check out for more	
way that you can avoid this problem is for any project except for a which has no project of doing a from your source control always do an from source inside of visual and do a get latest from solution vs will only pull files that belong to the not a perfect answer when you perform you will likely end up pulling down every file in your but it has worked very well for this requires that you are using a source control tool that offers vs integration it also requires that you add any but required files to your or they will not be pulled down by

work in recently ran a software development procurement process and selected three vendors to work on an agile some were already sure we wanted to run an agile project because we knew our requirements were ambiguous and because it was a web project with a significant design so say that it helps a lot if your client knows about agile and buys in from the even if they actually practice it note that acceptance of agile is growing in government so this may get safeguard we used was to contract a very experienced scrum master to work for us and handle the software project management duties on behalf of our team lead architect usability we spent a lot of time finding this and selected them from three great this was costly but worth we had selected our vendors and broadly agreed their roles we put together a quick mou outlining our intention to the likely budget of the the likely size of the team from each a commitment to have a full contract signed by the end of the and a time materials agreement in the we jumped in with a technical planning sizing session and got that side of things no dev work or design was done in this but we did a lot of sizing and the end of the month we put together contracts for each vendor was but that was one vendor put forward sample contracts that we might one based on payment by thirds of the the other on completion of i think in the end we did completion of sprints using some of the language in the payments section of our standard contract we were okay with this approach acknowledging some because we think there was a huge amount of actual technical risk in the project and because we had a lot of confidence in the procurement process and in the vendors we had the end this was a very successful and we have since started using scrum for other i think having a great team was we were confident in the vendors not only that they could do the but that they were a good fit in terms of their attitude to working as one and in terms of there being roles for each they would not be competing for the same our vendors had not been so we would have had a few more reservations about entering into a contract like but running procurement is almost as much an art as a and we knew we had chosen the team with the best fit an attitude from a pool of other have since rolled over all three contracts for a second year of though say it s not going quite as smoothly this time scrum different team it is still a great project to be involved may also find this

working on an installer project that consists of an msi file and a bootstrap application that manages the and since the need for some of the prerequisites depends on what features the user chooses to the bootstrap app also provides the i want to be able to force the programs programs and control panel to run the bootstrap application instead of the msi when the user wants to run a modify tried changing the modifypath value under the uninstall registry key to the path of the bootstrap but to no clicking the change button in the arp still gets me the there an easy way to do what i failing is there a way for the msi to detect that it was run from the arp using the change button so that i could get it to show an error message that tells the user to run the bootstrap app does the arp use the same command line arguments that a user would use to run the msi and specify a modify install without having to see the maintenance page of the if what should i look my installer is installing not just one but a suite of each of which the user is allowed to choose not to installing these applications as a because most of them depend on one of them in particular being be easier on the user to have just one installer handle them rather than the separate installers that this new installer is going to applications in the suite all require the same set of it is not easy for the msi to check for the prerequisites until it knows which applications in the suite the user wants to we want to make it easy for the user by having the installers for all of the prerequisites for the applications that the user does want installed launched is the main reason why the ui was implemented in the bootstrap it possible for the msi to launch the bootstrap app and then silently exit immediately while the bootstrap app carries eventually relaunching the the bootstrap app launches the one of the command line args it passes into the msi is a property that tells it that the bootstrap app launched this is currently among other to allow the msi to show an error message telling the user to run the bootstrap app unless an uninstall or repair install was specified on the command do i get the arp to run my bootstrap app for a modify	
worry about users doing just to break your if they really want to break your code they can without you providing accessors to your internal by returning a constant the common user will not mistakenly modify your prevents not a malicious coder can break it anyway if they really care and know the environment is lost in the compilation process all compilers i know once the compilation unit is converted into binary those objects do not know about and that can be exploited to take int a a a const return int int does not include but redefines an almost exact copy of a int a a int const return int private int a 10 the code above is incorrect definition rule is there are two definitions for class the fact is that with most compilers the definition of a and malitious a are binary the code will compile and and the result is that external code has access to your private that you know of do it will later be a maintenance pain in the that has cost microsoft quite a bit of money in providing backwards compatibility to software that used private parts of the api returned objects versions of the api that shared the same public interface but changed the internals would break some third party application with some broadly available software the provider in this will go through the pain of providing backwards but with lesser known applications they and suddenly your previously running application will fail in all sort of	
would argue that oop suits those who think in where an object consists of data as well as the functions that operate on that you tend to think of functions and the data they operate on as separate then you are a procedural you tend to think of functions and the data they operate on as being then you are an caution against going out and learning about in order to do programming you need to teach yourself to like an need to get to the point where you understand and can name the benefits vs and will help you to be a better programmer only in the sense that the more styles of programming a programmer the more range in his repertoire for solving problems and writing elegant you cannot go off and write all your code and automatically have good but if you really understand how oop and not just some popular design patterns of the then you can write some pretty good especially when writing a large

would venture to say that there are many shades of gray between having an domain and cramming all of your services into your domain and quite at least in business domains and in my an object might actually be nothing more than just the for whenever the operations that can be performed on that particular object depend on multitude of other objects and some localized say an address for my review of the literature on the i have found a lot of vague ideas and but i was not unable to find a example of where the boundaries between methods and operations should how to implement that with current technology so for the purpose of this i will make up a small example to illustrate my the example of orders and an domain model would look something order long date long user which received the class orderitem long order to which this item long product bigdecimal bigdecimal my the point of the design is to use classes to better model the relationships between an model would look something order long date user orderitem order product bigdecimal bigdecimal you would be using an orm solution to do the mapping in this you would be able to write a method such as that would sum up all the for each order the model would be in a sense that operations that make sense from a business like would be placed in an domain at least in my design does not mean that the should know about your persistence that should be done in a separate and independent persistence operations are not part of the business they are the part of the even in this simple there are many pitfalls to should the entire be loaded with each if there is a huge number of order and you need a summary report for a huge number of would you be using loading objects in memory and invoking on each or is an sql query a much better from every that is why a decent orm solution like offers mechanisms for solving precisely these kind of practical with proxies for the former and hql for the what good would be a theoretically sound model if report generation takes the entire issue is quite much more that able to write or consider in one and not speaking from a position of but everyday practice in deploying business get something out of this feel free to provide some additional details and examples of what dealing regarding the and the example of sending an email after the total has been i would make a distinction fact that an email should be sent after price part of an order should be could also email actual method of sending an one has to is sending of an email an inherent ability of an or yet another thing that can be done with like persisting serialization to different formats i would and what i consider a good oop approach is the define an interface encapsulating operations of preparing and sending an interface emailsender public void public void recipienttype public void public void inside define an operation by which an order how to send itself as an using an email order public void total you should have a facade towards your application a point where the actual response to user action in my this is where you should obtain spring the actual implementations of this for be the spring mvc class orderemailcontroller extends baseformcontroller injected by private ordermanager private emailsender actual sending of modelandview httpservletresponse string id order order return new what you get with this objects contain they objects are decoupled from actual service implementation sending in separate thread by the nature of the interface interfaces are but know about any actual domain for if order gets an extra you need change only the can mock services and test domain objects can test actual services implementations know if this is by standards of certain but it a approach that works reasonably well in

you delete a you have to do something about its there are no children no you just remove the there a left also no you remove the node and move its left child into its for the right just move the child into the place of the deleted problem comes when you want to delete a node which has both left and right you could move the left or the right child into the place of the deleted but what do you then do about the other child and its is you locate the logical successor to the node being by logical i mean say you have a tree made of integers and you delete node with value the logical successor the next largest if you were doing an it would be the element you come to after the element a simple rule to find the logical you go right one always have a because this is the case where you have two and then you go as far left as you element you end up at is the logical larger than the deleted element went right at the but the next largest that element always has only one or no children because you went left as far as you so you go left any more because there is no left so that element has no children or just a right child and that means it falls into one of the catagories children or just one so unlinking element is comes the cool bit consider if that next largest element were in the same place in the tree as the element you want to tree would still be valid and because everything to the left of each element is everything to the right is what you do is you copy the user data in the next largest node into the node being deleted and you delete next largest has no children or just a right so easy to unlink and basically find your logical unlink him from the tree and put his user data into the element actually originally deleting you then of because still physically part of the

you have binary data like buffer want to initialize it like this out a that handles this populatebitset bitmap you want the raw use the populatebitset bitmap do end up allocating the needed memory so you might be better off with a stack allocation and a or you just can wait until and let the move semantics do their unecessary in populatebitset clarify why the first versions allocate twice as much a look at another way to write the first just to shorten the populatebitset bits const bits initialize bitmap copy over data from temp to you put these two lines as in the first you still get a temporary constructed on the followed by an in boost needs to allocate enough memory for the entire set of in boost needs to allocate again enough memory to hold that same set of bit and then copy the values possible that bitmap already has enough so it may not always need to but also possible that it will free its backing memory and reallocate from scratch containers that fit the stl mold also have a swap function that you can use in place of assignment when you intend to throw away one side of the these are usually and as they often just involve swapping some see this for another reason why these are be able to use and still get the advantages of since you can overload on the the container know that when you assign a it knows that it can cannibalize the temp and basically do a the visual studio team blog has covered rvalues and move semantics well

you sure you want to use that will be a which will be if already decided on a 9x9 convolution you need any the cheapest way to do convolution in c is to set up a loop that moves a pointer over the summing the convolved values at each point and writing the data to a new this loop can then be parallelised using your favourite method mpi the you assume the values to be 0 outside the then add a 4 element border of 0 to your 2d array of this will avoid the need for statements to handle the which are your data wraps at the boundaries it is then use a modulo or add a 4 element border which copies the opposite side of the grid fgabcdefgab for 2 this is what you are implicitly assuming with any kind of fourier including if that is not the you would need to account for it before any fft is 4 points are because the maximum boundary overlap of a 9x9 kernel is 4 points outside the main n points of border needed for a x you need this convolution to be really your grid is consider partitioning it into smaller pieces that can be held in the and thus calculated far more this also goes for any you might want to do are ideal for this type of

you want the user to change the virtual directory you can simply remove the dialog from the user click installer project the click on you want different parameters for the web virtual application pool that is normally selected by the installation address dialog you can override with a custom action as others have in my experience custom actions do not help with setting defaults that the user can change because they execute the dialogs that ask for user easiest way to set some defaults that the user can override if necessary in a dialog is to do the the welcome a textboxes dialog example visible properties for all the textboxes to false so no textboxes are the bannerbitmap and bodytext property so it looks somewhat like a the necessary properties you want to override in the set the default value in the most useful properties where the files are to be the virtual directory to be created in the specified the application pool to use this must it be the website where the virtual directory is to be created this is the for the web for also note that the site must is a full list of properties for the installer can be found you really want better control over the iis setup i would suggest changing your project to a standard windows installer project and creating custom install actions so that you can programatically create a good place to start to understand programmaticly creating these things is biggest reason for doing it this way is that custom actions run prompting but the app pool and web sites must be created the installer can

your first question about generically retrieving a search ldap directory server to the ldap protocol i exposes some operational thingies under a node called one of the things you can retrieve through are the which essentially can tell you what the different trees are hosted on this you can retrieve a search base for your be some ldap for servers can host multiple trees so you have to come up with a solution when multiple naming contexts are can be retrieved by querying the server for the dn and specifiyng that you want to get all the operational attributes as just some example for an openldap base note the returns operational should return something similar to that shown below openldap the values in parentheses are added explanations and are not returned by the rfc your second question about the availability of the think that you should rely on this one as it strongly depends on the schema used for storing user data most will have a attribute i but that depends on the flexibility you want to put into your perhaps the best way would be to make the configurable by the could even do this with the search base which would have some performance advantages need to search the whole tree when users are only located in a small subtree and no need to query the
