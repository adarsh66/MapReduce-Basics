a certain page of our jsf the user sees a table listing many which we will call say each job has a which is nothing but a and in this screen the user is able to edit the priorities of the two jobs have the same priority for this finding it hard to build an appropriate ui to deal with setting the tried a simple editbox in the but it soon became clear that it if the user wanted to lower the priority of a job from 100 to he would have to manually room for that by adding 1 to jobs 50 to thinking about a table in which the user could drag drop the rows to visually adjust without ever having to fiddle with priority numbers fact never seeing but i find such does anybody know of such component or have any better ui for in

a current java project we have code similar to the following do nothing or but abort current do nothing or but abort current some more calls to different method do nothing or but abort current you can several different method are called with the exact same object and for every call the same exception is caught and handled the same in a very the exception is not but may only be logged and then only reason why there is a around every single is to always execute all of the no matter if a previously executed method like the above code at it takes up a lot of is very repetitive the logging done in the not presented and just looks can think of some other ways to write this but like them very the following options came to my sequence or daily i i try switch case case case catch do nothing or but abort current is obviously bad very and looks reflection to get objects for the methods to call and store them in a list in the order they are supposed to be then iterate over this list and call the method using as only the exception is handled inside of the like this as bugs example typos in the method only pop up during runtime and the reflection api is somewhat a functor class like class void throws create a list of objects that call the like functors new public void public void iterate this list and call on every can summarize my feeling about this approach with two code i really like all four i would like to discuss this problem what do you feel is the best how did you solve similar problems in the is there maybe a much simpler solution i missed to best execute a set of methods even if an exception

a foreign key to a is the approach i in i use this even when i do use a database that supports enum i may skip the for the lookup and just use the actual value i need in my main table as the primary key of the lookup that way you need to do a join to get the table bugstatus status primary into bugstatus values table bugs serial primary summary status not null default foreign key references storing strings takes more space than implementation of but unless the table in question has millions of it hardly advantages of the lookup table are that you can add or remove a value from the list with a simple or whereas with you have to use to redefine the try querying the current list of permitted values in an for instance to populate a in your user a major with a lookup status from you can add other attribute columns to the lookup table if you need to to mark choices available only to in an you annotate the just simple option besides a lookup table would be to use the database supports them mysql table bugs serial primary summary status not check in this use of a constraint suffers from the same disadvantages as the hard to change the list of values without hard to query the list of permitted hard to annotate the equality comparison operator in sql is a single the double has no meaning in

a interface the controller handles the inputs from things like the keyboard and choosing which views to render and what changes to make in the model based on those the view and model can be more closely related because the view can register callbacks directly with the model entities to be notified of changes and thus be updated based on changes to the model directly instead of being updated by the the web views are necessarily more decoupled from the it must act through the controller actions because it has no direct access being rendered and delivered to the to the the controller takes a larger role in this environment even though the only it has to deal with are browser in a the coupling that used to occur with the view in mvc is transferred to the controller acting on its since there are no callbacks from the model to respond to forget about technologies for more business code is incorporated into the controller since the natural place to model business though perhaps not

a look at reactive there are a number of frameworks for this in haskell know about other most of which are based around the basic idea is to represent relationships between values and so for example you would write haskell arrow notation using no particular velocity expression of gravity position integrate second line declares the relationship between position and the arrow operators are syntactic sugar for a bunch of library calls that tie everything later on you might say something groundlevel getgroundlevel altitude getaltitude crashed lifta2 altitude declare that if your altitude is less than the ground level at your position then you have just as with the other variables is not just a single its a stream of that is why the function is used to the comparison operator from simple values to is not a problem in this inputs are time varying values such as joystick x and while the image on the screen is simply another time varying at the very top level your entire simulator is an arrow from the inputs to the then you call a function that converts the arrow into an io action that runs the you write this in lisp you will probably find yourself creating a bunch of macros that basically so it might be worth just finding out about arrows to start

a slightly different way to look at almost never makes sense when you are passing it as a pointer into a specific collection you are passing the collection as meyer was specifically stating that cannot be used with most member functions of a collection in that you will need a if you have a handle to the the only difference between the two is that you can modify what is by an and you modify the object referenced by a you want to use whenever you are passing a collection and position into the collection to an signatures make a whole lot of the implicit statement is that is free to modify the underlying collection but is not allowed to modify what that make much if you really want then should be an offset instead of an the flip most of the algorithms in the stl are based on ranges specified by a pair of the collection itself is never passed so the difference between and is whether the value in the collection can be modified through the iterator or without a reference to the the separation is pretty that made things as clear as mud

a your second take is the correct way of doing are you sure that the relation you sketched in your first take i would not be as but you know your domain better than op added a i really believe photos should ever belong to more than one event events are photo each photo is by definition from a certain and view by event is the only way to browse the pretty confident is are several lessons in that so i wanted to edit this to underline those the most important is that you model a schema without knowing two the real problem domain being what our solution requires of the initial guess was that the events and pictures were modeling the of photos at as in an art gallery a gallery of pictures on a web in that the ansel adams online gallery might very well have in which ansel adams photos are titled mature photos of or photos of all three events might include the lines in the mohave since many photos could be shown in many need a the is a and as the op any one photo is taken in one and ony one photo lesson here is that we model can only model until we know the problem also suggest that the table name be to make this ore calling it a or makes it more clear what we are the comment provides an answer to his objection that having an event fk in a photo is the op pretty astutely realizes that this avoid a and it forces the relationship to a instead of a join is an implementation the correct relationship is more as it is a modeling he should also realize is that in our and in the problem it makes sense to ask of a what photo was this photo and why not which session is a legitimate question about or attribute of a and the fk provides the answer to that it also means that in this the fk from photo to event be a photo have an a photo or else there could be no are a couple of additional lessons about what it means to have a a relationship or a and what it means to to make an fk nullable or leve those to another

absolutely it is just compiler glue to prevent you from doing something in the caller is responsible for maintaining the stack so the cast is necessary when you invoke the function arguments and the return value are pushed onto the this makes it since the stack will not likely be mutated the invoked function can still mess up the stack in certain rare should clarify that the assignment copies the function but in all function pointers are just the type and casting is all compiler the standard specifies that the behavior is undefined if the caller uses incompatible for casting a function which returns void into one which returns an int and then calling that the value is a good idea to cast the function into a compatible type before calling or you may see unexpected

am not sure i understand your here are a few tips that may help you which you have used to define weightmap requires that you add corresponding property inside your graph only did half of needed by defining this been help you in you want to add a different weight property for every different scheme you want to the alternative is to define such properties outside graph this can either be done using and is pretty simple but has the efficiency of a using which is more efficient underlying but requires a identifier ie a which can extract a numerical identifier between 0 and from provided this is typically defined within the my answer does not help you not please be a bit more precise in your question so i can update my answer	
am not sure why this question was down i think a great one thing to google and read some random websites which a lot of times are trying to sell you something rather than to be and another thing to ask so crowd which are mangers to share their and what works or work for their that this point is out of the i am sure a lot of developers will point you towards keep in mind that these terms are often used very loosely especially i am probably going to sound very controversial by saying this which is not my but these methodologies are especially scrum which is more of a product being marketed by scrum consultants than having said at the end of a you got to use what works the best for you and your if or go for at the same time you need to be flexible about become religious about any or if something is not working for or you can get more efficient by changing go for be more specific regarding your the basic summary of techniques that have been working for me lot of these are common all the and emails pertaining to a specific and make it accessible to others through a central location use ms onenote 2007 and love it for all my and bug meetings you should try to should be followed by action items where each item is assigned to a specific any verbal agreement should be put into a written all documents added to the project onenote in my starting any new have a written document of what the system will be capable of doing what it wont commit to but be flexible to business how detailed the document should detailed enough so that everyone understands what the final system will be capable are but be realistic and to yourself and business the basic guideline that i release and software that lacks some rather than a buggy software with all the open lines of communication among your team and between your developers and business but at the end of a one person a few key should be responsible for making key test where it makes but do not become obsessive about code coverage no and software works correctly according to the have code and code commit to but if it does not work for some situations allow for your code especially hard to but make it into a back and clean up you code if you already working on that implementing new working on a bug fix but refactor it just for the sake of unless you have nothing else to do and the last and more important not become religious about any specific methodology or borrow the best aspects from and find the balance that works for you and your

an alternative to using i sometimes define two helpful methods for my test takes a delegate and asserts that it throws the expected exception with the expected takes the same delegate and asserts that it does not throw an pairing can be very useful when you want to test that an exception is thrown in one but not the them my unit test code might look like callstartop check exception is thrown called when not check exception is now not and neat and methods are defined on a common base class as delegate void asserts that calling a method results in an exception of the stated type with the stated that calls the method to be expected type of the expected exception message fragment of the whole void type string did not raise any but one was catch ignore and rethrow nunit catch raised was not the expected raised did not contain expected expectedexceptionmessage got asserts that calling a method does not throw an this is typically only used in conjunction with once you have tested that an method throws an exception then your test may fix the cause of the exception and then call this to make sure it is now that calls the method to be void catch ignore and rethrow any nunit catch raised an unexpected	
an app to the document root would create a security hole since all your app files would be accessible to anyone if you secure them in any if you do not like the default symfony project setup which uses url rewriting for a single app only public one and want to have in other apps as you can create subdomains for them and set the parameter in to for this way you could have urls like in your the public app could be on and the admin app on of you would have to configure your apache vhosts accordingly this is not something that symfony does for you out of the	
an equality statement available because the iframe actually get the data while getting the data itself is not an ancient quirk of javascript that you can always get the object of a obvious security access most members of the there have occasionally been ways to circumvent these restrictions in the past due to browser but nothing you can rely much the only thing you can usefully do with an unknown window object is check to see if the same object as some other known window such as the current you want to test whether an unknown window is at least inside your own you can try to access inside a there any way to grab any information from the top from within an iframe on a separate but you can record the header at the http server end to see what page included the but surely your advertising network should be doing this for you already is the same thing as i know why ever use the longer the shortest idiom for this test works as long as you defining any other variables called or

an example that might be helpful for linux getexename get the filename of the currently running the function copies an absolute filename of the currently running executable to the array pointed to by which is of length if the filename would require a buffer longer than size null and errno is set to an application should check for and allocate a larger buffer if return null on with errno set and buf on the contents of the array pointed to by buf is undefined on this function is tested on linux it relies on information supplied the file the returned filename points to the final executable loaded by the system in the case of the filename points to the script not to the the filename returned points to the actual exectuable and not a char int get our pid and build the name of the link in pid if this should only happen on large word not what the proper response is since it really is an aborting program seems to be in now read the symbolic link ret in case of an leave the handling up to the caller if return report insufficient buffer size if errno return ensure proper nul termination return you use to find your then figure out where the symbolic link at points

and ssl are similar protocols that both use most of the same cryptographic primitives under the so they are both as secure as each one advantage of ssh is that using authentication is actually quite easy to and built right into the ssl a bit of a mess involving ca certificates and other after you have the pki in place you also need to configure your services to use the pki for authentication instead of its internal password this is a nightmare on some services and a piece of cake on it also means you need to go to the hassle of signing all of your keys so they can log in with competent users can grok ssh keys in no time but it takes a bit longer to get their heads around ssl keys extra ca certs and key certs confused me when i first discovered is great for unix but ftp over ssl is probably easier to do if your users are and are pretty clueless about anything other than internet exploiter you mind risking that your users will choose insecure

answer your first is performing the convolution of a with the reverse of v and giving the results clipped by the specified because of the of the correlation sum for i inf of where t even though this definition of the correlation would allow for results from to you obviously store an infinitely long so it has to be and that is where the mode comes there are 3 different mode returns results for every t where both a and v have some mode returns a result with the same length as the shortest vector or mode returns results only when a and v completely overlap each the documentation for gives more detail on the your second i think giving you the it is just giving you a little more as the autocorrelation is used to find how similar a or is to itself at a certain time at a time difference of the should be the highest because the signal is identical to so you expected that the first element in the result array would be the the correlation is not starting at a time difference of it starts at a negative time closes to and then goes that you were sum for i inf where 0 t what you got sum for i inf where t you need to do is take the last half of your correlation and that should be the you are looking a simple python function to do that would result return of need error checking to make sure that x is actually a this explanation probably the most mathematically been throwing around infinities because the definition of convolution uses but that necessarily apply for the theoretical portion of this explanation may be slightly but hopefully the practical results are on are pretty and can give you a much better theoretical background if you mind wading through the notation and heavy	
answer your i perform linq to sql directly in my layer or in a dal in a repository linq to sql specifically only makes sense if your database maps with your business in most enterprise situations not the case and is more having been linq in general is highly appropriate to use directly in your business because the linq provider that is linq to sql or something your the benefit of linq is that it allows you to be much more flexible and expressive in your business layer than but the code which makes both linq and the traditional dal code work are encapsulated away from having the same positive you believe we can truly use poco old clr when using linq to without more specific info on your poco problems regarding linq to difficult to you drop the facet for larger the mvc pattern in general is far more broad than a superficial look at mvc might by whatever you choose to use to connect to your data backing in your application becomes your if that is utilizing wcf or mq to connect to an enterprise data so be

approach dynamic is basically each substring of the original figure out all possible values it can in your first example can become either or may be a lot of different but many of them will be you should ignore all combinations that are greater than the when you add a or a you can envision it as combining two substrings of the since you have the possible values for each you can see if such a combination is values can be generated try splitting the substring in all possible and combine the different values in each half of the total number of is something like target for your example than the but if you had a string of length 1000 and a target of say then the problem would be solvable with dynamic

are a few reasons that i sometimes counsel people not to use certain cpan not all of cpan is and there are varying levels of maintenance for different everyone should consider how much work they have to do to use a particular cpan module and what that module saves them total cost of using any particular cpan module is not always a i say that people should not use any of but they should consider what they really need from external module dependency allows someone else to break your the cpan toolchain only ever cares about the latest version of a module and may upgrade your installation when it sees you have an earlier seen many applications break when the underlying external dependencies introduce new deprecated needed and so one of the reasons been developing my tools for companies to host their own cpan repositories so they can control there are other ways to mitigate but not many people are sophisticated enough to have a good process for work in an environment where all code has to be this seems like a silly requirement to a lot of but the risk management people have a job to do sometimes that compliance is mandated by various standards of and so unless the module is really going to save a lot of time and the benefit may not be worth the effort to go through that how many of you ever seriously inspect the code you get from there could be anything in cpan modules implement using a module just because on cpan and you want to write the three lines of code yourself is a bit you can talk about code reuse all you but eventually ad of some modules can be quite and and sometimes this is due to the long list of dependencies to just build and test the module even though you need those dependencies to actually use the it takes a lot of work to handle these cases in automated testing cpan authors are experimental not creating dependencies on their work means you end up with an unsupported module that get patched and no one else really cares getting your patches accepted is a really big deal for some important and you fix the unresponsive author without resorting to some process for using a locally patched version and overwritten by the cpan escape these reasons with glib answers about using another installing in a local and so you apply your counter arguments to every situation and anyone telling you such as the top post in seven reasons not to use that leon links really thinking about and there are many thoughtful ever start from the position of thinking anyone should or use evaluate the local evaluate the risks and develop safeguards for the and use modules not any different from any other sort of serious software development or business d

are smart to be thinking of designing a data layer in your in an application this will help you standardize and pretty dramatically simplify your data you need to learn how to create and use objectdatasources but this is quite other advantage of a data access layer using a separate is that it makes unit testing much also encourage you to build a business layer to do much of the processing of data business for would be responsible for pulling objectdatasources from the dal to hand to the ui not only does this let you encapsulate your business it improves the testability of the code as do want to be caching datasets dal for that in the you will build a web app so that record modifications work through a unique id other primary key and feed changes directly to the dal as they are if you were to cache everything you would reduce the scalability of your others on this thread are promoting the idea of using i would be careful about adopting a orm for reasons that i have previously outlined and i that it would be wise to avoid in my own i make extensive use of datareaders to fill my objectdatasources is trivial due to the design of my and find it to be very

asking for communications what really talking about is a hidden agenda in your specific bosses with hidden agendas are a tricky and sometimes dangerous sometimes that agenda can be sometimes it can be something your task is to get them to admit what the agenda while keeping their feathers need to both physically supporting paperwork and god forbid visual and if just getting some mental preparation will if you may be faced with generating performance failing to prepare is preparing to your target specific and keep the list small and if you have more than 5 asking for the average person handles only simultaneous at a and you want to vex them with need to set aside at least 15 if you get done it will be seen as a positive thing completed the meeting early and went on to other good warning you get more than 5 or they think that the 5 minute manager means everything is answered in 5 minutes or this is a bad really and you will not be able to break through your work issues because your boss has more or less erected a permanent i know this but if you get a time slot with them take your lunch with need to get your boss to agree to stop moving around at this i get to sit still and and not be distracted by other close the office door and keep it distractions are the unintended adhd syndrome of bosses and even a missed cell phone call can break a train of leading to heck i just get back to as an excuse to get out of the the whole point of getting time with them is to get their their on what you are trying to you are ready to communicate keep one rule in only speak when absolutely unless absolutely needed to confer the information your boss or if needed to keep the communication even bother openning your was remarkably in this is better to keep your mouth closed and let people think you are a fool than to open it and remove all this you need to approach and breach the you will want to do so in a you want to do so without generating the feeling that anyone you or your boss is at fault for the be presenting the issue in a manner that encourages you want this to be a positive impression and you will want to keep this the slightest hint of negative can often turn against i cannot give this enough negative and even negative are weapons in the hands of a bad boss with a bad agenda that targets do give them it will devolve into an opportunity to use any of this against wanna puke with the constant and but trust me on to put the thumbscrews to you if everything they try to use against you is a hopefully that the case and just a situation where a and this meeting will set you both on the right technical unless something going to hear over the long think of remember when was trendy how would you like it if your boss latched on to this term and used it for the next you cringe less and feel better when they if they used the correct this is the corollary to the when maxim above everything you say will be under a brilliant spotlight for a few and verbal gaffs will stick around long that they know what it is you assume that they also may harbor or any one of thousands of other personal or political also consider that they may be filtering what you say through those and get them to clearly define what they consider to be it might be something entirely different from what is called for in and that will touch back on the agenda just if their definition sounds even slightly do not let it ask them to clarify or provide additional what you want to accomplish is to get them to admit what their hidden agenda is in a polite manner that threaten it is sparkling what their agenda be sure to repeat it back to just to make sure i have it down you said you want accomplished by means of xyz within a given timeframe that you repetition back to them will give them a sense that their communcation was effective and provide a positive bosses like this because they feel their intentions are conveyed so this is a good should give you the critical insight have a better understanding of their expectations and like it or part of your job is to set if their expectations are or completely disconnected from the reality of the it falls to you to provide informative feedback that focuses on what they need to accomplish not if that feedback shows that their expectation is quickly it on their all needed is exactly that a on their part of what is really needed and really going the goal here is to start and establish an unbroken chain of communication between you and and that communication will only help everyone out over the long by this point you get a sense of what it is that they are then the situation is truly dire and not in a good working situation at either the boss is incompetent by lack of effective communication to their or they are not even close to competent in the field they are working or they have a hidden agenda that is adverse to either way on your way out in the long thank them for their assure them that the meeting was and and drop the whole in the stick it out and do the best you but start looking on your personal for work i truly hope this the but i have been in this situation at least and while pretty clear better off just getting out while you this on your good

assuming you want to still see stderr and stdout on the you could go for josh but i find keeping a around in the background which outputs your log file very hackish and notice how you need to keep an exra fd and do cleanup afterward by killing it and technically should be doing that in a is a better way to do and already discovered instead of just using it for your have a tee for stdout and one for how will you accomplish process substitution and file split it up and creates a fifo and lets listen on it uses to redirect the stdout of to the fifo that your first is listening thing for the use process substitution again to make a process that reads from stdin and dumps it into outputs its input back on but since its input is our we want to redirect stdout to our stderr then we use file redirection to redirect stderr to the input substitution is one of those really lovely things you get as a bonus of choosing as your shell as opposed to or have to do things

be you blame it all on ie microsoft certainly is by far the worst part of the problem with such large standards is that too much of a moving target to be perfectly implemented in a timely the release cycles of web browsers do not coincide with the release of new web so all browser developers can do is try to implement as many features as they can from the latest w3c selecting what will be the most commonly used features to implement things are clearly and it possible to support and still use proper css take a look at comparison of layout engines css if you look at the overall see that most browsers do tend to comply with established standards in the it just takes some browsers longer than others to implement a standard after its sometimes not that one browser is than with new standards the problem is often that different development teams chose to adopt of the new so even though css3 is already beginning to be implemented by most probably have to wait until css4 is published before seeing consistent support across all major rendering and if you try to use the latest css3 features right have a hard time establishing compatibility across all major but if using features introduced in no problem at the only from using ugly css to stick with then the problem is no longer to conform to web standards while supporting a particular instead the problem simply becomes to resist the urge to use the latest greatest css from the only permanent solution i see to this recurring situation is for the w3c to different parts of newly introduced specifications so that the new features can be implemented in discrete phases synchronized across all the major for grammar rules might be given the highest priority along with a set deadline for its after that would come the second which could be element attribute and so on and so would require a tremendous level of cooperation between the w3c and development but it would be worth after it does users and web developers no good for ie to implement one subset of features from css3 while firefox implements a different subset and the webkit browsers yet another a is no good until actually across all the major rendering better for each browser to support fewer new features but have them all be same than for them to separately introduce a ton of their own features that universally

been observing some strange behavior with the following i use instead of the directly so i can the variable separately for each form if return return upon calling on a it will disable normal submit and then make an ajax post strange thing is that the form gets posted multiple as the alert will as you can preventing this by using a saved on the form and checking that variable to see if the form has already been further it seems that the culprit is the script returned by the ajax let me explain a bit what doing so more form gets posted to the and a script the script shows the form but this time with error messages for some note that the form is completely upon showing the new executes have to do that because when you click on the submit button the form is submitted no say a user submits the form and returned back with the appropriate errors alert is not then he submits it this time the alert is shown now he submits it one more and this time the alert is shown and so it would seem that the callback is being appended again and again with each but it be that by using the original form is kept as a ghost or in case the script returned by the form and other stuff submitted multiple times when using the callback and to post

believe that there is a one place inwhich this information can be you can find out the last time a user logged on and what dc authenticated from but the problem is that when you login the first dc to respond is the server which authenticates that dc then logs this info to its which resides on each host and not in a central you can see more about this from these to so that being said i guess you could get the last login from the lastlogontimestamp ad property from the user account and then query the eventlog from all of the in the domain to find out which dc it was that authenticated them and from what but all of this will only tell the last lgged on all of teh systems that they could be logged again you could compare these results to the logoff times which can be pulled from the dc really this seems to be a major overkill and that you would have better luck writing a script which had these events logged to a central reporting system which you could use for future is another you can query your wins server to poll the logon information that it has for a which should return back the system inwhich it believes they logged see this post for how to do the command wins server show name username you are using some sort of management software such as desktop then you may have more luck exploring where the desktop agents log this information because they usually log this information also into some sql

bet that what is killing performance is allocating and releasing in each object allocates native which is why you have to this means each time you allocate and dispose a you have to transition from the jvm to native code and you cache your instances while in the 300x300 pixel loop and then dispose of the objects after your need a somewhat intelligent cache that only holds a maximum of so many and after that will dispose of some of its but this should speed things up

bugs are fairly easily and easy to what do you do when you run into ones that are hard or impossible to repro under of app is a app that is furthermore complicated by the fact that it communicates with multiple clients via remoting and sometimes bugs that can take weeks to track and sometimes we even be sure that the problem is fixed because of inconsistent it could be that just coincidence that the issue been seen for a already have an error reporting system so if lucky and the bug throws an exception get a stack but even not always enough because not obvious from the stack for instance how a certain value turned out to be null this is especially true when an exception occurs in a worker thread is the case most then you have ones that even throw just unexpected but it only happens a small percentage of is in so some of the work is hidden but we have many 3rd party components that managed code and a fair amount of com interop so it still gets a little no straightforward answers since not asking about a specific bug but what are some general concepts principles and tactics to go about tackling these kinds of is some advice for debugging really hard to track down

clever use of another tool freely available on windows the following two scripts do the job you get password with no set in do set this just to prove we have the get password with no echo then echo oscriptpw simply uses the password object to input the password from the user and then print it to standard output next paragraph will explain why that show up in the is a bit trickier command scripts usually set is somewhat sneaky the effect of the command is to output the prompt with no trailing newline character a sneaky way to emulate the command from the it sets to an empty string as an irrelevant side effect and wait for input since taking its input from the used this trick for things like this as well as providing progress bars in a command window fancy gui installs for my no sir in do set statement is the trickiest it runs the vbscript with no microsoft so that the only line output is the password the vbscript the delimiters to nothing is required to capture input lines with otherwise you just get the first the do set sets to be the actual password output from the we echo a blank line terminate the and echo the password so you can verify it works to imagine typed in is my the on the not is my is available with xp and 2003 but not later versions windows 2008 and windows i in order to rectify you simply copy the file from the folder of an xp or windows 2003 system to the or folder on your own once the dll has been you will need to register it by successfully register the dll on vista and you will need administrator

depends on the type of web applications can continue running even after exceptions have bubbled up to the execution is common practice to an exception if you catch the exception at a level where it be dealt you would almost always add context to the at the very least add some logging at the higher level to say that it was caught and example calls b calls c this you would want b to add some logging so that you can differentiate between b generating and throwing an and c generating and throwing an that would allow you a greater ability to debug and fix problems general you will almost never want an exception to kill your the best practice is to catch the except and exit this allows you to save any currently open information and release resources that are being used so they become if you intend to you can create your own information report that includes the things you were doing when you caught the fatal you let the exception kill your process you are eliminating your chance to get custom tailored crash and you are also skipping the part where you provide the user with a friendly error message and then i would recommend always catching and never voluntarily letting them run amok in your you are writing a you have to choose ahead of time whether your function will throw an or be exception in those sometimes you will throw an exception and have no idea if the calling party will catch but in that catching it is not your as long as the api declares that the function could throw looking for a word that means possibly throw anyone know what it going to bug me all

dictionaries of dictionaries are useful for other than performance they allow you to store context information about the data without having extra fields on the objects and make querying subsets of the data terms of memory it would stand to reason that one large dictionary will use less ram than multiple smaller if nesting each additional layer of nesting will roughly double the number of dictionaries you need to terms of query multiple dicts will take longer due to the increased number of lookups i think the only way to answer this question is for you to profile your own my suggestion is to use the method that makes your code the cleanest and easiest to of all the features of dictionaries are probably the most heavily tweaked for optimal	
diff functionality in git has it detects that a new file is actually a copy of an existing the diff output shows the differences between the source file and the new file rather than just a bunch of additions from a blank file to the new far as i can uses some heuristics to detect this unfortunately it is not detecting a particular new file as a copy of another file because i guess it has changed too still like to view the diff as though it were a is there a way to inform that the new file is a copy of another so that it will do this for i force git diff to treat a file as a

do this for any object in javascript will not be simple or you will run into the problem of erroneously picking up attributes from the prototype that should be left in the prototype and not copied to the new for you are adding a method to as some answers you will need to explicitly skip that but what if there are other additional methods added to or other intermediate that you know in that you will copy attributes you so you need to detect attributes with the addition to encounter a tougher problem when you try to copy objects that have hidden for is a hidden property of a an prototype is referenced with the attribute which is also and will not be copied by a loop iterating over the source i think might be specific to javascript interpreter and it may be something different in other but you get the not everything is you can copy a hidden attribute if you know its but i know of any way to discover it another snag in the quest for an elegant solution is the problem of setting up the prototype inheritance if your source prototype is then simply creating a new general object with will but if the prototype is some descendant of then you are going to be missing the additional members from that prototype which you skipped using the or which were in the but enumerable in the first one solution might be to call the source property to get the initial copy object and then copy over the but then you still will not get for a object stores its data as a hidden if obj typeof return var copy for attr in if return d1 new wait for 5 start start d2 date string for d1 will be 5 seconds behind that of a way to make one date the same as another is by calling the but that is specific to the date i think there is a general solution to this though i would be happy to be i had to implement general deep copying i ended up compromising by assuming that i would only need to copy a plain or the last 3 types are so i could perform a shallow copy and not worry about it i further assumed that any elements contained in object or array would also be one of the 6 simple types in that this can be accomplished with code like the handle the 3 simple and null or if obj typeof return handle if instanceof var copy new return handle if instanceof var copy for i len i return handle if instanceof var copy for attr in if return throw new to copy its type above function will work adequately for the 6 simple types i as long as the data in the objects and arrays form a tree that there more than one reference to the same data in the for this would be tree 3 this would but you would get 2 copies of the inner node instead of 2 references to the same directedacylicgraph 3 cloning this would cause a stack overflow due to infinite cylicgraph 3 will not be able to handle any javascript but it may be sufficient for many purposes as long as you assume that it will just work for anything you throw at

documentation for element states that the pointer is to an array that hold 5 values for each attribute number of attributes is returned in this means that every 5th value in the array is a new attribute five items for each attribute name of the namespace of the value pointer to the the xmlchar string for the pointer to the end of string for the you need to step through the get each value out of the items for the first then use the start value pointer to get the xmlchar string that is length end then start over with the next attribute till you read in that makes your head ache then i strongly suggest you switch to may require or use this link in which case you would get the attributes as an to get all the attributes out of it you could do the in nsstring do something here with attributename and you have access to the iphone developer site then look at the example

doing a import routine from one system to the first step is to import a lots of data from a lots of the first line in each is fieldnames tab the rest is the also tab separated and rows are separated with a have written a routine that creates the tables and reads in the data to a sql i set all fields that contains only numeric data and has in its field name as int and the rest as nvarchar i want to refine it so it looks at the data and try to find out what kind of data it contains in each there are and numeric know how to do its fairly but i want to know if there are some work done in this area and if there are some classes that handle this out out the preffered size is i think that i have to looking through all rows and find out the longest data for each have a lookup table where i map for example length to be length to be 255 and so have some smart imput on as i said its not anything particulary hard to but it would be nice to make a smart library of to use in other later out field type based on

done a fair amount of work on mvc on the and learning about it in my oop seeing some and i tell whether because the version of the mvc pattern is different than the traditional or whether i misunderstood my the model flat is a generic the view is what the user interacts and the controller mediates between the users actions and the the controller is the most and it manages the tells the model what it and tells the views what to we have the views matching what i just the model contains a list of the views so that it can update them when the data and the controller simply maps the actions to calls to the model and to specific objects may ask the model to update the what ends up happening is that most of the business logic is in the and tied very heavily to the simulation or application that is being while the controller is reduced to a mapping tool between commands and are your thoughts on the version of mvc different than traditional

generally very easy to add a soap header to your web serivce proxy in a quick code a new soap class soapauthheader string string your web service proxy class mywebservicesproxy public soapauthheader then to authheader new myproxy new there are other ways to this and microsoft do have a that includes taht gives much more functionality then the simple sample if you need kerberos tokens or certificate signing in your soap header then the way to if you jsut need to add a simple username and password for a web service operating over ssl then the exmaple may be all you blurb on earlier this decade when web services were going to take over the world a bunch of industry players sun got together to come up with standard ways of doing things over the body formed was since then microsoft has released a number of versions of its wse library to support some of the specifications but interestingly never been incorporated into the framework even though the first version was made public around services while still very popular and in my opinion a great way to integrate between different internet applications have gone a bit out of one of the reasons is undoubtedly because ajax and web services the best of bed although that has web services also get pretty complicated once you start including all the additional swse specs and one of the thinge web services was suppossed to solve was the complexity in other rpc corba in the meantime rest has gained a lot of popularity at the expense of web services and ajax libraries often prefer services going to disappear soon by any means but probably not going to take over the world anytime soon

going to say kind of sounds like a big m but so be of the things i got out of reading is kind of a meta is that there is no way of doing only for once you are versed in the practice of refactoring designs into you start worrying less about the shortcomings of the current code because you know you can fix it in the terms of all the stuff that goes on outside of as it i think you just have to get over it do what you need to do to get the code out the a little less but you can refactor the process as well once you learn what works for not saying that your learning about all this stuff should but that you need to be able to get things done in order for any of it to	
going with a network share i would go with a network enabled database instead of the situation your describing using access be a have used access in more challenging situations then this mostly when working with websites when access abused beyond measure it really that bad of a database talking about forms and stuff like that just tables and your doing from several users at once then it gets a bit this is the point where you start to think about real database when you want a low overhead database which is thread safe you can have a look at vistadb then not always think access uses table level locks with some kind of queeing mechanism things should work your worried about it you can always throw a simulated stress test at

got a custom web part with accordion panes from the ajax control toolkit as children that are used to render a site map each pane includes a div with text input and 3 linkbuttons used to edit the sitemap and all these controls are created in the overridden createchildcontrols the linkbutton is the event handler is and a new node is added to the when the postback the control should with the empty node in the but it after a new get the new node after reading for a i thought my problem was that i was creating my child controls too early in the process because createchildcontrols is called before control events are so i moved that bit to the onprerender but now the control events fire because hooking them up too late in the page lifecycle control events not question is how do i ensure that the custom control renders the results of its child control event an does it matter that doing this in a web part rather than a custom server control is the lifecycle a dynamic

got a situation with a large internal corporate web based application running on iis6 generating 401 responses followed by 200 responses profiled by aware of why this happening auth forcing the browser to resend but looking for some thoughts on how to minimise or eradicate the the application in question is running in the wan with some users experiencing latency of up to 250ms so forcing a subsequent request can have a noticeable impact on page load particularly when there are a number of cascading drop down lists on the pages users of the application are internal within a managed desktop environment so mechanisms to force the browser to send credentials on the first request this even could be possible from a deployment this would work for pages requiring the identity but for resources not requiring authentication and some custom web allowing anonymous auth would be looked at defining this on a per location basis in the but the results were mixed a number of 401 appreciate any guidance on a for dealing with this there are a lot of resources out there identifying the problem but none that found providing a feasible resources not requiring authentication web services used for cascading drop down can be requested anonymously through adding a location entry to the web config but yet to find an answer for authenticated 401 responses followed by 200

guess this is more a question about coding style than you have a straightforward with no there is little reason to mark the termination of the program by anything is not going to return anything that anybody can since your program ends is just going to exit with status which would happen naturally if the structure is more i would advise to the termination point by something to signal to someone who reads your code for that defined set of there is nothing to take into account there would use rather than for the simple reason that return can be mistaken for the end of a whereas exit very specifically states that the program at this	
guess you can for the record i leave my paragraph to explain why oracle behaves like that if you have a simple unique index on two will never accept two pairs if the columns are uniquely pair of 1 and a is considered an a pair of two nulls cannot be why it lets you insert as many pairs as you gets indexed because 1 can be next time you try to insert 1 is picked up by the index and the unique constraint is indexed because there is no value to be why it violate the unique

had good luck hiring open source maintainers to enhance libraries that we are some projects done in the needed to integrate quake 2 with we hired vadim a major contributor to in less than 4 he built a wxquake2 widget by adapting the windows version of quake we needed to portable access to raw so we hired vadim and worked with him to produce a new raw bitmap this involved a substantial bit of design but we really liked the resulting and we use it to this a later we hired another one of the core contributors to improve wxwidgets accessibility as it turned we ended up not using this code right for various technical but other people have been enhancing this code since and we hope to use it some other hiring open source maintainers is a lot like hiring any other kind of but some things are a bit some advice based on our have the most luck if you want to enhance an existing project and release the changes as open you want to hire members of the core they have the best track the most and they have the best chance of getting your changes merged want to get your changes merged if you be maintaining a local which is a do some who works on the features you care are they somebody enjoy working read the mailing lists and glance at the version control and pick out a few people to the design there may be a bit of the developers are looking at the larger health of the and looking at the needs of a specific this has occasionally made negotiations a bit more complicated for but the final result has typically been a better design than we would have chosen on our most be in any sufficiently large open source several members of the core team will already run consulting in smaller open source generally find several contributors who to run consulting if still hesitant to approach you can always you know anybody be interested in getting paid to work on if not you put them on the and they may tell you who to the been impressed with the professionalism and productivity of open source and i would recommend this route for

has been there appear to be any libraries to manipulate open xml documents in but has complete documentation on the format of open xml what you want is to send a copy of a standard document a form customized for each it should be fairly simple given that a docx is a zip file that contains various parts in a directory have a docx that contains all the parts and tree structure that you want to send to users no real then simply create new modify pieces that contain the content you want and inject it into the zip before sending it to the you could have that contains when a user requests the you replace with the then add the resulting to the zip file would contain all the images and other parts you want in the word and send that resulting document to the that if you rename a file to it is trivial to explore the structure and format of the parts you can remove or replace images or other parts very easily with any zip manipulation tools or programmatically with a brand new word document with completely custom content from raw xml would be very difficult without access to an api to make the job if you really need to do you might consider installing then use or to create your open xml documents using the xml format sdk since you would just be using the to manipulate open xml it should work okay in which seems to support everything the sdk

has recently put a release of their framework on devlabs with a commercial interested on using them in our project some to gradually replace all the custom validation but keen to know about the experience other people have had with it before we commit to you think the framework is sufficiently mature for large and complex commercial problems have you run into while using benefits have you got from it currently more pain than realise that this is a somewhat subjective question as it requires but given that this framework is a very significant part of and will change the way we all write validation i hope that this question will be left open to gather experience on the subject to help me make a decision to a answerable we be starting to use it next that we do not ship a code only a web service so for the majority of code breaking compatibility in terms of the exception type thrown is not a as hoping more people than just me will benefit from this post and its any detail around this area is more than mature is the microsoft code contracts

have a problem trying to layout my vs solution and i would like some my solution layout looks like the following mvc website calls various methods on the the idea here is that the handle all the the namespace are just namespace is self dependency with interfaces handles the black magic of the what layer requires what i wish to add some workflow foundation code the but put this wwf code the same do this i need to make another project of type this workflow has which call the as my website now has to call either the services method or the workflow to do was hoping that the website only ever calls the namespace to do the service is the main interface between the ui and the business the fact that i technically use wwf be a concern for someone coding in the iui the workflow dll calls methods in the services the services dll cannot call methods in the workflow because of also move all the workflow code into the services dll because the services dll needs to be some special project type type windows not sure what to can i make it so that the consumers only reference the services namespace for business stuff and the fact i impliment this business stuff in wwf is hidden from the i need to make a wwf project and move all my services code into the throw away the old service doing this sound very what happens if i decide to not use wwf for handling certain pipline actions and use something some code to help actionresult stockservice was created using constructor dependency var viewdata return class stockservice public dependency injection defines if the pipeline is or something else plain ole var stocks cache update of calling the skeet was return returns a to architect this

have a stored proceedure that i need to not exactly a dba here but no one else in my company is better than i the basic idea is i have a group of the user completes these tasks and gets a flag for each task to be considered the user has to have all of a group of given tasks the lynch pin is that some of those tasks my be wrappers for other groups of we have the following possible 2 4 5 7 a user has completed tasks 1 and they have implicitly completed task once they finish task have implicitly completed task another user finish tasks 2 and they will have implicitly finished if an assignment required only task it would by extension be requiring tasks 6 and which would required 1 and have five basic usertaskassignment and i omit the user and assignment table as key on key on key on key on key on key on if it is key on key on user gets assigned a usertaskassignment which requires task 4 to be i want to build a stored proceedure that would check the usercompletedtasks against the checking if there is appropriate pseudo code would like taskscompleted tasksrequired new task in else return return just know internals well enough to translate this into a stored last resort is i pull the code into the application but this would really fit at the data any help would be greatly was pointed out compoundtask entries could themselves be compound thus you would need a recursive drill to get a list of all the tasks that would need to be i expanded the example above to exemplify mysql stored	
have a subclass of manually to a set of hierarchical i want the user to be able to edit the labels of the and have the changes reflected back to the so i set to true and overrode to the tune override void treenode node if mydatanode datanode as int oldindex int newindex treenode parent the data and returns the index into which the change node moved after i was hoping i could simply move the edited node to reflect this problem is that this causes the node to in edit tried calling cloning the node before inserting setting to false and back to wrapping the change in and various combinations of these but none of them have any culprit seems to be the even if i attempt to insert a totally it will go into edit mode is there any way to make not behave this and if is there a good ideas a custom would prefer not to have to sort my data a flag and delay the step until some point after it works to do it during but this feels like a big kludge that is likely to fail to push the step back onto the message queue like works and seems cleaner to me than but i know this is probably not how was intended to be and that it may have repercussions that my very limited knowledge of the message pump cannot i insert nodes into a treeview during afterlabeledit without beginning to edit	
have a system which been wrestling with for a it uses a lot of abstraction to deal with the fact that later extension is not just but one place this is required is data the system generally deals with managing objects encapsulating some observation the sense of an observed value or set of and using to this i have something to the effect interface observation uniquekey is used to an observation uniquekey interface retrieves an observation from the actual data performs any necessary operations to encapsulate values in observation problem arises for specific implementations of these the and class are implemented with specific runtime may also be extended to deal with whatever the uniquely identifying set of values are for an observation in the data source an maybe a so any implementation of will expose a but expect a specific i expect the to be casted to a specific type once passed seems like a poor design since the implementation is lying about the argument requirements but i see another way of doing i expect other people to be using these so i just say that remember this ideas to fix it or handle it more exposes type but implementation requires type b of

have a variety of problems in your you should not embed your connection string in code you should pull it from a config file so that you can change it when you log in to your database with the sa just do it trust me on this strongly recommend that you use an idisposable interface and a using block to ensure that your connection is as it you are depending on the consuming code to call this sample class myconnclass public static string connectionstring protected sqlconnection public conn new public void your initialization code in a web set the static connection string as your consuming classes use something myconn new database the other thing i would suggest that you consider is to modify the above code so that it forms the basis for a data access layer and not just the that place a sql command object in there as well and create code to simplify your overall data access that just putting the in a separate class is a bit useless as joel points sqlconnection objects are themselves the advantage of a full blown dal is that it can radically simplify your data for my dal me write things myquery new return end up with the class that i did but hopefully you can see a few the connection string is never an issue in my code is i can run multiple commands without all the set up and tear down usually and the overall syntax is more

have created a dynamic typing system in c in order to create a dictionary that can contain values of different bit the structure of the dynamic object unsigned char need to compare two of these dynamics that hold a2d readings and then compare the difference against a delta value to determine if a change has one solution i have been able to come up with is to cast them to char arrays and compare them byte by but that smell i also have an idea to make an array of function pointers based on the number of bytes perhaps the the dynamics take up and just make a comparison function for each type can anyone suggest a different it feels like i am missing for telling me about but i still have the problem of how do i get the delta of the two from what i can memcmp just returns an indicator of which value is not the difference between to turns out that memcmp is useless to me because the architecture i am compiling against is little i were going to do a bignum implementation myself then ephemient feels like the right way to but i have decided i am just going to memcpy the values into the largest possible type unsigned long that i will have to deal with and just work the math using i think of any reason why this would not but i recognize that i could be very wrong as c direct memory manipulation is not my two values that have an arbitrary number of bits in

huge problem that caused us a lot of grief was using modules classes in our main web this was before we really knew what we were doing and has since been big problem with using modules is that by default any module level variables are visible to every instance of the asp worker we pass in multiple datasets and manipulate them then return them to the because we were using modules the variables holding these datasets were getting corrupted by multiple calls occuring at one was not caught in testing and was difficult to reproduce until we figured out how to properly load test our web it took something like requests per second before we could reproduce it the we just changed all the modules to and then used those classes instead of calls to the this cleared up this concurrency issue as each instantiated class had its own copy of the dataset in

i realise that this is a very similar question to this but all the answers to that one were java centric so i am asking this time looking more for little i recently read excellent book on and i just got hold of i am sure is also but i have only just opened these are python and java i have any trouble reading the code but as i am a developer it would be fun to play with some of these ideas in my native had a search of the web and so and not come up with too in a way this is great maybe i could port something to but also really like to take a look at any existing projects before i do are there an ci fans out there working in with os have i missed some glaringly obvious and interesting realise ci is a pretty broad so to narrow it down a little i am primarily interested in the clustering prediction but am open to other just spotted this book about to be published by manning which may interest ci of the intelligent clarification in response to comment by what i am looking for really is frameworks or projects that use ci techniques with code samples are but as moose said in his comment it is easy enough to take java examples and port for there is an interesting looking project written in java called there is no reason i use this and experiment with i was just curious to know if there were similar things going on in i have just been browsing info on and i see that there is a port of so a are there any more out this is not but it is robert pickering has started collection ci resources looks but still looking for info for collective intelligence

i want to state that silverlight 2 does not support element to element that feature is added in silverlight 3 in beta having said i think you want to bind controls together it sounds like trying to build a numericupdown control and you probably have some class in code behind actually doing the incrementing and the you can simply subscribe to the click handlers and call a method on your model like increment or your model can expose a property for the current value and that property is what is bound to your text if actually trying to build a numericupdown you might want to check out the silverlight the toolkit already includes this control and it also supports data out the numericupdown control and download the toolkit binding from a child control to a parent control really any the parent usercontrol has a datacontext and all child controls inherit each individual child control can also have its datacontext binding expressions are always relative to the datacontext and the datacontext can be set in in your probably to a model of some hope that bienz

i work primarily on intranet apps this been too much of an issue with i often do apps for other departments and especially when the project is we do sign a memorandum of understanding with regard to the project and since i work in an agile none of those things are which is often hard to explain to other departments that worked this way typically i will include a description of the process itself a couple of paragraphs explaining how the project is a cooperative venture between them and that together we determine when the time the mou is actually already invested a number of hours in the project discovering what the requirements are are handled at a standard hourly based on that coupled with an estimate of my velocity and similarity to previous i give an broad estimate of the amount of time and cost for the required features again that the real cost is determined by which features we actually implement and how long it really this takes a fair amount of but since been working together to develop the requirements i usually have that with the individuals that dealing with i often try to leave the actual estimate out of the but will include it if their i do try to give them a budget experience is that once the project starts and you start delivering value to the they are rarely they ask for pay more than the original project we both agree that some of the original features are not but i always expect after they really have no way of knowing for sure until they actually see things in operation what it is that they really more often than we drop some features and add others based on the actual i suppose if we there be any point to using agile think the key issue is suggest working with a new customer on smaller projects or explicitly breaking a large project into smaller projects to develop once they and you know that you can trust each other to build the right product with the right i think the risk and there always is one of the customer pulling out abruptly is

idea is that given a specific input to the somehow i want to automatically through the complete program and dump its control flow along with all the data being used like classes and their is their a straightforward way to do or can this be done by some scripting over gdb or does it require modification in the reason for this question is because of an idea regarding a debugging what it does is given two different inputs to a one causing an incorrect output and the other a correct it will tell what part of the control flow differ for what i think will be needed is a complete dump of these 2 control flows going into a diff and if the two inputs are following similar control flows then their diff would many give a good idea about why the bug can be made into a very engaging tool with many features build on top of complete control flow through

important to understand why the overhead of an http request has such an its simplest an http request consists of opening a sending the request on the open socket and reading the open a the stack sends a tcp syn packet to the the server responds with a and the client responds to that with an before you send a single byte of application you have to wait for a whole one and a half round trips to the at the client needs to send the wait for the server to parse the find the requested send it back another round trip plus some server side overhead a small although seen some slow plus the time to transmit the actual and the best assuming no network congestion which would result in packets being dropped and chance you have to avoid you browsers will issue multiple requests in parallel in an attempt to reduce some of the overhead http requests can theoretically be done on the same making things a little but in network round trips are bad for and should be

is a hash which is a one way turning an input of any size into a output bit in this a cryptographic hash function is one for which it should not be possible to find two inputs giving the same output except by brute force with a function you should need to try on average message to find such a due to something called the birthday paradox google it for fact for sha1 this is no longer the case the algorithm is cryptographic terms at broken with a collision attack described by xiaoyun wang et al that beats a classic birthday the sha2 family is not and a process is underway by nist to agree on a sha3 algorithm or family of is an asymmetric encryption encrypting an input into an output that can then be decrypted a hash algorithm which be it uses a different key for encryption public than for decryption private this can therefore be used to receive encrypted messages from others you can publish your public but only you with the private key can then decrypt the messages that have been encrypted with you reverse the keys for it can be used to generate a digital signature by encrypting something with your private anyone can decrypt it with the public key if they are sure the public key belongs to then they have confidence that you were the one who encrypted the this is normally done in conjunction with a hash function you hash your then encrypt that with your private giving a digital signature of a fixed length for your input	
is a huge and employs many techniques to achieve the high compression rates that it is capable video compression is concerned with throwing away as much information as possible whilst having a minimal effect on the viewing experience for an end for using subsampled yuv instead of rgb cuts the video size in half straight this is possible as the human eye is less sensitive to colour than it is to in the y value is and the u and v values represent you can throw away some of the colour information which reduces the file without the viewer noticing any most compression techniques take advantage of 2 redundancies in the first is temporal redundancy and the second is spatial redundancy notes that successive frames in a video sequence are very typically a video would be in the order of frames per and nothing much changes in of a take any dvd and pause then move it on one frame and note how similar the 2 images instead of encoding each frame other compression only encode the difference between successive frames to find the difference between redundancy takes advantage of the fact that in general the colour spread across images tends to be quite low by this i mean that neighbouring pixels tend to have similar for in an image of you wearing a red all of the pixels that represent your jumper would have very similar it is possible to use the dct to transform the pixel values into the frequency where some high frequency information can be thrown when the reverse dct is performed the image is now without the thrown away view the effects of throwing away high frequency open ms paint and draw a series of overlapping horizontal and vertical black save the image as a jpeg also uses dct for now zoom in on the notice how the edges of the lines are not as sharp anymore and are kinda this is because some high frequency information transition from black to has been thrown away during this for an explanation with nice further is quite if a little heavy on the

is a really hard question to answer because it depends on what code will be affected and how critical that code and when migration is a nontrivial do yourself a favour and upgrade to the latest version of which would be java 6 not java java 6 has been out for a year and a half or more and is no reason to not pick it over java 5 like any software your goal should be to get something into production as soon as you possibly so you need to identify a slice of your the smaller the the more the other thing to do is just try starting up your app under java 6 and seeing what it might be worse than you it might be much other thing probably need to be aware of is that by the sounds of it you will have in your app that have since been some may not even be compatible with java beyond you will probably want to upgrade all of these to the latest version as will probably mean more stuff breaking but using apis is just kicking the can down the street and causes you other are exceptions to this where upgrading can have axis1 to axis2 comes to those situations require more careful for what features are all of them pretty i think of any that should be avoided off the top of my i just noticed the size of your actually quite small written an app about that size in the last 3 months by this also depends on how easily you will find things that if you have good unit test coverage then pretty rare if you can just run through the app and reliably find problems not too problematic situations are where scenarios are hard to test and likely you uncover problems straight that calls for more

is a throwback to the old when compiler technology for what we would now call basic math was still evolving compiler evolution is more focused on exploiting new instructions for niche and so such as the ones you mention were when evaluating the efficiency of the hotspot compiler when java was first and in evaluating the efficiency of versus suggestion that and system calls are the likely bottlenecks is at least for some space of but i notice you suggested string one irrelevant is another critical performance i also remember using linpack and other to compare versions of the and to compare vendors of the from v4 to v5 there was a big jump in i guess the jit compiler got more jvm was ahead of at that on	
is a time when i consider not using and that is in writing compact framework the cf jit compiler does not perform the same optimisation as the desktop jit compiler and does not optimise simple property so in this case adding a simple property causes a small amount of code bloat over using a public usually this be an but almost always in the compact framework world you are up against tight memory so even tiny savings like this do

it is worth worrying about in md5 is so badly broken that have been able to forge fake certificates that matched a real certificate signed by a certificate this meant that they were able to create their own fake certificate and thus could impersonate any bank or business they felt like with browsers completely trusting this took them a lot of time and effort using a cluster of playstation and several weeks to find an appropriate but once a hash algorithm only gets never if you care at all about it would be better to choose an unbroken hash such as one of the has also been though not broken as badly as md5 the technique used in the link that i provided you involved being able to choose two arbitrary message prefixes and a common from which it could generate for each prefix a block of data that could be inserted between that prefix and the common to produce a message with the same md5 sum as the message constructed from the other i cannot think of a way in which this particular vulnerability could be exploited in the situation you and in using a secure has for is more resistant to attack than using it for digital but i can think of a few vulnerabilities you need to watch out which are mostly independent of the hash you your algorithm involves storing the password in plain text on the this means that you are vulnerable to any information disclosure attacks that may be able to discover passwords on the you may think that if an attacker can access your database then the game is but your users would probably prefer if even if your server is that their passwords not because of the proliferation of passwords many users use the same or similar passwords across information disclosure attacks may be possible even in cases when code execution or privilege escalation attacks are can mitigate this attack by storing the password on your server hashed with a random you store the pair on the and send the salt to the client so that it can compute to use in place of the password in the protocol you this does not protect you from the next an attacker can sniff a message sent from the he can do an offline dictionary attack against the most users have passwords with fairly low and a good dictionary of a few hundred thousand existing passwords plus some time randomly permuting them could make finding a password given the information an attacker has from sniffing a message pretty technique you propose does not authenticate the i know if this is a web app that you are talking but if it then someone who can perform a dns hijack or dhcp hijacking on an unsecure wireless or anything of the can just do a attack in which they collect passwords in clear text from your the current attack against md5 may not work against the protocol you md5 has been severely and a hash will only ever get never do you want to bet that you will find out about new attacks that could be used against you and will have time to upgrade hash algorithms before your attackers have a chance to exploit it would probably be easier to start with something that is currently stronger than to reduce your chances of having to deal with md5 being broken if just doing this to make sure no one forges a message from another user on a forum or then unlikely that anyone will put the time and effort in to break the protocol that you if someone really wanted to impersonate someone they could probably just create a new user name that has a 0 in place of a o or something even more similar using and not even bother with trying to forge message and break hash this is being used for something where the security really then invent your own authentication just use one of the fundamental rules of cryptography is to invent your and then even for the case of the forum where it probably matter all that it be easier to just use something proven off the shelf than rolling your	
it not possible to use a sqldatasource in an aspx page inside a silverlight and	
it possible that someone can their own code during if the download is done via unencrypted then being routed through a number of and there most definitely is an opportunity for people to manipulate it and insert a trojan or this is exactly the goal of the md5 checksums for though this is of course not perfect since the checksum may be manipulated in the same but it would require more effort and coordination on the part of the in this is not a very common problem since there are other vectors of attack that are currently much more useful for bad guys webbrowser	
it possible to consume a php webservice in visual i have a webservice with a wsdl file created by when i try to add the web reference in visual studio the name of the service and the methods show up but it complains that the is not a known document and the discovery document could not be suggestions would be to there is no asmx file at the since the app is using the functions of the php webservice and not the other way maybe nusoap can create a i think that is just for the side trying with nusoap because it automatically creates the wsdl for however i did try the inbuilt soap handing of php first with my own wsdl file but got the same error as with the problem in the end was really my my files where encoded in utf8 and it like thanks for the answers a php webservice in visual

loop will kill a table like table number int not null primary has rows containing values 1 to 8000 or so and use this function the character to split the string the list to split rownumber takes the given string and splits it apart based on the given a table is one row per split with a columns named and this function workes for fixed or variable lenght empty and null items will be included in the results the list to split the character to split the string defaults to a comma a one row per item in the with a column name from formed as from employee inner join dt on where is not formed list as from employee inner join dt on formed as from will return empty and row into by as as from select as as inner join numbers n on where have other versions that do not return empty or null ones that return just the item and not the row look in the header comment to see how to use this as part of a which is much faster than in a where

main advantage is that you can limit which values you can enter in the if you try to enter a value that exist in the referenced you be able to do if you update or delete the value in the referenced you can set it to automatically update the value or delete in cascade any row containing that indeed a great feature leveraging your	
main argument for method 2 is that you get implicit type conversion on both not just the second this might save confusion somewhere down the of your example code defines implicit conversions from int to a and from int to via the constructors on both this could result in ambiguity but if you left out the for fair agree with if you find yourself doing you may be writing an api that others will find how come an a plus a b is an does it really make things easier for users that they are adding a and rather than calling getx themselves and adding the it because users know perfectly well that a and b are wrappers for if then another option is to expose conversions from a to int and b to via operator then will return an int for a sensible and get all the other arithmetic operators a int explicit operator return b int explicit operator return a b a b a b

my opinion the code repository should only contain source code as well as third party libraries required to compile this source code the third party libraries might be retrieved with some dependency management tool during the build the resulting binaries should not get checked in along with the source think the problem in your case is that you have proper build scripts in why building a binary from the sources involves some work like starting up importing the adjusting there are build scripts in getting the binaries can be done with a command ant think the most important reason not to checkin the binaries along with the source is the resulting size of your this will repository and maybe too few space on versioning system of traffic between versioning system server and the update times you do an svn update from the reason might code is easily so lots of the features of a versioning system do make but you easily compare your approach as described above introduces a lot of overhead in my what if a developer forgets to update a corresponding jar

observe a phenomenon that looks like religion to only in a development here is an example are three people working on a small the project will involve a public web service that will serve requests by fetching data from a and also a separate component that would fill and update this all three of us care a lot to make this project but we come from different one of us has only done java development enterprise java while two of us have only done choosing what to develop the project as you may each one stood his ground and insisted we use the technology he knows other than we are good and we are determined to work not a but think that two of us being more productive is a good argument to use the java guy on the other hand is also an and thinks that using free tools would be decisive for the started with a using for development and a mysql which appeared to be a huge not because we make it but because of all the overhead to make the two it would have been a snap if we used with sql server or php and mysql those pairs are just made to work with each real problem in this case is that whatever we at least one is going to make a compromise and not be and of the whole which is not how do we work this how do we work out religious differences between i know that every good programmer have a problem working with a foreign but i need such what if any of us converting is not an out religious differences between developers in a team

of the best books is mentioned the series because it gives great analogies and are also other decent java design pattern books web sites that are specialized on the subject posts above for the of book was my first read on this it is my opinion that you should avoid it especially if your starting at the time this was the but today many books exist giving you many to choose and i clearly emphasize this practice is the ultimate learning after having read several books on the i was certain of knowing and understanding these when i attempted to actually implement some of them i soon realized that my knowledge was mostly and my comprehension even a huge blow to my set out to test and challenge my peers and quickly learned that they were in the same boat as i i find that of programmers proclaim to know patterns but when really put to the only about actual know the subject set out to implement as many patterns as i could in one or more complex i put theory to practiced and what i learned was a gold of the most challenging aspects of my experience was that each pattern alone look but sometimes linking a bunch of patterns together can be even more encourage you to put theory to

of the simplest solutions to the question is the following xpath that no xslt instruction is involved this is just an xpath so the question could only be tagged here one could use this xpath expression in xslt in various such as to apply templates upon all selected below is an xslt transformation that takes the xml document and produces another in which all elements children of whose contents is not equal to are this transformation is applied on the original xml wanted result is a match pattern we typically do not need to specify an absolute xpath but just a relative so the full xpath expression is naturally simplified to this match

only agile projects i have ever worked on were either in time and materials or pay per cycle trouble as you have pointed that there is a risk of a project that the same as any if you go you take all the if you go fixed price the customer takes all the by going pay per cycle you are taking most of the but are passing small chunks of it onto the customer one cycle at a as it happens neither you or the client want to take any risk at which is why you have posted this trouble is taking risks is what business is all the more risk you take the bigger the profit when it comes but also the bigger the loss if it if the risk is too great for you to handle the only solution is to find someone else that can take the risk off your but you are going to have to pay if neither you nor the client are prepared to take it then there are probably only two some rich fool to underwrite the risk get the risk out amongst a number of people until the risk each one takes is so small that it is think this second option is what makes contactors so because they are easy to get rid they end up taking the risk of an early project as the risk would be spread between a number of the risk is spread to an acceptable they will charge you more than an employee because of the extra but that is what you get for trying to avoid the risk

part of a large automation we are calling a api that does some work calling services on another we discovered recently that every so often when the other machine is the api call will spin away sometimes up to 40 minutes while attempting to connect to the remote api using offer a way to specify a timeout and we want our program waiting around for that so i thought threads would be a nice way to enforce the the resulting code looks something thread new if throw new attempting to i want to let but if it is still going after timeout has assume it is going to kill it and move new to threading in and on the runtime i thought ask two related there a appropriate mechanism in the libraries for what trying to and have i committed any threading gotchas in that bit of reasonable use of threading in

php version is out of php has been in the area for awhile and while there are not massive there are enough changes that i would say to test anything older is an unfair is on the verge of becomming final and you should include that in your benchmarks as there are massive improvements to php as well as being the last version of if you really want to split hairs php 6 is also in and a heavy overhaul totally different languages can be interesting but forget you are comparing apples to and the biggest bottleneck in any app is waiting on so the biggest factor is your database comparing php vs python vs purely on speed is pointless as all 3 of them will execute in less than 1 second but yet you can easily wait seconds on your database depending on your hardware and what you are you are worried what is taking the absolute wrong approach to choosing a there are more important such as in how easily can i find skilled devs in that how much do those skilled devs how much roi does the language how feature rich is the

pipes give you full duplex so it will be a little bit more complicated if you need to provide just one you know if your applications needs to seek through the file your application work with stdout a solution is to create a mini compressed file system that contains only a directory with your you have separate input and output file you can do the following your inputfile readfifo writefifo youroutputfile your program you probably will get in trouble with the read twice in order of the because as soon as zcat is finished reading the input yout program will get a sigpipe proper solution is probably to use a compressed file system like because then you have to worry about unsupported operations like

porting a sdk from windows to mac osx i have a problem in xcode where my breakpoints in certain files will only be hit if i set them while if i stop debugging and then the breakpoints no longer get if i add them while not they get this is only in certain files and my breakpoints are always dark i tell the difference between a breakpoint that will get hit and one that my sdk is made up of various dynamic these are built using perforce which calls the various compile and link executables depending on my os and compiler version as visual and i have a simple command line application that links to these dynamic libraries and calls code in this application on windows is a visual studio in which i set breakpoints on library code and expect them to be created the same command line utility application in xcode that links to the sdk dylibs and calls code in some of the breakpoints work i can set breakpoints in code called from the troublesome and step out to the troublesome which i can then step through the troublesome code is compiled into the same dylib as code that works also long and complicated enough not to be a candidate for tried the load symbols lazily with both gcc and gcc a full clean and the files of the xcodeproj the files so they clash with system everything out of the breakpoints a new xcode application is compiled in debug with dwarf format and my libraries are built with the flag with i386 and would be much sorry for not updating my mac port project was i never resolved but discovered that it actually only occurs in constructor revisit this as and when i hit the problem breakpoints only hit when set during

preferred way of doing this would be to using a compression tool like and make it part of the build process the compression ratio be so or you can use point being that you miss the greater performance problem given of the main problems with compression by iis is that it pack all the files into a single so if your site has 7 js files and 20 css this is very it will take 27 http round trip to get your writing a http handler to do this is a good idea for people with shared simple build algo would be to have a file in the root your js file in order to the make and pass it as params to to all the above release mode you page master should only refer a to get yui and nant justin etheredge has released an awesome tool to combine and compress file called

pretty sure that requests for static files do not go through the framework only files that end in so a request for a static file that exist will get a 404 from but not get processed by could do a similar thing to as described on this page under the heading custom 401 gist of it is to create a custom error handler in iis that sends the user to a certain static htm which redirects them to your special 404 handler aspx

probably a good idea to keep the concepts is a and it specify anything about what platform should be in straight code could be compiled to native x86 java msil or anything else you care to think i believe adobe recently made a compiler which generates flash with typical microsoft has created two languages targeting they made the extensions for then they decided it ditched it and tried to pretend it never their best bet for is called but is not it extends and changes the language in a number of nonstandard i believe the standard committee requested that they change the name to avoid but they studio 2005 and newer supports listed under visual think it was that did microsoft has done it after specifying which is actually a reasonably attempt at integrating with they realized that virtually no one uses out that even programmers generally prefer to use when working in and native focusing on making interop between and simpler and more likely to go it and in some cases just not the they originally hoped studio also supports native compiled to x86 machine untainted by these are listed in the dialog under visual if you want to learn you have two which limits you to a language which generates msil instead of native machine and requires to and generally worth the bother because if going to take a dependency on why not write in learn proper which is completely separate from and directly reference key takeaway point is that separate either you compile as which means the compiler will allow you to reference and will generate msil or you compile as in which case the world a note of despite my wording above and by in many it is not faster has the to be but it depends a lot more on the compiler will turn pretty much anything into reasonably efficient on the other is full of pitfalls that will make your code than the equivalent and the blog posts it references are worth a read for anyone curious about the performance of similar code written in the two is only one area where applications will be consistently and in startup a application may have to load the framework and jit the msil where a native just other than it is probably a mistake to assume that will be it because it gives you a bit more but that just means the compiler is less able to save you from the inefficiencies you create in your

rather ugly solution that may or may not be practical is to leverage an existing regex diagnostics some regex libraries have the ability to figure out where the regex failed to in this you use what is in effect a form of brute but using one character at a time and trying to get longer strings until you got a full this is a very ugly unlike a standard brute force it failure on a string like ab will also tell you whether there exists a string which will match stop and try if try a longer this is probably not feasible with all regex the bright this kind of solution is probably pretty cool from a teaching in practice probably similar in effect to a dfa but without the requirement to think about that you want to use random strings with this you can use random characters to start with if you keep track of what tested in a so the effect is the

read this article and thought of it when seeing your hope it a primitive polynomial over one can obtain another primitive polynomial by decimating an lfsr sequence obtained from the initial this is demonstrated in the code c in order to generate an lfsr we must first multiply this polynomial by a suitable constant so that the trailing coefficient becomes c we are now able to generate an lfsr sequence of length 72 the initial state can be anything other than lfsrsequence 5 we decimate the sequence by a value d having the property 6 b to get the corresponding primitive we multiply by a constant to make it b

really all across the on one end of the worked in one place where the code was recently rewritten in recently being 10 years everyone was highly skeptical of this farther down the find c programmers who happen to have compilers with features dabble in the but other than they are practically writing in down the line i think find those who just groked inheritance and these are the kind of guys and gals that would swoon over an mfc or wxwidgets thinking it was the go a little farther and find the folks who just read they are all about figuring out how to use stl got a basic notion of templates that equates mostly to the way stl uses got the modern template metaprogramming many of us these days use their work in the form of boost and all its few actually dork around with template probably a good have seen perfectly good code written at each cool thing i always liked about is that at each level of added the cost could be conceptualized in terms of this new abstraction might be implemented in so i can conceptualize that inheritance and polymorphism is adding the cost of a function pointer since i have seen this and written this in i know what in i also have a sense of how templates work in part because of how the preprocessor works in this applies to most features in the and c easy to map concepts to how they are implemented in i can easily visualize how the underlying architecture runs my

really like the concept of modular bundles as implemented by also like services like google appengine web or java webstart client two ideas seem to complement rather well the osgi standard includes a couple of features that make it impossible for implementations like felix or equinox to run on top of sandboxed virtual such as appengine or in these it is not possible to get direct access to a file for which precludes the osgi bundle cache that is used to store persistent bundle state and native i have no great interest in using native libraries or have persistent bundle is there some framework that implements the core bundle and services concept of osgi in a compatible way so that osgi bundles can be deployed into it as but can work without a bundle cache other facilities not available in a am looking for something like a limited version of felix that works on appengine or if the webstart engine and the google appengine just provided osgi framework services that would be another very limiting aspect of appengine is that you cannot start new this prevents other asynchronous bundle obviously not an issue with that can run in a sandbox appengine or

reason they generate two different sql queries is that by tries to optimize your sql queries for fewer when you include a list of conditions as part of your find that require the use of other tables then of course the resulting sql has to include a but if all asking to do is to objects with relationships to the objects retrieving then rails figures more efficient to perform several fast queries rather than one big slow that this does not cause an because rails will try to load all of the associated records in a single	
recently been reading louis book on sql server database design and found it quite picked up on alot of concepts that i previously know alot primarily i picked up on a way to set up database relationships that i tried you use a surrogate key as the tables pk auto incremented id and then set up one or more alternate keys consisting of one or more unique theese alternate kays would then be the values used for relationships the if that makes more sense for the given remodelled an old database that was suffering from some data inconsitencies due to poor design to implement to new way of a database level it works tha relationships function the way supposed to and the constraints are enforced in a reliable cannot get it to work properly in either the entity framework or in linq to sql i read that in v1 of it just flat out support this kind of relationship so i moved to linq to sql to see if things would work out they seemingly as i got all the relationships automatically mapped out when i imported the classes from my the problem is that i save data to the database because of invalidcastoperation exceptions as soon as i try to save i have a couple of this a limitation in linq to is there a way to work preferebly without for update and delete safety is something i to this way of designing hope someone can shed some light on as getting quite frustrated about i really find any good material on the subject online so hopefully someone here has an answer or can point me in the right i ended up doing was this i went back to using the entity framework in conjunction with a redesign of the database i remodeled the relationships to rely on primary keys rather than alternate in most where that was not an option i made some modifications to the ef i implemented the relationship that relied on the at which time ef to get around that i had to delete the foreign key property on the many side of the relationship at which point ef accepts the to sql and relationship

recently started to to learn irricht 3d i already went through all the tutorials and feeling ready to build a simple game upon so here is some have irricht a 3d engine that is based upon the scene graph model it knows how to load meshes textures and show them it provides me structured classes to handle input from the user it provide me easy way to build a it provide me easy ways to define camers lights fogs etc and provide me more convenient ways to do more naturally what the engine provide is a way to define the entities in the game and the relations between example if a ball hit the wall i want the wall to be broken into several ok this is my job to lay down an infrastructure that will represent the game so lets say i already did it and i have some data model that abstract objects and how they relate to each other am talking about logic relations and not spatial that handle all the logic and represents all entities in the here is my is the best way to connect my data model to the this is not a techincal question but rather a design points to keep in data model built upon it aware of is accessible through something in the data i want to build scene graph again but the appropriate data model is mainly a of of entities that with each other in am thinking about the mvc pattern but i would like to hear more opinions from anyone who has some experience with making is the best way to build a game upon an exisiting

recommend looking at this from a purely usability how are your users supposed to work while filling in most of the doing validation on both the control and the form level is what of there are many user interaction styles you can the users do what they and then check on their results on this can be excellent for expert allowing them to input things quickly and but leaves newbies and infrequent users rather at a each control as entered or on this can be especially for complex forms of course we but done poorly can prevent people from filling in forms incrementally in their own i prefer a visual indication that amiss if i do it impossible to enter anything this can be achieved through sliders for combo boxes for restricted edit boxes which prevent bad even in case there are some cases where you have to check whether combinations of values are worked with some cases where the values in some subsets of controls are dependent on each other by an not always feasible or worth the effort to provide the user with immediate feedback in these so a case can always be made for validating on agree with binary worrier that the ok check is the main if sure it should never be sure to log a warning if it and sniff such events through your support channels if but make the end user pay for programming

see the look at that top line in its script an html parser comes along and sees the opening inside normal parsing is disabled sgml the element has cdata to find where the script block the html parser looks for the matching first one it finds is the one inside the string an html parser know that inside a string because html parsers know anything about javascript they only know about so what you are actually saying an unclosed string literal and an unfinished function these result in javascript errors and the desired script tag is never common attempt to solve the problem is still technically wrong this is because in the character sequence that ends a cdata element is not actually but just sequence that is still present in the line browsers generally are more forgiving and in practice will allow the best solution is to escape the there are a few but the simplest is to use javascript string literal escapes above escapes all and which not only stops the sequence appearing in the but also allows it to be inserted into an xhtml script block without causing no such thing as a cdata so these characters would have the same meaning as if included in normal and a string inside a script block would actually create a nested script possible to allow in an xhtml script block by using a but a bit ugly and usually better to avoid using those characters in inline

seen several here about the best way to handle and persist values data suited for to persist an enum using and like to ask what the general consenus tried to summarize my marking this community wiki in the hope of getting a sort of expert consensus so here it the the enums should be handled using either the native enum type least in java and or using something like the enum using plain constants or is as you lose type safety make it hard to understand which values are legal input for a choice between these two depends on how much additional functionality is to be attached to the you want to put loads of functionality into the enum is because you avoid on it all the a class is usually more the other for simple the enum is usually at least in java an enum cannot inherit from another so if you have several enums with similar behavior which like to put into a you cannot use persist each enum value should be assigned a unique this can be either an or a short a short string is since it can be mnemonic it easier for dbas to understand the raw data in the the every enum should then have mapping functions to convert between the enum use inside the and the id value some frameworks have limited suppport for doing this you have to put it into the enum database should contain a table for each enum listing the legal one column would be the which is the additional columns might make sense for a all table columns that will contain values from that enum can then use this as a this guarantees that incorrect enum values can never be and allows the db to on its problem with this approach is that the list of legal enum values exists in two places and this is hard to avoid and therefore often considered but there are two keep the list of values in the generate the enum type at build but means that a db connection is required for a build to which seems the list of values in the code to be check against the values in the db at runtime at on practices for using and persisting

should work on the code snippet a little is creating a pointer of type class2 that is being passed to copyto tries to call a member function of the received pointer that has never been segmentation fault and the program if that did not kill the you are trying to from to which is just about doing if what you intend is casting the returned value from you must know that you cannot use on you must either change copyto signature to return class1 that you can later cast or use on the that either copy is a virtual function in class1 that is in fact executed in class2 and does create a class2 or the returned element will not be a but rather a name of the method copyto is confusing as it is not copying the argument but rather from the after all i still not know what you are asking where would you want to use stack you can pass an stack allocated element to a but returning a to an stack allocated element is again a segmentation the object will be destroyed when the function ends and the receiver will be left with a dangling if your question is more theoretical on whether you can use on a stack allocated you can that class2 inherits from class2 class1 c1 is a class1 reference to a class2 you update the post a comment in this answer so that i notice and can correct it

so much an answer as a clarification of the i think your factory is complicating things somewhat that you get a stack overflow exception versus not being able to compile at problem is a circular you cannot instantiate a without an instance of and you cannot instantiate an instance of b without an instance of class company private iclient ok so first build a client and pass it public class client private icompany ok so first build a company and pass it i public has an article about this which may be of some your class design is the problem and it needs the factory is just confusing the issue	
solution depends on the gameplay going if the gameplay is the anim is driven by the if the anim length determines how long the in that latter is typically more flexible in a commercial production environment as the designer can just say need that death anim to be and it gets but when you have very precise rules in mind or a simulated system like animation may be there is no orthogonal and clean solution for the general thing that helps to keep it from getting messy is to consider game ai ai is typically implemented as some form of finite state possibly multiple state machines or layered in some most common division being a high level scripting format with low level the low level you can say things like the hitreact playback my hitreact anim until it then find out from the logic what state to continue at the high level there are a multitude of ways to go about defining the but simple repeating loops like are a good way to helps to keep the two kinds of behaviors the planned and the reactions to new events from being too it always work out that way in for the same reasons that sometimes you want code to drive data or the other way but ai for no general solutions

solved a very similar problem by using the drawinggroup and adding or removing drawing objects from the drawinggroup as they either needed to be displayed or the key is to organize your drawing objects in such a way that they are easy to manage and to understand how to add and remove them from the remember that you want to add and remove the drawing objexts from the so use and you will need to keep an external list of the drawing objects you to the drawinggroup to do this and used this technique to great effect by drawing an image into the first child in my instance of drawinggroup and then adding and removing drawing objects to this instance of drawinggroup in order to layer etc on top of the or on the image by adding or removing drawing objects to the instance of the the drawinggroup is treated as a single drawing and so any or other manipulations will affect all drawing objects within the

surprised that while people mentioned the logical array approach of indexing an nobody mentioned the find if x is an nxmxo works by generating an nxmxo logical array and using it to index x can be bad if you have large arrays and are looking for a small works by generating list of indices of x that satisfy and indexing x by should be used more than it in my what i would call can to arrays and cell arrays if you know the size by using end 1 with higher dimensions so long as the dimensions of the slice match so have to initialize x to something other than in that not good for numerics but for small dynamic lists of things cell parsing 1 2 1 2 3 think many people know is that for works on any dim 1 so to continue the for n means if all you need is the members of x you need to index also works with cell arrays but a bit annoying because as it walks them the element is still wrapped in a for el to get at the elements you have to subscript for el remember if there is a nicer way around

tend to think that keeping with the latest version is a good that mean upgrading as soon as the product is released but within a relatively short timeframe afterwards can be for application java found that vendors generally provide a reasonably straightforward upgrade path from version to version and upgrading becomes more problematic if the upgrade must skip a few versions framework an application is working well in production without any problems i can understand the desire not to change anything and avoid the overhead of regression with more widespread adoption of automated unit if a new version offers significant benefits in terms of performance features is it worth found in my experience that products are not usually kept and when the particular version of the product is no longer supported the task of upgrading to the latest version tends to be quite time consuming and question it a good idea to keep with the latest version of major system components such as operating application we have oracle application server which is certified to use up to java sdk the latest version of java is now is currently in the and oracle application server is up to is certified for sdk upgrading to sdk it opens up the possibility for new applications being developed to use existing infrastructure to use more current versions of supporting frameworks such as hibernate or ibatis as well as later standards for these upgrades are not done the new application being developed is limited to using old versions and consequently will add to the time and cost of future upgrade or not to

think meant that you should strip processing the so that you can write the xslt as you would for a normalized what assumes that the multiple body tags have no content between this would not remove the content of the body note that be removing anything from a body tag to an this would leave in place the initial and final in other words with input like good more good be targeting those two tags in the removing these would yield a continuous good more good

think only we programmers have the habit of typing even before the page gets loaded of the friends i have wait till they see the signal from the loading the 2 issues above are les annoying than having to move our mouse tab everytime to type in what we want in sites which do not have focus on a particular websites browsers be programmed so that focus change if the user is already interacting with the site or the think browsers should be enabled to do this than the becauase it will be another trip back to server and can be frustrating for connections with low i think this is just another minor which we can live as i said only we programmers jump in type even before the page most of my friends dont know that they can type before the page gets loaded	
think part of the idea of oo programming is that classes and logic is separated so it would probably be better to split each class up into a separate as for when to create a new method in a class or a new i think if the method you use has to do with the main operations of that specific class it should be only make a new class when it performs routine or important and keep the right logic in the right

think that its really part of fusebox job to define access to code setting xfas each time is not really flexible style am typically use security tokens to restrict each fuseaction name is token by other custom tokens can be added by in your case custom tokens whould be and am using groups based so fuseaction permissions look like this is default security mapping for the fuseaction say i keep access map in so fuseaction and custom tokens being pushed into map when used first time and can be changed check access used simple method which compares current user groups your case with token way is a bit more flexible and gives you ability to define default access levels for different token to switch between strict if and loose if modes this

think you are misunderstanding idea behind using unions is toe save one and get result equivalent to not they looks similar in source but it is a completely different like apples and are a very low level construct that allows you to see a piece of memory as if storing any of its but you only can use at a even the use of the word is extremely they should be called or not you int double char are a piece of memory big enough for the biggest among an a char and a and lets call it that now you can store an a a if you store an and then store a the int is gone the point are two major uses for discriminated what we did i pick a piece of memory and i give it different meanings depending on sometimes the context is explicit keep some variable that indicates what of variable you and sometimes it can be implicit of the section of you can tell which one must be in either the code needs to be able to figure it or you be able to do anything sensible with the typical example would int typeindicator an a a abcunion are unions not unlike the above more split is sometimes useful when you need to be able to see a variable as either a or as a combination of easier to explain with an unsigned char unsigned char short a short int with a pair of you can view the same value as either a short int or you can just as easily study the individual bytes that make part of the value and that this second use is not portable pretty meaning that not guaranteed to work across different machine but this use is absolutely essential for the kind of tasks for which c was designed

this is much closer to dynamic dispatch than dynamic dynamic binding refers to the way in which a method is bound at there is no name if the methods are virtual then this is the definition of dynamic the name is known at compile time but the method called cannot be determined without knowing the runtime object not sure what you mean dynamic binding is the more idiomatic	
this is not an answer to the compilation errors you are but rather a broader view of the persistence problem you are and deserialization is not the simplest problem you can work my advice would be investing in learning libraries and using they have already worked out many of the problems you will face at one time or plus they already have different output formats first thing you must that is if you decide to go ahead and implement your is what will be the file format and whether it suits all your will it always be used in the same will the platform change you can decide to make it binary as it is the or make it readable for a human if you decide on json or any other more complex just forget it and use a simplest solution is working on a binary file and it is also the solution that will give you a smallest on the other it is quite sensible to architecture changes you migrate from a 32 to a 64 bit deciding the format you will need to work on the extra information that is not part of your objects now but needs to be inserted into the file for later then start working from the smallest parts to more complex advice would be to start working with the simplest most defined part and build from there start avoiding templates as much as and once you have it clear and working for a given data work on how to generalize it for any other i have written the code directly on the so there could be some typos or just about anything first simple approach is just writting a textual representation of the the advantage is that it is portable and shorter in code not than the binary the resulting files will be bigger but user this point you need to know how reading text works with whenever you try to read a string the system will read characters until it reaches a this means that the following only read up to the first tab or end of when reading numbers as an the system will read all valid digits up to the first that input 12345a will consume all characters up to you need to know this because that will influence the way you persist data for later is a long will read but ignore the a b a will produce will read not you pretty much need separators to insert in the output and to parse the for sample purposes i will select the it must be a character that does not appear in the text will also be a good idea to not only separate elements but also add some extra info of the for the elements in the vector you can decide to use a different if you want to be able to read the file manually you can use so that each item is in its own textual inventoryitem const data return o const v o for int i i o will call the above defined you will need to split the input by to get each element and then with to parse the textual template void const t data str create a stream with the st use inventoryitem data quantity in wholesalecost in wholesalecost return data int tmp size without last parameter getline splits by size obtain size as for int i i inventoryitem tmp read an inventory data return the vector reading function i have used getline parse to read the that is to guarantee that the next will actually read the first inventoryitem and not the trailing after the most important piece of code there is the template that is able to convert from a string to any type that has the insertion operator it can be used to read primitive library types for and user types that have the operator we use it to simplify the rest of the code quite a a binary this will be a pain in the ass if you the simplest way i can think of is writing the number of elemements in the vector as a the size is in your followed by all the each element will printout the binary representation of each of its for basic types as it will just output the binary format of the for strings we will resort to writting a number with the number of characters in the string followed by the contents of the void const str int size write the size write the template void t data will work only with pod data and not data void inventoryitem const data void const v int size size could use the size for int i i i have selected a different name for the template that writes basic types than the functions that write strings or the reason is that we want to later on by mistake use the template to write a complex type userinfo containing that will store an erroneous representation in from disk should be fairly binary template void void str int size buffer new create a temporary buffer and read into size str delete void inventoryitem data void inventoryitem v clear the vector in case it is not int size for int i i inventoryitem item item using this the and must be opened in binary v work on v error checking is left as an exercise for the reader you have any question on any part of the just

this sort of thing pretty much always done a this function looks at the state of the and trying to spread this code out always leads to a problem really just sets a property and then calls seen a few attempts to handle this in a generic but none that i really liked example the wtl generally these are not badly but just easy to quickly exceed what they can and generally the state logic is important enough that having it explicitly coded with simple style logic leads to less confusion

though clojure was developed with java developers it was not written java is designed to interoperate well in the java it this is not it was designed for least not in language part of the and implies that the language and jvm are interconnected in some way that makes them they are conjure is a native jvm language jython or and it uses a very virtual machine to live greg said clojure is built to be with and unless you want to really get into software transactional memory say to check out a different clojure was not to be with it was built for the you can use java libraries if you but it required it is and as far as the advice to use a different lisp if you want to learn clojure meant to be it is meant to be a and by the that means to enhance lisp in certain to make it more modern and ability to work well with java should be considered a not a greg above points languages like clojure and groovy target the jvm for one main so that java developers can have the best of both for reasons stated they were not written for java sorry to be so blunt but i seen one educated post on clojure in these i just learned about clojure it is just frustrating to see this kind of harmful advice so easily will just end with a quote by rick hickey guy who wrote can hate java and like the goes on to say that that is where he

try to explain the problem as best as i can since it is a bit strange for have a class library that defines a bunch of classes that will used as data transfer objects or a windows forms application that has a reference to this dtos class library and also a reference to another class library which defines the presenters for the model view presenter presenter class library has a reference to another class library which contains wcf proxy wcf proxys class library has a reference to another class library with all the interfaces that define the contracts for the wcf this library with the wcf contracts has a reference to the first dtos class library since they are received as parameters for the after explaining this infrastructure the problem is that the windows form project is not compiling the error getting does not implement interface member cannot implement it does not have the matching return type of the code looks like interface is defined on the presenters class interface iemployeeview jobdescriptions is the form in the windows forms partial class employeeview iemployeeview public jobdescriptions set do something i need i know all the class libraries separation may sound weird but because of the deployment i mention before that the presenter class library does not have a reference to the dto one and neither does the wcf services it seems it is being pulled from the service interfaces class library since if i manually add it to the presenter one i get a circular reference with multiple reference to a class

users now want to put strings the value field as well from a list and wondering what the best way of that would sounds like the users want to add new if that is the case why not just add them to your existing testcode table and keep your existing it be bad practice to the field over to a string and store both strings and integers the same there are issues related to this one but sure if any are a really big not a big often po numbers or invoice numbers have numbers or a combination of letters and you are right however about the performance of the database on a number field as opposed to a but if you index the string field you end up with the database doing scans on numeric indexes problems you may have had with your decimals as strings probably have to do with the floating point data types in which the server essentially estimates the value of the field and only retains accuracy to a certain number of this can lead to a whole host of rounding errors if you are concerned about the you can avoid that issue by using currency fields or the like that have static accuracy of the lol i learned this the hard did a great job addressing everything

using it is generally a bad idea to use an external without a revision it means that it becomes hard to correlate the version of the external with the version of the containing i know this the hard from trying to track down some history in a project that contained and i would have to guess which revision corresponded to the revision in the containing project it was earlier because someone had updated the external project and then updated the containing sometimes it was later because someone had edited files directly in the external checkout and then committed as suggested by the tip box a couple paragraphs into the section in the subversion you should always commit externals with a revision that whenever you check out a particular revision of the containing the appropriate revision of the external will also be checked it does mean a little more as you have to update the revision number in the property every time wrote a script to do it but in the long run it is a much better here is the skeleton of the script we used rake for conveniently updating the external and keeping everything in external for this project do rev rev or raise svn revision update the sh url sh propset update again to put the externals back to the right sh

using you can instantiate datatable rather than the whole in if the datatable is it comes with dataset by 2005 and you get just the at your data access layer for filling the datasets or most often the case that there is too much data coming make your queries more sure the code using does not do goofy things like copy the datasets when passed make sure using statements or dataviews to filter and rather than making a whole lot of quick for if having trouble with use items 2 and this would be the case regardless of what type of data transport object get good at if not familiar with you can do silly like with then write articles about how they which are really articles about how little you know about really quite useful and simple to a couple typed save you gobs of coding and which helps with simple using typed make sure you modify the generated code if using you can put any custom business object behavior in the partial class for the ds the code dataview and wherever you find yourself looping through datarow around for a good code generation tool and build a rational data access framework for filling and updating from the one of the issues is that designers tie the design of the ds directly to tables in the making the design brittle to data structure if you do build or use a code generator to build your data access layer from the like start by looking at some of the codesmith templates for generating stored procs and data access when talking to someone about the object in this case is the not the and because of the partial classes you can put behavior on the getting you of the benefits of for those who love writing a a

valgrind states that a value is not then in it is really not when compiler reports use of an uninitialised value in you check for inline as your uninitialised value can be declared not for example 10 levels of inline function template than actual gcc does the but in so you should check whole path in which uninitialised value travelled from place of being declared not to the place where actually the path can be for cascade of function where each function passes its arguments possibly uninitialised to next will report in last when the value is actually you should not ignore what valgrind valgrind is not a simple trace can be seen as a virtual is in essence a machine using compilation dynamic nothing the original program ever gets directly on the host valgrind first translates program into a simpler called intermediate which is a after the a tool is free to whatever transformations it would on the before valgrind the ir back into machine code and the host processor run even it could use dynamic translation the host and target processors from different valgrind recompiles code to run on host and target cpus of the

was i have used cmake and successfully compiled the resulting visual studio i found the cmake documentation very unhelpful i had to ask an existing user and the official manual costs was out of print at the the visual studio project it produced was very rigidly formatted according the template preferred by whoever wrote the i was unable to figure out how to customize project options or group source regularly on visual studio and for the most you just need to add all of the source files and header files into a visual studio project existing and add your entire source and then compile usually get so you start fixing bugs from if you used you may be stuck porting to an alternative or removing further word of visual studio and have different compiler for the most they both conform excellently to the but slightly code which works in one may not work in the i have found this to be particularly true when dealing with with visual studio being bizarrely permissive of syntax errors in many

was originally a question i wanted to but while researching the details for the question i found the solution and thought it may be of interest to the full request is in double quotes and any quotes inside are always escaped with a 400 299 trying to construct a regex which matches all distinct my current solution always stops on the first quote after the i only need all the values including the size guess also provide my solution from my php source with comments and better ip ident and user 2 ss request 8 status 9 bytes end of this with a simple case where the url contain other quotes works 400 299 trying to get support for one or more occurrences of into but find a using came up with this so only the changed request too it eats everything until the last when it should only eat until the first not preceded by a i also tried introducing the requirement that no before the i but it still eats to the end of the string i had to add extraneous characters to make this work in request then it hit if used immediately after any of the quantifiers or makes the quantifier the minimum number of request full 5th may discovered a small flaw in the regexp due parsing millions of it breaks on lines which contain the backslash character right before the double in other break the apache will not log but will always escape the backslash to so safe to assume that when two backslash characters before the double has an idea how to fix this with the the javascript regexp documentation at and expression that matches between containing escaped

way i handle it is to have an installed into program files next to the main on app i have the app download an xml file off of the web and save it in the app data this file contains the latest versions of the dlls and has a simple version through the list of filenames and if you have the dll locally or you have an older then add the needed dll to an update you generate your update fire off the with a command line list of the files to be you have to write them to program files but i on my updater pops up the uac prompt correctly it should to maintain program updater then downloads the files to program files and restarts the main problem with firing off the second app is that you have to give it a manifest with set in hard to but once the updater is done and retriggers the main it cannot start the main app with normal an exe running as administrator can only start other as administrator even if is set in the i know why you restrict it back to normal can only elevate permissions for some

working on a tool that parses files for css style it uses a very complicated regular expression besides the expected performance issues and a few minor bugs that affecting me for is doing everything like it to do except for one have it matching all combinations of element when a line contains more than one i can only get it to match as an here is the kind of thing that is tripping me up at the can write an expression that will satisfy this for all of the three but since i am also capturing information after it actual style info within the i feel like this entire block of text is considered to be accounted for so the engine moves on to the next character following the whole block that just got there a way to accomplish this where each class will be a separate match and all will include the style info that follows as i know that i can modify my regex to match the whole line and then parse it for commas after i get my but like to keep all my logic inside the expression itself if can post the expression the commented code i use to generate it if absolutely relevant to the but the expression is all regexes and the code is a bit regex with overlapping	
working on an application with a map and there is a div in the corner with some stuff in you can click on this map to bring up some information in a little the window in some being covered by the div in the want the opposite effect covers i figured this would simply be a issue but unable to get it to this is with ie7 and from reading up a bit it seems like work unless inside of an element that is elements seem to be positioned properly to get the to work right but having little played around with adding styling via firebug but had any luck in getting anything to the window really is just two divs one absolutely positioned one and a relative one inside of the the only thing that could be the problem here or is there something else i know there any other methods to achieve the effect i i cannot simply hide the div via jquery or something because part of it should be visible from behind the window that opens on the the only way to force an element to be positioned over top of if not what other methods are

would normally have two problems with putting a problem aside for a my boss probably go for it because the business will usually need a solution sooner as opposed to and i have the attention span of a gold so if i drop a problem for that i will have to take time to walk through the problem because filled my brain with dozens of other problems in the not entirely because sometimes i do find a more elegant solution when forced to refresh myself on the code and the business constraints that define the but sometimes i just spend half a day running myself into the same that being the idea of putting a problem aside is a good but the time frame often realized a solution while eating breakfast the morning following an end of the day brain lock up to articulate the problem to colleagues often just because the effort will expose gaps in your understanding of the usually the other person find a better solution unless actually working with you on the problem from the just because they understand all the constraints that probably spent days mapping out in your answer the original my preferred method after taking a break and running it by some is to implement the adequate solution and just get something reason is that if the client decides that what they because they never really know what they want in the first you have spent too much time on something be thrown out another reason is that the adequate solution might just be you can move the best reason is that an implementation gets you into the hard questions and from there you might start to see a better like building models as an you can do lots of and even spend a lot of time on nice but really more effective to quickly get a glue gun and starting throwing cardboard models once you can see it in 3d you can start to see where things line up and you wasted your time on nice renderings that will gloss over the

would say that choosing between sockets and remoting you better consider on what type of application you are sockets are definitely for your own protocol low level programming and the only way to go if you have to communicate to the other remoting is a preffered way to develop new communication where you need to come down to stack and ensure your application talks to the others legacy in case you could go only with better to choose and wcf framework instead of the last one is dead and unsupported

you followed all the instructions on it seems to cover more registry settings than what you as you point looks like that page is for annoying how msft culls legacy information and makes it downright hard to thing to check is the event logs maybe they contain a it may be possible to crank up the auditing level to see more have your code so i debug it but i was able to hook a debugger into and get control at the point it launches the utilities on the secure maybe if you do this you can figure out the security the target the debugging tools for rdp the to bring up the utility manager and leave it sure your symbols and source are visible on the target at the same path that they were compiled on the dev another into the target computer as a user with the rdp windbg and attach to the utilman process it break into the press to ensure your utility gets loaded into this debugger instance when it to continue on the target computer console your utility from the utility the debugger the rdp should break inside the new process and you should be able to debug from have visual studio on the machine where i tried this if you have vstudio on the target machine you can probably use it instead of your utility even then windows is doing some kind of validation prior to the call to the security logs might be able to help you i tried using the utility to locate the program that generates the dialog but on an english winxp so i have the actual i also looked for hardcoded with no you can figure out what exe is putting up that dialog perhaps you should be able to attach to it with the debugger and walk back up the stack to find the check that errors once you have the general vicinity of the check that you should be able to set a breakpoint earlier in the codepath that should break into the debugger the next time you try to you should be able to step through the failing check from for all of make sure you have the since it should make the much easier to not familiar with whether your debugger has support for the symbol

your specific requirements are core to your ie part of your business is to provide a smooth and and you feel that none of the available deployment libraries can let you achieve then certainly go ahead and build your your specific requirements would be nice to have but they do not make a significant part of your ie the end user will not typically be expecting or needing a smooth installation or will never need to do that themselves they pass that step onto their it then the need to build your own just for your own specific requirements is likely to be outweighed by the extra effort that would think that your impression that you will be needing a custom solution is a sound it seems like your requirements are going to be key to the experience of your especially if you need really smooth automatic updates and

your usercontrol appears on every then one way to address this would be to use a base controller from which all of your controllers derive and generate the viewdata for the usercontrol by overriding the onactionexecuting method and putting the logic if your usercontrol is less but still frequently used throughout the you could extend actionfilterattribute and have your filter generate the needed this attribute could be used to decorate the controllers or actions that generate views that use the assuming in all of this that the data for the usercontrol is independent of the action being if there is a probably best to push the logic into a class perhaps using and make the generation of the data explicit in each action or controller overriding
