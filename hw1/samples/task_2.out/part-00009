1 the in the prototype applies to the that dict int as function with a argument of type pointer to constant dict which means you can change the but not you want to get the effect you probably declare it like const int rule the applies to the word that is to the left of except when it is first in the type and then it applies to the next changing change the pointer in the main since the pointer is passed by assigning to the the compiler checks that the types are in this means that you can only add not remove as you should you use the you should use const on all you as you probably want to change the dictionary the i use any since the data are to be changed a good signature for it would int you would be able to change the calling pointer to delete the first

a base controller and have your controllers derive from set your start time in the constructor and override and put the calculation of the total time this should give you an on the entire life of the since controller implements assuming that the render engine will dispose it after the result is computed and you have to wait for garbage if my assumption turns out to be you could use to get the rendering time on the page would be relatively hard because by definition the page be done rendering until your time is put on the page and you have the time until the page is done you write the render time to the session then use ajax to come back and get the render time for display you might be able to approximate it by putting the start time in viewdata and calculating the rendering time in the view you might want to try logging the render time and doing the view approximation and see how close it code could be used to log the render class basecontroller private datetime starttime public starttime public override void bool disposing var totaltime write it out somewhere

a long one so you might want to get that cup of been holding off on run a game called world of a turn based strategy game akin to risk or each player has a set of armies and the question revolves around the display of these currently the map is created using a background image with css positioning of team icons on top of that to represent you can see how it looks background image for the map is located and created in not designed to draw maps but hopelessly incompetent with photoshop and this works for my purposes just problem comes that i want to perform such fun things as pathfinding and for that i need to have the map somehow stored in i have tried using i have looked at incorporating it with i tried going and creating tiles as from many older games and finally i tried to use i say this so you can see clearly that not through lack of trying that i have this problem want to be able to store the map layout in code and both create an image from it and use it for things such as using python but i suspect that most answers will be the cities other such things are stored already and easily drawn i want to store the layout of the landmass and features on the for each type of terrain has a movement cost and when the map is stored as just an image i access the terrain of a given in addition to pathfinding i wish to be able to know the terrain for various things related to the cities in mountains produce stone for there a good way to do this and what terms should i have used in google because the terms i tried all came up with unrelated stuff being something completely different most of the can be placed anywhere on the map as can anywhere but in the water where drown and probably complain that chatting to somebody on msn who made me go over the really minute details and who has a better understanding of the game to the fact that played occurring to me that tiles are the way to go but not the way i had initially i put the bitmap down as it is now but also have a data layer of each tile has a given terrain type and thus pathfinding and suchlike can be done on it yet at the same time i still render using omnigraffle which works pretty will be making an editor for this as suggested by i know that graphs will be relevant but not had a chance to look into them fully really appreciate all those that answered my map from

am developing a restful web have a bunch of entity classes jpa but also other are gazillions of object binding and whatnot libraries out looking for a one that will enable me the entities to xml and must support using not only object must support by views i mean a way to specify a subset of the properties of the which are to be for an see partial in the social platform i also want it to recurse indefinitely view should define properties to be exposed in the entity and a view for each of them entities the entity might have views and when requesting a view of a only properties and would be when requesting a the properties and are would also be but only with the view it recurse to json serialization must be what would make sense in that means i want proper booleans and nulls and i want extra object wrappers or something that tries to capture the entire xml it must be possible to configure the serialization to use for serializing not xml arrays must be serialized using nested elements so possible to differentiate between empty arrays and properties which present in a given property present in person has no xml and json and merge the data into existing this is the difficult the next two are of must be possible to but which properties are present is not defined in into existing not creating new is a bit tricky to most libraries deserialize into java but at that the distinction between an undefined property and a property it exists in xml as described is being given this being passed a the library touch the entities clear for course with lists this should be more i would expect to configure an id by which it would decide whether to update the nested entity or create a new are a reason why the library must not just return a because at that time a might either mean or been saying a i realize now the library actually provide but there must be a way to add the functionality in a clean fashion not in a way that would make rewriting everything bean serialization and

am working on an application which accepts any uploaded csv stores it alongside other datasets which have been uploaded and then produces output or based on the user selecting which they want the database will be automatically expanded to handle columns and datatypes as this is in preference to a uploading these 2 sets to a blank dept age sales it dept age sales 24 it 32 programatically change the table so that importing dataset a results in 3 newly created columns importing dataset b results in 1 newly created column at the forget about whether the recordsets should be combined or not and that no issue i have is that some columns will also have lookup values say that the dept column will at some point in the future have associated values which give the address and phone numbers of that the same could be true for the salary looking up tax groupings number of columns in this big table should not become too high few but will be high enough to want the user to administer the lookup table structure and values through an admin panel rather than have to involve developers each is whether to use individual lookup tables for each column or a combined lookup table which references the column normally i would opt for individual lookup but here the application will need to create them automatically and then add a new join into the master sql this would be done at the request of the user rather than when the added avoid hundreds of empty combined lookup table on the other hand would need to be joined multiple times onto the data selecting on the column name each lookups seems to make sense to me but i may be barking up completely the wrong creation of new lookup tables based on values in main data

an arbitrary real either an integral type or a floating point type is only going to provide an the integral approximation will never be off by more than in one direction or the other that the real number fits within the range of that integral the floating point approximation will never be off by more than a small percentage assuming that the real is within the range of values supported by that floating point this means that for smaller floating point types will provide closer approximations storing an approximation to pi in a float is going to be much more accurate than the int approximation for very large the integral approximation will actually be better than the floating point consider the value which is only off by when represented as 9223372036854775807 as a but which is represented by when stored as a is just an artifact of how printing the values and cannot be exactly represented as floating point values the denominator a power of just as be exactly written as a decimal get where the repeat regardless of the language you the internal representation of this value is going to be the but different ways of printing the value may display it note that if you evaluate in the result is displayed as least on my type you use in scientific calculations will depend on exactly what trying to your answer is generally only going to be approximately how accurate do you need it to what are your performance i believe that the decimal type is actually a fixed point which may make it inappropriate for calculations involving very small or very large note also that includes arbitrary precision rational numbers the bignum which may also be appropriate depending on your	
an example that dates back to my own university days it was used both as a database design challenge and as an object oriented design all information was revealed at once part of the challenge was to see how to adapt a design to handle new and how proper normalisation made this you have to design a database for a situation and want to handle have the each course has a title and a regular timeslot each course has a who presents the course has many who study the course has one or more who help students with their you need to track which tutors help which courses have multiple regular courses have multiple and tutors are which means we need to track some information for tax the tax department care what they were paid for they expect us to have a single record per some the lecturer works as a tutor as to get a close up view of how some students are handling the tutors are also on other be a tutor on a you have to have been a student on that course at an earlier every student will receive credit for passing the course some are just auditing the course without a need for student who fails a course may attend the course again later we need to keep records of every

and both frameworks have complementary but different ccr offers primitives for coordination of concurrent coordination is the glue that makes a bunch of processes work as a whole so the ccr offers primitives for exchanging messages through so called processes can wait for a message to arrive on a or a number of or any one of a number of channels and so this is a particular paradigm for coordination of concurrent processes that works note also that is it not free you have to buy if from microsoft tpl offers primitives and infrastructure to computations or algorithms one of the most obvious primitives there is the parallel for loop looks sort of like a for loop but tries to execute the loop in if you have a bunch of process that like to coordinate on a higher level than using shared state and use the if you have a process that like to run efficiently on a use the

answer depends on where the javascript being asking about javascript running in a browser directly accessing a database on a remote server then the answer is the best you can do is create a web service which updates the database and call that via an object from you you would need to be very careful about what you offered via such a web if you allowed any sql statements anybody could connect to your service and run from or insert new user records or do anything running javascript through the windows scripting host via or similar you can create odbc objects and access the database that running javascript on a jvm i think you can use you want to give more details i can be more	
answer to this question is one of process and toolchain need to decide how you wish to access known versions on how you want to make changes to those and how you want to disseminate changes to other vcs systems that are will support common here is one that is is on the time for a tag the a branch off of the trunk at the tag you the code based on the development of new features on the you need to fix a bug in check out the branch and fix release that as creating a new tag changes from your branch back to the trunk as steps 6 7 as needed until your next is another common is on the time for a tag the to production based on the a bug is create a branch to fix that bug against the on the new and that branch back to steps 6 whenever you find a are very common and simple to they are easily supported by most version control if you get more complex you will reduce the toolset but possibly have more

application such as this would require a fairly complex data model to account for the different kinds of schools would have different a university might let you add or drop but an elementary school typically does a university needs to schedule courses into whereas an elementary school needs to put students into grades and split grades into classrooms based on available space and design needs to take into consideration all of the requirements it is expected to solve and then implement the more generic you make the program the harder it is to satisfy your the question says the code if you want to write a single program that solves every it will need hundreds of in some cases some schools will require an opposite feature from another for example some schools will need to enforce one teacher per subject or classroom while another school might require multiple the more requirements you expect to the more complex the application industry big applications tend to be written so that they can be a core set of functionality is provided but the application is meant to be changed and customized for a particular this makes it easier to develop because you need to anticipate every in fact you need to anticipate many needs until you have a customer with those but with you are not writing code only most important step is to come up with a data model that is flexible enough to extend later but so flexible that it is impossible to develop the hardest part is usually getting the cardinality of relationships for you might say a class has one then when it turns out a class needs two you have to rewrite a lot of code and fix up a lot of these kinds of changes are annoying and in the end you can always fix mistakes given enough programmer

as a to this popular i no longer use guids myself in this like the other popular i now use my own hashing algorythim to generate the key to send in the this has the advantage of being shorter as look into to generate which i usually use a salt as do not immediately reset the do not immediately reset the password when they request this is a security breach as someone could guess email addresses your email address at the and reset passwords at best practices these days usually include a link sent to the email confirming they want to reset this link is where you want to send the unique key i send mine with a link set a timeout on the link and store the key and timeout on your backend salt if you are using timeouts of 3 days is the and make sure to notify the user of 3 days at the web level when they request to a unique hash previous answer said to use a now editing this to advise everyone to use a randomly generated using the make sure to eleminate any from the i recall a special 6am phone call of where a woman received a certain word in her to be hashed key that a developer clicks is asked for an enters email and clicks do not confirm or deny the email as this is bad practice as simply have sent a password reset request if the email is or something cryptik create a hash from the store it as a seperate entity in an table and link back to the so this so you can track old requests and inform the user that older links has the link to the gets the like and clicks the link is you ask for a new and the user gets to set their own set your own cyptik password here and inform them of their new password here email it to

asked this question a relatively long time ago couple months then when i get a response that worked for me i went back to sending multiple data tables and them on the application side the way it needed to be i found an answer to this question and had to share it with the community support for xml since version 9 is absolutely incredible and in particular the package can be used to solve the problem i listed above by parsing and sending the select statements back as an xml dataset that can be easily converted on the application side by here is the example code from a test stored proc i recently from orders where companyid from where like will return something like the following pull orderrecords in as a string and covert to companyname orderrecords shawns company xml string listed version additional fields cut out not necessary for example note additional fields cut out not necessary for example additional fields cut out not necessary for example additional rows cut out not necessary for example is a lot more to the package besides this one very cool it is definitely worth checking

best not to put a relative path into if the current directory changes during execution if you are running from a different directory to the script it if you want to make it relative to the use the character should be escaped to for and really it ought to be using instead of relying on windows path if another imported script has played with it have pulled the wrong path also reloads of your own modules will best leave the path where it name parts your path includes the segment so effectively trying since is already in the path you added to search what you really want is name is a so it should be if you really want to have it write to your local almost certainly want leave the fromlist that module is a module object and wants a module you already have the module why not just reaction to all this is much this overly difficult for yourself and creating a lot of potential problems and fragility by messing around with the internals of the import this is tricky stuff even for experienced python would almost certainly be better off using plain old python modules which you import the list of commands is really no great having all your commands in a with repeat the filenames but is much simpler and more robust than a surfeit of

clean code is easier to bend to your it is possible to design an interface that is simple and mention of hop helps to highlight one of the easiest ways to give huge flexibility to your the ability to pass in a function reference whatever you call it in your language of perl sort function is a perfect example of this pass a code ref and a and get a sorted the code ref works with localized variables and if the code returns comes after return 0 to set an and to put before does the power of this approach come it works so well it encapsulates the the idea behind the visitor pattern is the java is such a verbose language that it costs more to implement and maintain than a bunch of else if else flexibility and simplicity are the result of a good possible to create inelegant crap in any language any design d

conforming to the protocol set your object as the you need to do that explicitly either in the nib or in as already only one object can be a delegate at one having multiple delegates may make sense in some for example if you have a table view that displays two sets of you could make two delegate and datasource objects for and switch between them as it probably make sense to do this for the delegate since the code there is pretty in mind that sometimes an object will send notifications in addition to calling delegate a lot of time it looks like the same since the object will automatically subscribe your delegate to the notification if it includes a certain method the key difference though is that other objects besides the delegate can also subscribe to these so you can hook them up to multiple objects at

error message maps to source code is available at for limitations on using an sqlite3 database handle from more than one you are allowed to reuse a database handle and statements across threads but one thread must be completely done accessing the database before the other thread starts overlapping access is not that sounds like happening for you and is consistent with the error you need to access the same database from more than one i recommend instead opening the database separately from each thread and setting a timeout using sqlite will then handle contention for blocking for a short time in one thread if the other thread is writing data while still allowing simultaneous

everyone else has said an interface is a classes implementing an interface promise to provide the methods but in my own studies i really wanted to know why that is why not just use inheritance have a lot of experience with oop but written my thoughts sure other more experienced oop programmers can add more to this correct me if made a languages that support multiple otherwise unrelated classes can share functionality by implementing the same find it easier to understand the difference by looking at inheritance and interfaces in terms of a class inheriting from a base class has an relationship with that whereas a class implementing an interface has an relationship with that borrow an example from 4th a car vehicle and a house yet both classes might implement the canbeboughtwithabigloan

experience is that in situations where you need a of the and types of fields are so flexible and likely to change throughout the lifetime of your project that you would likely need some sort of map instead of example have an attribute map from keys to public calls for getting and setting the but let everybody use them make sure they create classes to represent each attribute you are interested and that class provides all the functions for manipulating that for if you have you could have a class that is initialized to a specific player and then provides setters with appropriate validation and and perhaps things like calculating strength with advantage of this is that you decouple the use of your attributes from your player so if you now add an intelligence you have to deal and recompile everything that manipulates only for accessing fields a bad when you access a field in vb least in old you usually call a property getter and setter and vb simply hides the call for my view is that you have to adapt to the conventions of the language that you are in java and the like you have fields and you have calling a method should always have the to make it clear that it is a call and other things may happen you could get an either one of the benefits of java is its more precise syntax and to java or is like texting to graduate school scientific some usability research shows that better to not have parameters to constructors and rather construct and call all the setters if you need

filesystemwatcher is using some of the hooks to subscribe to changes and just gets the os to call your delegates when a change so all you have to do is stop your main thread from it have to actually do by the time you get to that the main part of your program is it has done what it needed to simple way of doing what you want is to make this change to the sample from will put your main thread to sleep but will still allow the delegates to fire and respond to changes in the note that it will keep running through multiple changes like the msdn that the in the msdn sample really do you could replace that line with just which would then make any key quit the just a line to stop the main thread from exiting so that it is still around when the event notifications come using the leaves your app in a state where it cannot be easily stopped by a other than by killing the if you are writing this as a console why not stick with the q to if you decide to write it as a service instead it will probably be as long as you handle the events

for know that a ref parameter in passes a to a allowing the external variable itself to be changed within a called but is the reference handled much like a c pointer the current contents of the original variable with every access to that parameter and changing the original variable with every modification to the or can the called method rely on a consistent reference for the duration of the the former brings up some thread safety in written a static method in which passes an object by static void definition caller provides a completed but and after some consistency checking we the definition they if there is already a definition with the same it register the new one and instead their reference is updated to the for that want this to be rigorously but a pathological scenario comes to suppose the client our shares the reference in an such as using a static member rather than a local static definition riskyreference one thread sets new fills out the and calls our while another thread also decides to set new are we guaranteed that in our register method the reference handling will not be modified on us by other threads the reference to the object was copied in and will be copied out when we or can that other thread replace the object on us in the middle of our execution referencing a pointer to the original storage and thus break our that this is different from changes to the underlying object which are of course possible for a reference type but can be easily guarded against by appropriate locking within that we guard changes to an external variable space we would have to make our own copy of the parameter at the top of the method and overwrite the parameter at the bottom but that would seem to make more sense for the compiler to do for us given the insanity of handling an unsafe tend to think that the reference may be copied in and copied out by the compiler so that the method is handling a consistent reference to the original object it changes its own reference when it wants regardless of what might be happening to the original location on other but having trouble finding a definitive answer on that point in documenation and discussion of ref anyone assuage my concern with a definitive for confirmed it with a code example and thinking about it it makes sense that it is indeed the behavior which i was worred one point of is to pass large structs by reference rather than copy another reason is that you might to set up a monitoring of a variable and need to pass a reference to it which will see changes to the variable changing between null and a live which an automatic would not allow to make our method robust against client we could implement it static void definition definition thedefinition copy sanity actual changing thedefinition to a new definition newdefinition copy still have their own threading issues as far as what they end up but at least their insanity break our own process and possibly slip a bad state past our ref parameters or vulnerable to unsafe multithreaded

going to build a book store in which we have 3 designed the database as the following both buyer and seller can one or more books a buyer needs a seller account if wants to sell a buyers will offer their price and seller would like to sell to best buyer and i have to save all information among this model the class will be the other three classes seller book buyer name sid was my first thought then i found out that this schema will fail in the process due to a buyer could buy multiple books at same time and there were other so i changed this model the class will be the other three classes book buyer name xxx sid indicates a primary key will work better i but how to get into work with i can add a offer to the so changed my mind this model came into the for long field will be added to the book buyer name xxx sid offer date indicates a primary key absolutely confused with the db design due to my first is this going to satisfy the system if how can i make it if is there any better suggestion is thanks in advance i really choose the best answer all many many many thanks hope you best store database

good i think i have seen them more often than not it is an effort to fix performance problems by someone that is too darn lazy to troubleshoot their way down to the cause of those performance problems or even researching whether there actually is a performance in many of these cases i wonder if it just a case of that person wanting to try a particular technology and desperately looking for a nail that fits their shiny new a recent architect comes to me with an elaborate proposal to vertically partition a key table in a fairly large and complex he wants to know what type of development effort would be necessary to adjust for the the conversation went like why are you considering what is the problem you are trying to table x is too we are partitioning it for performance what makes you think it is too the consultant said that is way too many columns to have in one and this is affecting users have reported intermittent slowdowns in the xyz module of the how do you know the width of the table is the source of the that is the key table used by the xyz and it is like 200 it must be the but module xyz in particular uses most of the columns in that and the columns it uses are unpredictable because the user configures the app to show the data they want to display from that it is likely that of the time wind up joining all the tables back together anyway which would the consultant said it is too wide and we need to change who is this i know we hired a nor did they talk to the development team at we hired them this is part of a proposal they but they insisted we needed to this uh so the consultant who sells database services thinks we need a database conversation went on and on like i took another look at the table in question and determined that it probably could be narrowed with some simple normalization with no need for exotic partitioning of course turned out to be a moot point once i investigated the performance problems and tracked them down to two indexes on a few few rogue data analysts who were key the querying database directly course the architect is still pushing for a vertical partitioning of the table hanging on to the he even bolstered his case by getting a proposal from another database consultant who was able to determine we needed major design changes to the database without looking at the app or running any performance

good rule of thumb would varargs for any method that needs an array of t type t may as will make calls to these methods easier need to do could extend this rule to include methods with a provided that this argument is for input only the list is not modified by the i would refrain from using because its slips towards a programming way with unclear terms of i have used it in where i can add several in one the code above the method is defined as the implementation of such methods must take care of the fact that it may be called with an empty if you want to impose at least one then you have to use an ugly trick such consider this trick ugly because the implementation of the method will be less straightforward than having just in its arguments this helps clarifying the point about	
good to be in good have a similar situation on my in my a task and trying to find the other people in my role in other whenever i meet the experience is and i learn a lot of good tips but i want that to happen more company also has so good to hear that other people have the same problem connecting with this tool that is theoretically about connecting and sharing trying a collection of things to see what so the person to person ennabled with email and our internal im system are the best connections but that involves a person to person stuff i had in via still a since anything public involves a certain amount of care and and the things i want to connect with others on do not lend themselves to the necessary level of corporate diplomacy needed to for a topic area our company has a see how well they it seems best when there is a group that is the who provides some basic level content for everyone else to feed off someone has to be bulletin we actually have mostly they have notices for one time but one thing we have are and sessions about specific technical a similar session for a roundtable on an issue or technical area might be valuable although it will only catch people in the local i started doing a lightwieght version i have lunch monthly with a friend who is a and we are inviting sooner or i hope be the software task manager suport and a natural place for like minded people to come hang social been prevailing upon the sharepoint portal people no to suggest that the difficulty with sharepoint is the lack of human social networks like and facebook all have the concept that you have through people form traversible webs based on interests and shared this is what i think sharepoint is most the really ambiguous need of finding people who know something about my current tasks and who might be able to help at least i think that last one is the big as we thrive on not just getting the info we but also being able to judge it against what we know about the source of a wiki is great for factual but the reason to interface with other humans to have that particular quality of interaction that is much messier than bare to get that in an online context you need connection to lightwieght topic and a chance to make some things access controlled so that people can speak their minds without corporate

got nothing in answers here focus on oop but encapsulation begins much method is an x 4 y 42 d encapsulates the calculation of the distance between two points in a it hides implementation this is pure and is the process of taking a concrete implementation and making it applicable to albeit somewhat types of the classical example of abstraction is function which sorts thing about is that it care about the data it sorts in it what data it its input type is a typeless pointer which is just way of saying care about the type of is also called type the important point is that the implementation of always stays the regardless of data the only thing that to change is the compare which differs from data type to data therefore expects the user to provide said compare function as a function

had a who was trying to outwit our c optimizer and routine rewrote code that only he could one of his favorite tricks was changing a readable method like up some int int if return if return a long expression here return return 0 input 1 a long expression a long expression a long expression the first line of a method would become and all other logic would be replace by deeply nested terniary when you tried to argue about how this was he would point to the fact that the assembly output of his method was three or four assembly instructions it necessarily any but it was always a bit this was an embedded system where memory usage occasionally did but there were far easier optimizations that could have been made than this that would have left the code after for some reason he decided that was too so he started changing all of these into on the theory that it was more readable and faster as readable code into unreadable code for at the most a and sometimes actually slower	
had network issues causing corruption in an access database on our shared drive and i spent a lot of time cleaning up corrupted rows from a couple specific memo fields in particular were a good indication of corruption because they are not stored inline like the rest of the data but are kept in a separate i could open up the corrupted table in datasheet mode and try to determine which rows were corrupted by putting the focus on a corrupted memo there was corruption then i would immediately get an int and date columns would have odd values but would not actually throw any errors when i read their is why cycling through all records and fields in the database as shown in the vba from a previous answer makes some sense but will perform most reliably only if you have memo field

have spent a lot of time recently reading the http specification and relating it to i have found that there are two interpretations of the http delete method in regards to its and here are the two you delete a resource with http and it succeeds and then you try to delete that resource n number of you should get back a success message for each and every one of those delete this is its you delete a resource with http and it succeeds and then you try to delete that resource you should get back an error message because the resource was specification says delete is but it also says that sequences of idempotent events can still produce side i really feel like the second camp is and the first is what have we introduced by allowing clients to think they were the cause for deleting a resource previously are a lot of people in the first including several authors on the so i wanted to check if there was some compelling reason other than emotions that lead people into the first the correct way to view idempotency in terms of http

hlgem gave some good advice it exactly what i done quite a bit of testing over the past few and i figured at least share the results here given that it looks like no more information will be set up a table that was effectively a narrower subset of one of our primary and populated it with production data so that it was as deep as our production version of the then duplicated that and on the first one wrote a trigger that attempted to detect every individual column and then predicated each column update on whether the data in that column had actually changed or the second i wrote a trigger that used extensive conditional case logic to do all the updates to all the columns in a single then ran 4 update to a single update to 10000 update to a single update to 10000 repeated this test for both indexed and versions of the and then repeated the whole thing on sql 2000 and sql 2008 results i got were fairly second method single update statement with hairy case logic in the set was uniformly than the individual change detection a greater or lesser extent depending on the with the single exception of a change affecting many rows where the column was running on sql in our particular case we do many deep updates like so for my purposes the approach is definitely the way to be interested in hearing other results of similar types of to see whether my conclusions are as universal as i suspect they are or whether they are specific to our particular get you here is the test script i used obviously need to come up with other data to populate it table int not null primary i1 int i2 int i3 int v1 v2 v3 d1 datetime d2 datetime d3 datetime table int not null primary i1 int i2 int i3 int v1 v2 v3 d1 datetime d2 datetime d3 datetime optional indexing test with it on and index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on index on into test1 add data population into test2 d3 from trigger on test1 for select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where select from inserted i inner join deleted on where update test1 set i1 case when then else from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set i2 case when then else from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set i3 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set v1 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where test1 set v2 inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on update test1 set v3 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set d1 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where update test1 set d2 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on where test1 set d3 inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on trigger on test2 for update test2 i1 when then case when then else else i2 when then case when then else else i3 when then else v1 when then else v2 v3 when then else d1 when then else d2 when then else d3 from inner join inserted i on inner join deleted d on the below code can be used to confirm that the triggers operated identically over both tables after a top 10 test1 inner join test2 on or or or test 1 one one test1 set i3 64 where test2 set i3 64 where test1 set i3 64 where test2 set i3 64 where test 2 one 10000 test1 set v3 where between 10000 and test2 set v3 where between 10000 and test 3 all 1 test1 set i1 i2 i3 v1 v2 v3 am d1 d2 d3 test2 set i1 i2 i3 v1 v2 v3 am d1 d2 d3 test 4 all 10000 test1 set i1 i2 i3 v1 v2 v3 am d1 d2 d3 between 30000 and test2 set i1 i2 i3 v1 v2 v3 am d1 d2 d3 between 30000 and table table

human being is a machine that writes code and charges you money to do the advantage of a different machine might be that you have to pay it so the development costs of that machine will be so vast that it will be a long time yet before the price comes down low enough to compete with billions of cheap none of the other problems associated with software development will be made any easier by such a change of how does the customer explain what they and how does the coding machine understand their likely way we will produce such a machine is by copying the human brain genome far easier than attempting to millions of years of unfortunately this will give such as grouchiness and a desire to be taken seriously as a and before long there will be campaigns for to be properly this will push the price especially when they start going on people seem to want is a button they can labeled my mind and make me it would probably be easier to develop a button that when you press it modifies your mind so you become happy with with your present	
hunch here is probably this task will be easier to accomplish by writing a virtual midi device instead of a vst it is possible to send midi events to a sequencer using the but the problem is that the documentation never specifies how the is required to react to these many hosts simply ignore and i certainly think of one which allows easy routing from a plugin to a midi channel plogue might be able to accomplish this with audio units with the plugin though never written such a my impression was that this is what use to generate midi to the but the problem here is that not sure how the host would allow you to route audio to the plugin and accept midi from any your idea implemented as a plugin will be the most difficult to implement when you want to standardize its behavior for the most widely used i think that a far easier way to accomplish what you want is to create a virtual midi as thought of and then use rewire to route an input signal to your some resources on writing midi drivers for various device driver programming in os midi driver api

i have a simple pathfinding algorithm which precalculates the shortest route to several target each of which has a different this is somewhat equivalent to having one endpoint with a node between it and each though the edges there have different the algorithm it uses is a simple spreading which in 1d looks this this means means 3 2 4 3 2 2 handled distance 5 4 3 3 2 2 handled distance 4 4 3 2 3 2 2 handled distance 3 4 3 2 3 1 2 1 1 2 handled distance 2 any remaining rooms are suppose i have a precalculated pathfinding solution like this where only the 5 is a 5 4 3 2 1 i change the wall to a recomputing is just all distance nodes ignore the ones which already i am not able to figure out an efficient way to handle what to do if the 4 became a clearly the result is 5 in a 2d solution not sure how to efficiently deal with it is easily possible to store that 4 depends on 5 and thus needs but how do i determine its new dependency and values rather avoid recalculating the entire which is better than is to only recalculate array elements with a manhattan distance of 5 from the and to maintain source would basically mean reapplying the algorithm to a selected area but can i do how to handle changing weights

i understand ur quesstion correctly you would like to have a development webservice and a production the production instance is that last the debug instance is the current build that you are working recommended method to acheive this would be to have a dev subdomain so you can have both webservices available and both subdomains would be a different site in in you code you would bind the to the dev subdomain as this domain would be the one that you would use to update the changing the you would then use a not to change the web service object url to the www site for production way you would build against the debug service until you were happy with at which point you can update your software parameters have and upload the new dll to the release would keep webservices in a seperate project to keep the deployed assembly

interesting train of what the article on wikipedia collects a few changes in the changes in the usage updated changes through a way to stem is a constant factor two every 18 to 24 since the environment contains more than the i would assume that this forms only a very weak lower bound on actual change in the change in operations per second per dollar over is harder to but evidence in the frequency of occurrences of the words of in the say that expectations grow exponentially by looking at the development of basic economy tells us that supply is growing faster than giving law as upper bound of user use of business functionality an information system provides to a as a measure of change in required function points over depends totally on the organisation and is usually quite high immediately before a when quick fixes are pushed through and when integrating big changes to various measures like or implemented function points over time can be used as a another possibility would be in the ticketing if stay with implemented function points over change in implemented function points over can be measured as time spent implementing new time spent refactoring over bitrot would a combined unit of is of course only a very forced notation of what the wikipedia article already bitrot arises from changes in the changes in the requirements and changes to the while it is mitigated by spending time on every organisation will have to decide for itself how to measure those i only give very general

is legal as in the os stop you from doing is it you should have some type of be bits on the they will come out either as ones or but nothing to say that all your bits will be written out before another process tries to read and there are no guarantees on how fast be written vs how fast be should always assume there is absolutely no relationship between the actions of 2 processes threads for that level bus locking does not happen unless you get it it can be harder then expected to make your compiler library os cpu get it synchronization primitives are written to makes sure it happens will make it and not that hard to so just do the question has changed somewhat since my answer was the behavior you describe is defiantly platform library and giving the compiler specific you are actually not guaranteed to have 32 bits written out in one imagine a situation where the 32 bit word is not aligned on a word this unaligned access is acceptable on and in the case of the the access is turned into a series of aligned accesses by the interrupt can occurs between those if a context switch happens in the some of the bits are some lets think about 16 bit cpus or 64 bit both of which are still popular and necessarily work the way you actually you can have a situation where other picks up a word sized value written you write you code as if this type of thing is expected to happen if you are not using there are ways to preform your writes to make sure that you get a whole word written those methods fall under the category of and creating synchronization primitives is the type of thing best left to the and hardware especially if you are interested in portability you should even if you never port your

is technically possible to reach up into the parent control and have your way with the controls it but it makes for code very difficult to maintain because if you change the structure of the parent you break code in all of the contained that would be considered a very design and often somehwat cleaner design would be to have your page classes raise an event when the save button is then your parent frame can sink the event and refresh whatever it knows needs to be refreshed after a save easier to maintain because your components are more loosely but it still puts a lot of database knowledge into your gui such a design might be appropriate for a relatively simple app on which you expect to do a lot of maintenance or future design pattern i prefer do many is to isolate the database handling and business logic inside one or more classes with a simple programmatic interface that can be tested the gui components are kept as simple and thin as so they can be easily changed if this is often called a pattern but there are other names for in your the class that encapsulates your business logic would have properties and methods for reading and setting and a or method that writes changes to a once the save is complete it would raise a or event that notifies all controls displaying information that the information has changed and they would refresh themselves based on the new values of the properties of your controller

is the knapsack problem if you can either pick a product or if you can pick fractional values of products then you could solve this with the simplex but the fractional knapsack problem has a simple the items by picking of the highest ones until you run out of then pick a fractional value of the highest remaining example if prices are and energies are the ordering you would pick items 4 and 2 which would cost with the remaining you would buy of the first item for a price of and an energy of would give a total energy of that allowing fractional values will give you a higher objective value than only allowing or so no integer solution will do any better than 14 for that matter since the objective value has to be an solve the original knapsack you can use a which should work just fine in assume that you have a current candidate solution with an objective value of the relaxed where you allow the fractional if the value is less than discard this a new value z which is the solution found without the last fractional if this value is greater than replace with your new one item the first in the the most profitable and form two one where you include it in the solution and one where you include it in the solution is the branching long as you have subproblems left to pick one and go back to step that when you create the subproblem where you must pick an just subtract its price from the budget and add the value to the now you have a smaller problem to a more detailed description look at and on

kinda have to put my previous c questions on hold cause this one is more important have already coded the insert and delete functions on my binary search tree but the delete function is a couple of things i need help is my insert function good or can it be improved my delete function lacks the deletion of a node with both the left and right searched a lot in the past few hours but find a proper way to do how should i delete a node with 2 child as in the first is the delete function good or can it be this one i know it can because repeating lots of code in those ifs but i see how can i improve i need help on that struct sclientprofile struct sclienttree struct sclientprofile char int int struct sclienttree clientprofile char clienttree clienttree clientprofile clienttree new else else char int ncompare else else clienttree cliptr cliptr else clienttree cliptr else clienttree cliptr else missing delete probably notice but let me just make 2 tree uses strings instead of the normal int why i use all the i think using it not using i rather pass the pointer a structure pointer in this and work with it looks more clean somehow and in the future i want to return a success value if a node was already did my iterative version of the delete function but i like some things about maybe they can be improved but i see also tried to code the case it was deleting a node with 2 but not working as it commented the whole code where i think the code can be improved and the also named those problems as b no b c and d so we can reference to them char return clienttree currptr clienttree prevptr int ncompare prevptr currptr else prevptr currptr else the following cases have 3 lines in the calls and return is there anyway to this code and make it more of the are to be return else else return else clienttree tempptr tempptr this has a big if you take a look at the clientprofile in the first see two and one the problem is that the following code line is copying the integer not the for the string remains the old i tried to use directly on clientname but it still why everything is being copied but the is there anyway to not call the function and make the while loop once again and delete corresponding return return to properly in a binary search tree in

like to follow up with jon advice with a couple more you are writing a and are likely to have a high amount of insert use sql lock manager is if you do use sql use serializable transactions happens to be the default for the transactionscope things will fall apart on you sql compact support temporary and when you try to simulate them inside of serialized transactions it does rediculsouly stupid things like take on the index pages of the also it really eager about lock even if you use temp if you need serial access to multiple tables your best bet is to use repeatable read give atomicity and and then implement you own hierarchal lock manager based on rather than using the based you do you need to be careful john skeet to create a well defined lock you do create your own lock use fields to store information about the locks you and then add asserts every where inside the lock manager that enforce your lock hierarchy this will help to root out potential issues up any code that runs in a ui add asserts on or you should similarly add the inverse assert to code that runs in background that people looking at a method will just by looking at what threading requirements the asserts will also help to catch like even in retail means but you can make your throws look like a crash dump with an exception that says violated threading rules by doing along with stack is much easier to debug then a report from a customer on the other side of the world that says now and then the app just freezes on or it spits out gobbly

like to put an updatepanel inside the info window of google this would mean that users could interact with my application from within an info without refreshing the page and without closing the currently open info anyone know if this is you to all those who have so far very much i have gleaned from the answers is update panel has own which might be causing the updatepanel to not work correctly inside the going down the more direct route of using jquery to make ajax calls to simple web services should eliminate the hidden complexity of the updatepanel and enable the functionality i am still intrigued as to why the updatepanel approach does not and as to why using one would the of google when surely an updatepanel merely renders as html and javascript with a link to the xmlhttprequest it possible to place code inside google maps info like to place an updatepanel with some ajaxified inside the info you simply provide the html to place in the info window as a so was thinking of rendering a usercontrol to a string and placing that string in the info window for the browser to does anyone know if this is likely to this is not possible in google does anyone have any idea whether such an implementation would be possible with the corresponding virtual earth code inside google maps info	
like to share my point of view on this interesting problem as a i think i have the most efficient i remember you negate a signed integer by just flipping the first for if n 1001 1101 1110 1011 1110 0000 1110 then 0001 1101 1110 1011 1110 0000 1110 how do we define a function f that takes a signed integer and returns another signed integer with the property that taking f twice is the same as flipping the first me rephrase the question without mentioning arithmetic concepts like do we define a function f that takes a sequence of zeros and ones of length 32 and returns a sequence of zeros and ones of the same with the property that taking f twice is the same as flipping the first if you can answer the above question for 32 bit then you can also answer for 64 bit 100 bit you just apply f to the first 32 if you can answer the question for 2 bit yes it turns out that changing the first 2 bits is the take which is a signed swap the first bit and the second flip the first return the the step 2 and the step 3 together can be summerised as looks that should remind you of the 90 degree rotation of the plane and the multiplication by the squar root of i just presented the alone without the long it would seem like a rabbit out of the i wanted to explain how i got the

main difference between returning a value and returning a const reference is that you then can that reference and alter the an example of bad design and an attempt to create a smart design where easy and concise design would be more than instead of just returning a value the author makes readers of code think what intention he might have	
main difference is a core language with which you can build these programs communicate directly with the the operating system and nothing compilers exist for more or less all platforms is a language that conforms to the a program written in can not start without a cli engine a program written in communicates with the framework and with the operating you have a man in the like all servicing this man can help but it will cause additional if you want to you have a different man in the middle cli implementations do not exist for all my opinion every additional framework is a additional source of

main problem is your collision resolution algorithm you can speed up the drawing and the collision but that stop your balls collapsing into each the problem you have is much more difficult to solve cleanly than it it is possible to do it your in the configuration that fails your objects should really be sliding against each not sliding is a continuous which is different from the kind of constraints your implementation simplest thing you can do to prevent the collapse is to recheck all colliding objects to make sure they interpenetrating you do the collision handling potentially iterating as many times as necessary until of them violate the this will of course take longer possibly much longer even raises the possibility of an infinite though maybe not in that particular are good algorithms that will make your simulation but they are more complicated than your they involve considering mutually interacting bodies the balls in the as a and adjusting their collective configuration to satisfy their mutual should look for works web about i say which is likely to be most useful for your if i were i would start by visiting a good university library and looking through whatever books they have on the you should be prepared for some serious if terms like make you break out in look out if you go this you will likely learn a lot of and no small amount of	
main sources of memory leaks i can think of references to objects you need any more in some sort of so here you need to remember that all things that you add to a collection that you have reference too will stay in circular having delegates registered with an so even though you explicitly reference an it get garbage collected because one of its methods is registered as a delegate with an in these cases you need to remember to remove the delegate before discarding the with native code and failing to free even if you use managed wrappers that implement often the clr clean them fast because it understand the memory you should use the

modern ides a lot of graphics and disk io going neither of which is performed well by so if your vm responds fast enough for the developers to then say no reason why if it you either need to get a faster machines for them or go back to documenting how to setup the build other factor against vms is that if you change the you have to do it for all and document the changes if telling everyone how to set up their you might as well let them set their own system up on the base we do have vmsa for this but they tend to be for old versions of the so we can still build it without having to install the old service sdks and its but i find installing everything locally and switching between them junction to point to the build is iirc vmware has a virtualisation project called that transparently puts a os environment onto your local so you can have several conflicting applications running not used but did look into it as something that might be better than whole guest vms running in their own

my internship on interfacing i need to generate some very fast flickering squares on a crt monitor alternating between two the refresh rate is 85hz and we would like this to be the which means that repainting all squares can take at most language of preference for programming is so i tried making a prototype with because synchronous i now seem to have two the first is that time measurements show that the repainting of even 9 squares simply takes too my algorithm takes the desired frequency and calculates the times at which the system should repaint in advance and then uses a loop no that checks everytime if the next was reached and if loops through all the squares to repaint the way i implemented it now is that the squares are panels with background color a and are contained in another panel with background color b and the flickering happens because the visibility is i figured that this would be faster than one panel that has to draw rectangles all the have a decent profiling tool get eclipse tptp or netbeans profiler to so i be but i have the feeling that the bottleneck is actually not in the but in the looping conditional checking can you recommend anything about what i should second problem is that it seems like the squares are rendered like they unroll really but still this is what wondering is what causes is it or or just me writing a slow you recommend some things for me to i prefer to use but i will use c if i in this are there any for this sort of 2d programming that you can to generate simple 2d graphics in real

not sure if i should my own or use a comment for but here understanding is that volatile prevents optimizations from moving the accesses to my result variables the completed such that the the thread that reads the result will see want the boolean made visible to all threads the due to compiler or emmpry you want the writes to the results being seen after the further on the in regards to items mentioned by matt i should point out whenever a thread calls an the cpu forces so if you are variables via interlocked do not have to worry about all of memory model thread synchronization locks call interlocked it would seem as pointed that the result do not require the volatile keyword the example as shown since manualresetevent ensures you are both in agreement that such an operation takes care of caching between processors or in registers does it prevent reording to guarantee such that both the results are assigned the completed and that the completed flag is assigned true the manualresetevent is my initial assumption was the background thread potentially run multiple obviously overlooked the name of class given it is only run it is not to me why the calls in the manner that what is the point of initialwaitms milliseconds if background thread may or may not done at the time why not just kickoff background thread and use a lock synchronize access to the variables or simply execute contents of the function part of the thread that is there a reason to do concept of the sample is to execute a if the task can be completed within an exceptable amount of then the calling thread will get access to the result and continue with normal but sometime a task can take quite a long time and the claiing thread cannot be blocked for that period and can take reasonable steps to deal with that can include checking back later on the operation using the completed concrete a dns resolve is often very quick and worth waiting for even from a but sometimes it can take many many so by using a utility class like the one could gets a result easily from the of the caller of the time and not lock up the gui the other one could use a background but that can be overkill for an operation that the vast majority of the time need all that it seems to me that not some kind of locking mechanism on results variables is still a it is not needed the code as result completed data is meant to be if i added a lock to assign the results and also have to lock in my result and i never liked seeing getters lock just to return a data from my such locking is not if an operation has 5 or 6 the caller has to take and release the lock 5 or 6 times at some down the another thread may along and try to access the would be better in my mind to for this possibility now rather try to track down mysterious anomalies i have a volatile completed flag that is guarenteed to be set the volatile results and the only access to the results is through the and as mentioned in the an exception is thrown if the getter is called and the operation is not yet expect that the completed and result getters can be invoked by a thread other than the one that called my hope i believe this to be true with the volatiles

not sure what you are worried from where i sit i can see three things your question can be related you may want to prevent unauthorized users from making a valid this is resolve by using the cookie to store a session the session id needs to tied to the be regenerated every time the user goes through the login process and must have an inactivity anybody request coming in without a valid session id you simply you may want to prevent a third party from doing a replay attacks against your site sniffing an inocent traffic and then sending the same calls the easy solution is to go over https for the ssl layer will prevent somebody from replaying any part of the this comes at a cost on the server side so you want to make sure that you really cannot take that you may want to prevent somebody from using your api what ajax calls are in the to implement his own client to your for this there is very little you can you can always look for the appropriate but easy to fake and will be probably the first thing somebody trying to use your api will think you can always implement some for example looking at the average ajax requests per minute on a per user basis and see if some user are way above your hard to implement and only usefull if you are trying to prevent automated clients reacting faster than human

on the learning curve up the silverlight a developer so i naturally picked up the data services client along the scratching my head over a scenario and seem to find any help in blogs got a complex tutor entity with related entity sets for and also got a couple other sets like subjects and along with all this come foreign keys to lookup tables for things like addresstypes business emailtypes and so all this is encapsulated in an edmx in my model a portion of the silverlight got a usercontrol that is a data entry form for this created a dto like object for the data binding to the textbox well till the user clicks save routine creates and adds a tutor and person objects and adds them to the dataservicecontext and links them where running into trouble is that i have to add a related entity already stored in the context on the database such as code the person may have multiple subject elementary elementary science the tutorsubjectset has to relate to 3 other subject subjectlevel and then to the my dto has a list of combined items that presents a of a true cartesian selection no such thing as elementary calculus at least not where i went to school that list shows up as a checkbox list on the when the user clicks save i pick up the checked items and i try to do a lookup on the combined and values against the code tables that have those is where in a be ok because i can do those lookups and get the entity in an async how do i get the related entities while busy assembling the person doing an async call in the middle of the save process tried various i tried making an replica of the subjectlevel using the and attaching that to the context as static subjectlevel var subjectlevel new subjectlevelid description effectivedate enteredby entereddate type try catch tries to catch situations where the level has already been created return approach works for situations where there are no duplicates also has the advantage that i have to do an additional for example in there will be only one home address have a similar notice i have a that catches the error if the items is already inserted into the if the item has already been inserted and i hit that the returned subjectlevel is not attached to the i get an error since the item is not being i retrieve an existing subjectlevel without issuing an async query against the subjectlevelset even if in my local like to do lev null lev i method is not which i assume means i have to do the query async so back to the same also tried to retrieve a list of subjectlevels in the loaded event that way have the set of subjectelements on hand when the save button is same i have to issue an async call to do a search even if got it i tried iterating through the list for the one i needed but that gave me an error saying that the entity was not being tracked by the clearly not understanding this and am doing it wrong but i find any practical examples that do this kind of the examples just happily load primitives into the entity to be no examples that seen show related entities and how to retrieve i could make it simple and just store integer values for the codeid and not relate them via but that would be too much of a for any help you can provide entity creation with related code

once did some research toward improving and the problem with simulating 3d audio is that so many of the cues that your mind uses the slightly different attenuation at various the frequency difference between sounds in front of you and those behind you are quite specific to your head and are not quite the same for anyone you a pair of headphones to really make it sound like a creature is in the leaves ahead and in front of the character in a then you actually have to take that player into a measure how their own particular ears and head change the amplitude and phase of the sound at different distances and phase are and are both quite important to the way your brain processes sound and then teach the game to attenuate and the sounds for that particular do exist that have been mocked up with plastic and used to get generic curves for the various directions around the but an average or standard will never sound quite right to most the current technology is basically to sell the player five cheap have them place them around their and then the sounds while not particularly well reproduced actually do sound like coming from behind or beside the player they coming from the speaker behind the some games do bother to be careful to compute how sound would be muffled and attenuated through walls and doors can get difficult to because the ear receives the same sound at a few milliseconds different delay through various materials and reflective surfaces in the all of which would have to be included if things were to sound they tend to keep their libraries under so public reference implementations like openal tend to be pretty here is a link to an online data set that i found at the that could be used as a starting point for creating a more realistic openal sound from craig craig

other answers are good either hashing you are comparing the file to multiple or a comparison comparing two single are a couple of additional check the file sizes if they are then waste time comparing these are quick to try searching from the end or the middle of the file using a binary chop suppose you have a file like it is modified to the file size to remain the and content to have been the other bytes will be so a binary chop approach might pick this up with less reads in seek to and read bytes to from both and could try to combine the if you do it over a good enough sample of the data you deal you might find that of all the different files you compare were found because the file size was different per were found due to binary chop per were found due to linear byte comparisons per a binary chop over the whole file be so since i expect the hard disk will be faster if reading linearly rather than seeking to random but if you check then then for say 5 you might find most of the differences without having to do a bytewise some instead of reading from the front of the perhaps try reading from the end of the file again you might be trading off seek time for but in the assuming a change is made halfway into the probably find this faster by starting from the end than from the

our large based project we now have a method to automatically generate code to expose our code as soap this works really and we are planning to start implementing an ria based application using adobe air flex based on the we have question i have is about organizing soap the code i have exposes individual method calls which in our code belong to thus far i have named the exposed methods by prefixing them with the name of the class which they came from in ideally there would be a way to group methods logically within the soap service so that i have to take this step and it would be possible to ask for the services in a particular group once you have bound to the soap services using the wsdl file in your target really like to be able to reproduce the class structure that lies behind the soap layer on the server side in our client right i can see that i could do this by using the method names to determine what class they belong but if i could separate them in a cleaner way i would prefer forward to hearing what you soap gurus know about this there a way to group a set of soap methods logically in a type

personally would always go with the two where clauses whenever it make the statement your it probably be noticeble at but having 2 where clauses definitely will have a performance impact if you have a large and if you use all of the results from this for if you call on the or iterate through the entire the first where clause will creating a new ienumerable that will be completely enumerated with a second the 2 clauses together causes the query to form a single delegate that gets run as the collection is this results in one enumeration through the collection and one call to the delegate each time a result is you split things as your first where clause enumerates through the original the second where clause enumerates this potentially 2 full enumerations through your collection and 2 delegates called per which could mean this statement could take 2x the runtime you do decide to use 2 where placing the more restrictive clause first will help quite a since the second where clause is only run on the elements that pass the first in your this on a large it as a general rule of i go readability and this i think both options are equally so go for the more performant

pointed out by pete this is implementation my answer is only correct for the sun and only prior to java 7 update right about a normal call just creating a new string referring to the same character array as the original what happens on line 5 the fact that the new string object reference happens to be assigned to a variable change the behaviour of the to be you say that in line 2 the new string will still point to the char array reference inside the string will be to the same char array as one used for but is a string in not a char in other by the time line 2 has finished ignoring there are two string both referring to the same char one has a count of 6 and the other has a count of both have an offset of wrong about line 4 using a though no pooling going on it is different to the other when you call the the new string takes a of the character data of the so completely this can be very useful if you only need a string which contains a small part of a very large original it allows the original large char array to be garbage collected nothing else needs while you hold onto the copy of the small a good example of this in my own experience is reading lines from a by will read lines using an so every string returned will use a char array of at least 80 if reading lots of very short lines the difference in terms of memory consumption just through the use of the new be very that

possible try using another profiler netbeans one works this may be hard to do depending on how your code is is possible just like many other a different profiler will result in different returning a local primitive really take longer than returning calculated an instance variable takes longer than returning an local variable the getter that you have is simple so it should be so it becomes as fast as accessing a public instance variable is slower than accessing a local you have a local value meaning in the method as opposed to in the exactly do you mean by i look at metric other than base have not used the eclipse so i am not sure how it it might make a difference if it is a tracing or a sampling profiler two can give different results for things like these results misleading and i need to consider some profiling would consider another just to see if the result is the based on it is a sampling profiler what that every the program is sampled to see where the program if you are calling the one method way more than the other it will show up as being in the method that is called more is simply more likely that that method is being tracing profiler adds code to your program process known as to essentially log what is going profilers are slower but more they also require that the program be changed instrumentation which could potentially introduce bugs that i have heard of it but i am sure it does at least while they are developing the profilers are faster but less accurate just guess at how often a line of code is if eclipse uses a sampling profiler you could see what you consider to be strange changing to a tracing profiler would show more accurate eclipse uses a tracing profiler then chaning profilers should show the same result they new profiler may make it more obvious to you as to what is going

problem with using a progress bar is often a process takes multiple different so if i were doing a progress dialog for a software i use a single progress but a task list with check marks so the user can see what task is being performed at the a progress bar next to the task if taking longer than 10 seconds so they can see that work is being done and they abort it too running tasks are nice because past performance strongly indicates future the first 10 seconds will likely show you how long the remainder of the file same with the update processes need a progress so even display one on any process until that one process has taken 10 seconds or that way the user on a fast system just sees a checkmark on each and on a slow system the user sees the and if it stays on a task they get the progress bar with actually useful the progress bar make any promises about how long the later tasks will an overall time at the bottom that covers best guess for all tasks is very but i show that on a progress thing about progress bars is they are meant to travel when they jump and stutter very frustrating for the user they are actually less useful and give the wrong information in that the right tool for the too many times a progress bar is chosen when actually the wrong

production animators use specialized tools such as 3ds max to generate keyframed animations of 3d for each animation for each the animator constructs a number of poses for the model called the which are then exported out into the data game then loads these and to animate the model at a particular it picks the two nearest keyframes and interpolates between them to give a smooth even with a small number of models are typically constructed with a bone there is a root which controls the location and orientation within the game all of the other bones are defined relative to some parent bone to create a each vertex of the model is tied to a particular so the model can be controlled with a much smaller number of the relative and scales of each skinning is a technique used to improve the quality of with smooth a vertex is not tied to just one but it can be tied to multiple bones a hard such as is vertices rarely need more than with corresponding this makes the job since he has to do a lot more work with vertices near but the result is a much smoother animation with less distortion around the some games use whereby the animation data is constructed at the bone positions and orientations are computed according to some such as or other options are of course but they must be coded by of procedurally animating the bones and using forward kinematics to determine the locations of all of the another option is to just procedurally generate the position of each vertex on its this allows for more complex animations that bound by bone but of course much more complicated and much harder to do	
programming specifically says not to do what you are asking is possible to assign any arbitrary integer value to for this line of code does not produce an meetingday you should not do this because the implicit expectation is that an enum variable will only hold one of the values defined by the to assign an arbitrary value to a variable of an enumeration type is to introduce a high risk for is really only the storage in possible to specify other integer storage like days byte storage type determines how much memory an enum

question should what would you do with that if you have clear business do did something similar and after 3 years of running there is about of and rest is and it is 10 million 40 million in last three years we had 2 requests to investigate history of changes and both times requests were silly we record time stamp of record change and we were asked to check if persons worked overtime we are stuck with oversized database that contains of data that nobody you asked for possible describe what we a bit different than solution you are tables have surrogate primary primary keys are generated from single this works fine because oracle can generate and cache so no performance problems we use orm and we wanted each object in memory corresponding record in to have unique use orm and mapping information between database table and class is in form of record all changes in single archive table with following primary of original type data as varchar2 is actual data in form of works this has and delete created one base class for all our business objects that overrides and delete commands commands create string in form of pairs using code looks for mapping information and reads field associated value and field then we create something similar to json added some when string representing current state of object is it is inserted into archive new or updated object is saved to database it is saved to his target table and at the same time we insert one record with current value into archive object is we delete it from his target table and at the same time we insert one record in archive table that have transaction type have archive tables for each table in we also need to worry about updating archive table when schema archive is separated from so archive does not impose any performance hit on we put it onto separate tablespace on separate disk and it works created 2 forms for viewing viewer that can list archive table according to filter on archive filter data user can enter on form we show each record in form and each change is color users can see all versions for each record and they can see who and when made viewer this one was but we created form that shows invoice very similar to original invoice entry but with some additional buttons that can show different it took considerable effort to create this form was used few times and then forgotten because it was not needed in current for creating archive records is located in single there is no need for triggers on every table in is very at peak system is used by around this is both and oracle are running on one dual xeon with 8gb table archive format is harder to read than solution where there is one archive table for each of the data on field in archive table is hard we can use only operator on the requirements on it is not trivial but gains and use can be

read in a comment that your intended use is adding vectors and maybe you should consider using only matrices where vectors are one dimensional then you are left with just one type and one set of matrix matrix b matrix matrix b and so you want to keep the vector class then you should consider whether you also want a transposed vector transpose is just an internal property of set of operations is not really matrix matrix vector you should offer those three operations transpose is a property of vector matrix m matrix vector v matrix matrix m2 vector vector v2 possibly 1x1 you cannot overload changing only return as free functions if even if the above set is not neither is the real world and your users will expect

real consideration between separate date and time fields or 1 datetime field is you do not want to do from where a datetime field because it use an mysql will convert the startat data to a date in order to compare which means it use the want to do from where startat between and problem with a datetime field is that you really use it a compound index since the value is fairly for a compound index on going to allow you to search on only if you split the data between date and time you can index and search on it just an example for discussion you could obviously index on instead and it would but you may find yourself wanting to based on date plus another creating a compound index on that data would make it very

reason you get that error is that the default constructor for a wcf client proxy looks up the channel configuration from local you can override this behavior by specifying the binding and address you want to use connect have several options each with a different deployment the endpoint information in your library common term for this is you would just return new for this only distribute the assembly your wsgateway code was in called a common configuration file that all sites have access if these are all services on the same this is easy to place configuration data in a shared common drive location and read it from if you want the full gamut of possible wcf configuration to be need to use the method and read it manually and apply it manually to your binding before your open the client for this you would ensure you centrally located config file was accessible and distribute you wsgateway your configuration to a common resource accessible from all like a this would allow you to access this configuration data from any point in your for this you would ensure your configuration database was accessible from all points in your solution and distribute your wsgateway are the solutions i could think of off the top of my let us know what you decide to

recently had to update a relatively large control library that uses ninject to ninject to help resolve some issues i had with the update has gone well and i think ninject is a lot to try and avoid this problem in the future i have created my own interface for injecting fields and properties will essentially call methods on the ioc container i wish to use within the current web so now my control library is independant of any particular ioc container which will speed up any changes in that area in the was wondering has anyone else has done the same happy with what it has achieved but ideally i would like to update in my controls i create these injected fields often as protected and set them in the constructor for that problem i have with the above is that i have to use on all objects to actually set the property and i cannot use that on properties would prefer to do something along these lines but i think it is anyone got any ideas of how to neaten the code up or make it work in a cleaner i also would want to avoid attributes so it forces the developer to make a decision to inject the variable at a certain point within the thoughts and feelings are of control for your inversion of control

seems concise enough for what you want to look numbered which is still used as the internal version developed under jsr tiger added a number of significant new language provides type safety for collections and eliminates the need for most typecasts by jsr also called allows language constructs such as classes and methods to be tagged with additional which can then be processed by by jsr automatic conversions between primitive types as and primitive wrapper classes as by jsr the enum keyword creates a ordered list of values as previously this could only be achieved by constant integers or manually constructed classes enum by jsr new skinnable look and called the last parameter of a method can now be declared using a type name followed by three dots void in the calling code any number of parameters of that type can be used and they are then placed in an array to be passed to the or alternatively the calling code can pass an array of that for each the for loop syntax is extended with special syntax for iterating over each member of either an array or any such as the standard collection classes by jsr the previously broken semantics of the java memory which defines how threads interact through stub generation for rmi is the last release of java to officially support the microsoft windows 9x line windows windows java se 6 update 7 is the last version of java to be shown working on this family of operating concurrency utilities in package entered its on 2008 april 8 and will be unsupported by sun as of 2009 october se 6 as of this sun replaced the name with java se and dropped the from the version internal numbering for developers remains this version was developed under jsr the development new builds including enhancements and bug fixes were released approximately beta versions were released in february and june leading up to a final release that occurred on december the current revision is update 12 which was released in february changes included in this for older win9x versions unofficially java 6 update 7 is the last release of java shown to work on these versions of this is believed to be due to the major changes in update language support generic api for tight integration with scripting and mozilla javascript rhino performance improvements for the core and web service support through support compiler api an api allowing a java program to select and invoke a java compiler of jaxb to version including integration of a stax for pluggable annotations gui such as integration of swingworker in the table sorting and and true swing the se 6 update se 6 update 10 known as java se 6 update while it does not change any public is meant as a major enhancement in terms of the release version is currently available for changes for this update deployment a set of javascript functions to ease the deployment of applets and java web start a small installer including only the most commonly used jre other packages are downloaded when versioning and pack200 support is no longer quick to improve cold performance of java2d graphics primitives on using direct3d and hardware new swing look and feel called nimbus and based on java applets now run in a separate process and support many features of web start

setting up a large database that will generate statistical reports from incoming system will for the most part operate as rows about 30 mostly and datetime will be uploaded each its approximately 60mb while in flat file but grows steeply in the db with the addition of suitable statistics will be generated from the current from these statistics will be generated and data set will get copied into a partitioned history the the current data set was not can be queried by end users for information that is not likely to include but relationships between may request specialized searches from the history but the queries will be crafted by a the next the current data table is will essentially be version 2 of our existing using mysql myisam tables was killing on space usage and suffering greatly on and is currently not a partitioned tabled as support in order to get around the tremendous amount of time and its taking to insert records into writing each day to an unindexed and then on the weekends during our slowest writing the queue to the history the problem is that any historical queries generated in the week are possibly several days behind we reduce the indexes on the historical table or its queries become definitely moving to at least mysql we stay with for the next release but strongly considering i know that debate has been done to but i was wondering if anybody had any advice relevant to this most of the research is revolving around web site indexing is really our main beef with mysql and it seems like postgresql may help us out through partial indexes and indexes based on read dozens of articles about the differences between the but most are postgresql has long been labeled but is that still generally the case comparing mysql to postgresql or is it more balanced databases and ms are simply not an option although i wish oracle on myisam vs innodb for were running innodb and for we found it much like times we were also much newer to mysql and frankly not sure we had db tuned appropriately for running in an environment with a very high degree of uptime battery network backup fully redundant so the integrity concerns with myisam were weighed and deemed regards to heard the stability issues concern with generally i assume that any recently last 12 piece of software is not the updated feature set in is just too much to pass up given the chance to the regards to postgresql without any where clause is a pretty rare case for i anticipate this being an from nearly as flexible as load data infile but an intermediate loading table will fix biggest concern is the lack of insert often used it when building some processing table so that we could avoid putting multiple records in twice and then having to do a giant group by at the end just to remove some i think its used just infrequently enough for the lack of it to be for	
setting up some selenium tests for an internal web app and looking for advice on a testing one of the tests is going to add some data via the ui that cannot be removed via the ui you can add a record via the web but removing requires contacting someone internally to remove it at the database how do you typically account for cleaning up data after the selenium test is app in question is written in php and using php for testing selenium rc and but open to other as this is just a broad best practice the app being tested is in our development so not particularly worried about data carrying over from connect to the database in the selenium test to cleanup the something like to manage add data and worry about cleaning it up the lazy seems most of the ideas centered around the same work off a known set of data and restore when the tests are the mechanism for this probably will vary depending on amount of but this looks like it should work for my up data after a selenium

solution to this problem achieves a couple of but unfortunately there are plenty of other issues that it you are worried that the output array might not even have a valid terminated c string in then addressed that issue by inserting a by brute additionally chosen the optimal the last byte of the array be used for anything else if the array is supposed to hold a terminated done nothing to stop the called function trampling over memory beyond the array allocated for the number one thing be worried memory trampling buffer rocket but it does demand discipline and usually the basic idea involved is to never simply pass the address of some memory to be but instead to always accompany that address with the length of the memory block of course the called code must respect the limitation thus imposed on it looks like you know about the basic idea since you mention which is the classic example of this

tells core start running this core not it only knows about executable code and various running levels and associated limitations to instructions that can be computer for sake of simplicity only one is active and actually runs any then if os is multiprocessor it activates other cores with some system specific other cores most likely pick up from exactly same spot as other core and run from what scheduler does is it looks through os internal structures and picks one and marks it as running at its then other scheduler instances running on other cores touch it until the task is in waiting state again not marked as pinned to specific after task is marked as scheduler executes switch to userland with task resuming at the point it was previously there is nothing whatsoever stopping cores from running exact same code at exact same time many unlocked functions but unless code is written to expect it will probably piss all over goes weirder with more exotic memory models assumes linear single working memory where cores necessarily all see same memory and there may be requirements on fetching code from other but much easier handled by simply keeping task pinned to core sony ps3 architecture with is like

test collision detections between 2 oriented bounding use separating axis theorem in fact sat can be used for collision detection between any 2 convex this technique is not overly complex to understand and has a reasonable theorem can easily be extended to algorithm tries to determine is it is possible to fit a plane between two if such a plane then the object are and cannot determine if the objects are it is simply a matter of projecting the objects onto the of the and comparing the intervals and see if they there is obviously an infinite number of planes that can fit between two separated but it has been proved you only have to test a handful of can be shown that for the separation planes to be tested are the planes with normal equal to the axes of both so for 2 you only need to test 4 separation planes in out of the 4 once you found a separation plane that separates the then you know the box cannot and you return a no collision the 4 planes cannot separate the then the box must be and there you have a

that comparable is also a generic parameterized by what type it is comparable the most way to declare your mergesort function above extends super enforces that the type compareto method can accept an argument of type a type could implement but not be comparable to like implements so it is important to have the requirement on the type parameter of in any comparable class should be comparable to at least require that extends super instead of just extends because it is okay if a type method accepts a more general type than because it would still be able to accept an argument of type this is important if you have a class which implements and then you have a subclass b which extends b cannot implement because b already implements inherited from and a class cannot implement an interface so if we required extends b would not satisfy and we would not be able to sort

the author of one of the features gitx has is the visualization of as can be seen visualization is currently done by reading commits which are emitted from git in the correct for each commit the parents are so fairly easy to build up the lanes in the correct like to speed up this process by using my own commit pool and linearizing the commits this allows me to reuse existing loaded commits and allows git to emit commits faster because it have to emit them in the correct not sure what algorithm to use to accomplish it is important that the building is as the loading of commits can take a long time seconds for which should all be has gone the same and a patch that shows how it is but my tcl skills are weak and the patch very thoroughly commented and a bit hard to also like this algorithm to be as have to handle hundreds of thousands of it also has to be displayed in a so important that access to specific rows is describe the input i have so the output that i want and a few have a current pool of commits in the form of a hash table that maps commit ids to commit this pool does not have to be complete all commits have a separate thread loading in new commits from with a callback that can be called every time a new commit is there is no guaranteed order in which the commits come but in most of the cases the next commit is a parent of the previous commit object has its own revision id and the revision ids of all its have a list of branch heads that should be that there a single of the dag that should be there also does not have to be a single graph need to linearize these commits in topological that a commit cannot be listed after its parents have been also need the that can be seen in the screenshot these probably need to be precomputed as most of them depend on their few necessary to relocate a list of for we might have to commits that are until a commit shows up which makes one head an ancestor of the branch tips must be important that this process is so that at least a partial view is available while the data is still this means that new data has to be inserted halfway and that the branch lines have to be hope i have described the problem clear enough linearizing of git

the jist of some code i am currently using in a production app that works got a bit extra in there to handle the case where the client are server apps are running on a standalone job is to receive udp notifications that messages are ready for as mentioned by adam alexander your only problem is that you need to use instead of you would only use when you wanted to a broadcast udp up the udp client new new only if you want to on same to trigger the start of an async receive using a this you should be able to adapt it to working synchronously without too much very similar to what you are if still getting the error after this then something else must be using the port that you are trying to listen to used to i want to listen for a packet arriving on any ip used to i want to send a packet to anyone who is

the nat in front of the client at the tcp level will be able to determine that the connection at the udp was having said the nat on the client side will have to be configured to accept udp packets from the src server and then forward them to the internal destination ip important thing to remember if nat is who is the caller and who is the nats differ in implementation and capablity so a generic easy to implement solution is probably what you might want to depending on your are correct in i that in your case client will not be able to receive the udp stream in in your case your client will have to send its wan ip to your server to initiate the udp finding your clients wan ip can be tricky but there are websites that will aid your determing your wan ip by returning it in a text the udp connection is created after the tcp connection by the server opening a socket to the client to a known udp port upnp might be worth looking into it will allow you to automatically set up your port forwards on your that is only if your nat supports upnp as is the case of dsl would be to client to open both tcp and udp sockets to the since the client behind the nat initiated the connection the states of both tcp and udp connections will be added to the connection

there a way to use the method to compile the expression associated with an currently i have an iqueryable with a very large expression tree behind the iqueryable was built up using several methods which each supply for two methods may return iqueryables which are then joined in a for this reason i explicitly define the entire expression within the method was hoping to pass the expression in to the compile method as however this expression in the form required by the compile if i try and get around this by putting the query directly into the compile var foo var bar i make the call form within a i get an error saying that is not mapped as a stored procedure or again i just copy the contents of the getusers method to where i make the compile call since it in turn makes use of other there some way to pass the expression on the iqueryable returned from into the compile tried to force my will on the system with the following var phony wishful var foo ends up have the option to see the results in as instead of offering to expand the results and run the query i only see the message could destabilize the just need to find a way for the sql string to only be generated once and used as a paramaterized command on subsequent i can do this manually using the getcommand method on the data but then i have to explicitly set all the parameters and do the object mapping which is a few hundred lines of code given the complexity of this particular rusk provided the most useful so i awarded him the win on this some extra tweaking was required and there were a couple of other issues i encountered along the way so i thought on the the could destabalize the error was not due to the compilation of the it was actually because of some casting deep in the expression in some places i needed to call the method to formally cast even when they were of the correct without going into too much detail this was basically required when several expression were combined into a single tree and each branch could return a different which were each the sub type of a common solving the destabalizing i returned to the compilation expand solution was almost it looked for method call expressions in the tree and tried to resolve them to the underlying expression that method would usually my references to expressions were not provided by method but instead so i needed to modify the expression visitor that performs the expansion to include these override expression return new return method may not be appropriate in all but it should help anyone who finds themselves in the same linq to sql queries from a

think all qa is developers must test their own code to ensure it does what he thinks it should do and it break the testers should test against the specifications to see if the developer interpreted them correctly testing almost never finds these peers should do code reviews to ensure that standards are followed and to promote users must do testing as well as they will try to do things that nobody expected or defined in the often these are stupid things that make us shake out heads and would anyone every think to do but many others are genuine requirements that were not in the spec because nobody bothered to ask the users what they client acceptance testing should be done especially if you do custom development for different it is far easier to show that a new request for work is new development rather than a if the client has signed off on the work before it went to this can save tons of contractual battles over who is to pay for having someone else fix your bad code is the best way to ensure that bad code will continue to be produced which why i hate the organizational structure that some companies have of having developers who do new things and support people who do further a manager who fixes bad code to save time without sending it back to the developer to fix is causing problems for the organization not fixing big part of qa in my mind is taking the time up front to actually define the requirements and they will change through any large but they still are without testing is random at without standards maintenance can become a nightmare and far more costly than need last part of qa is learning from our unfortunately in many organizations you honestly have a post project discussion of what went wrong and how to prevent that next time without getting into a blame session that causes people be quiet rather than get bad marks against them for their performance in fact performance appraisals in general are harmful to the goal of improving quality for this reason among many up deming and total quality management to see the quality thoughts on the harm caused by performance theory there should be quality metrics that you can use to measure imporved in practice as long as your organization has performance these numbers will often be to make things look better or measure the worng thing lines of code mean better code in all cases and more bug reports might mean we are doing a better job of finding at least the bugs not that the code is worse than in a past and are thus

think doing this at the repository level is a much better mostly because you in the decide to add some method of access to your repository which does not go through mvc a wcf interface to the the question how do you address the cons listed about doing it on the nhibernate out the useful entities is simple i would probably do this via a custom attribute on the entity you can tag the entities you want to or the ones you whichever is out what the controller really intended is going to dispute that you can the i think it is a good idea to do this in a because the separation of the repository should not be dependent on the one method would be to create custom methods on the repository for actions like to track this is especially attractive if there are other aspects of these edits which behave such as different another method is to examine the changes by comparing the old and new versions of the objects and derive the actual nature of the a third method is to make no attempt to derive the nature of the but just store the before and after versions in the log so that the person who reads the log can figure it out for	
think going about this the wrong your plan be to update all current code to java your plan should be to ensure that all current code runs exactly the same in as it did in and that all future code written will work fine in gone through a few transitions like this of varied sized code the goal was always to make sure we had a ton of unit tests so that we could easily plug in and run our tests through we actually encountered about 10 mostly related to regular expression libraries not supporting something or supporting something all new code in and if you change an older class for whatever spend a minute and implement but no reason to refactor that sounds a bit dangerous to me if you have the tests in

think submodules are the way to go when it comes to is how you should use just a you develop both main project and within the same directory is called a you tag and merge the all to view your as a is a branch which allows you to access a version of a vendor external component or of and which is only updated with the new version every release of that external that is called a the all system is viewed as a collection of separate components developed on their two approaches are not first strategy is compatible with a you are working both on project and second one is used with but submodules is used to define a of tag you need to each git unlike are pinned to a particular commit and that is what allows you to define a in like the second approach because most of the when you have a project and a their is different are not developed at the same not tagged together at the same nor with the same really prevents that approach in your question is the can be developed and updated from the same working would really urge you to reconsider that as most ide are perfectly capable to deals with multiple and the development can be done in its own dedicated an emap plugin for both joomla and both the plugin and the code is part of not of are developed while the plugin is inside all paths are the structure is and they must be distributed together even though each project has its own i understand you are in a configuration where the development environment set of files you are working is quite the same than the distribution environment same set of file is copied on the release all comes done to a granularity both sets of files cannot exist one without the then they should be viewed as one big project but that force them to be tagged and merged as one depends on the other can be developed then they should be in their own git repository and the first one depending on a specific commit of the second as a if the is defined in the right subtree of the first all relative paths are original thread listed issues with submodules primarily that download include them to and that they get stuck on a particular am not sure download is an issue that developing with article does of people cloning your fork will have no problem pulling down your as registered the public clone url for the the gh submodule gh submodule pull the submodules into the current for the get stuck on a particular that is the all point of a allowing you to work with a of tagged version of instead of a latest potentially unstable set of need to avoid both subtrees and submodules and would rather address this need without arguing too much if the approach is requirement is a perfectly legitimate and i do not want to judge its my previous answers are only here to provide a larger context and try to illustrate the options usually available with a generic scm merge should be the answer but would imply to merge back only commits made for files for the main and not commits made for the if you can manage that kind of partial i would reckon it is the right path to do not see however a native git way to do what you want that does not use or hope a true git guru will post here a more adequate

think that there are some things to do before you tackle the technical question what technology do i create the true knowledge and understanding of the system is what lies beyond the actual interface relationships and module it is the understanding of the whole system and how the individual parts in it contribute to the would go in the following try to the system this means to first understand the structure of the modules and create some representation of from the top this you will probably find additional metadata on the modules that does not exist in your current take the time to add it will be most useful when you later create the automatic because it will reflect the knowledge on the system write a simple program that will generate a set of files from the that will help you browse and navigate the information more easily as a starting point for further i would not go into a fully fledged javadoc format in the start small and evolve your in as needs this process you would also discover where refactoring would make use the output of your htmls to research structure of several modules and reach understanding of internal of are there naming repeated anything that you can deduce and is not obviously documented already in the would create some local uml but not of a size that will get out of hand perhaps several umls per mark dependencies to external modules in a distinct generation of automated umls will not be as it is the of meaningful interfaces in each diagram that will make the most enlightening umls in the think the final result of a set of htmls and umls will be a good final

think the solution to your problem is a combination of what people have mentioned override initialize and load your xml document the server property should be valid at that use to retrieve the resource from within your web site directory public abstract class basecontroller protected override void xdocument buttonsxmldoc note that when calling use the application rooted path to the resource begin the path with the tilde character this is the reason seeing the error not find a part of the path you use any relative file system paths are relative to the executing which in this case would be calling will translate the resource specified as relative to your web virtual directory hierarchy to a physical file system for your side issue regarding the location of the xml i would recommend that is used since files stored in that folder are not served when

think you are approaching the problem from a viewpoint that is less than are focusing on the compiler lack instead of focusing on the most probable answer to your main questions is the hardware support all that embedded hardware are noted for the customization of the hardware design memory interrupt my you should first spend some time with the hardware book for the learning the ins and outs of the device how it was designed and for what primary some were designed for fast memory some for fast some for type some for signal the type of microcontroller dictates the assembler instructions they wrote for and that dictates what any compiler can do this is spend some time to look at the assembler as well it will tell you what the designers considered it will also tell you a lot about how much you can get from a microcontrollers support because the design really care about or fancy memory handling the it can be but you are often trying to pound a round peg in a square hole to get constructors and destructors and to work in the micro you have a c compiler for this consider it a a good c compiler is often than to create excellent embedded	
think you are interpreting it the wrong way in culture is really just a long way of saying as the is not the decimal so if you ask for the string to be with the culture you should indeed get the deouble if you ask it to parse you should get a double of if you ask it to the double you should get the string in

this i would go for a member rule i follow is that if a function has to access something that is internal of the current state of the then it should be part of the of the this the connectedness of a and b depends on the state of your object you could end up having a class having too many in this the keep it simple factor kicks in and you should consider if your class is trying to do too it would then be convenient to have a separated class in your a whose specific role is to hold algorithms that can traverse and act on your maze	
this is an unconventional solution but write yourself a code i have done this several times using so in my case i auto inspect a table which columns it contains and types and generate classes from more work upfront but does exactly what you want and is reusable in subsequent

through controls can work but error i worked on a project that used that technique it was a delphi project not and it did work as expected but it was very difficult to update if a control was added or this may have been not it worked by creating a single event handler which was then attached to each the handler would then use rtti to determine the type of the then it would use the name property in a large select statement to find the validation code to if the validation an error message was sent to the user and the control was given to make things more the form was divided into several tabs and the proper tab had to be visible for child control to get the my would much rather use a passive view design pattern to remove all business rules from the form and push them into a presenter depending on the state of your form that may be more work than your willing to

unsure of exactly what you are are you trying to get an equivalent structure definition in for plain old usage or for interop if for pinvoke the follownig structure will struct tpacket public ushort public ushort public byte public byte public you are looking for a plain old structure that has the same unfortunately not possible to do with a you cannot define an inline array of a contstant size in a structure nor can you force the array to be a specific size through an are two alternative options in the managed a struct which has a create method that fills out the array struct tpacket public ushort public ushort public byte public byte public public static tpacket return new array123 new alternatively use a class where you can initialize the array123 member variable op watns to know how to convert a into a tpacket there is no great way to do this in was awesome for this kind of task because has a very weak type system in that you could choose to view a stream of bytes as a particular structure pointer may be possible in unsafe code but i do not believe it what you will have to do is manually parse out the bytes and assign them to the various values in the or write a native method which does the c style casting and pinvoke into that

updated the example to better illustrate my i realised it was missing one specific point namely the fact that the method always takes a label type so the factory can decide what type of label to thing it might need to obtain more or less information depending on what type of label it wants to have a factory class that returns objects representing labels to be sent to a factory class looks like class largelabel public string trackingreference private public trackingreference class smalllabel public string trackingreference private public trackingreference class public ilabel string switch case return new case return new that i create a new label called i want to return this from the but it needs some additional class customlabel public string trackingreference private public string customtext private public string trackingreference customtext means my factory method has to class public ilabel string string switch case return new case return new case return new like this because the factory now needs to cater for the lowest common but at the same time the customlabel class to get a custom text i could provide the additional factory method as an but i want to enforce the fact that the customlabel needs the otherwise only ever be given empty is the correct way to implement this class knows too

using generics to create a key for a say this is definitely not a good idea for a couple different first reason is that it violates the reasoning behind a dictionary a key should hold some significance to the value it why are you storing a string under what does does it mean the string is either true or confusion like this makes the code harder to also suspicious that the key value is used in casting the string somewhere else in this is clearly a of dictionaries and second reason is that the session is shared within a so two completely different segments of code written by two different developers are accessing this shared what is to stop one developer from identifying as an appropriate for data a in their and another using as a for data b in their now the first developer is expecting a when accessing this but gets a unique key would prevent this from

view structure is based on the not the model in the mvc you should have a view for each action public in a the controller actions have to match up directly to each table in database but there is likely some sort of direct relationship between the number of tables in the database and the number of controllers and controllers are higher level is standard to have crud type actions on the when they are list the items view a specific edit an new delete an of these actions will require a view sometimes more than you can collect a large number of views if it is a large the way to minimize the code shared functionality to partial as to keep the action views as small and simple as the views and controllers simple so that they are easy to ajax to implement more functionality in one important to point out that any large application is going to have lots of whether mvc or web if there is a lot of data to work there are going to be a lot of forms necessary to do

was wondering if it is possible to include svg content inside a panel whatever would work in be able to add more to the svg add a circle or a programmatically and handle mouse events this be in svg or tried creating an html object adding something along the lines work visible in but not sure if it was because i did it wrong or not was able to do a simple example in gwt with google linechart but like to move away from google visualization and be able to generate the svg myself and customize it looked around and many resources points to using canvas but not sure if the best route also a bit baffled about the example i tried a simple of it to try locally and it seem to work at i was however able to get another sample working with just htm with src pointing to svg l separate svg file but i been able to access it using gwt using read about svg not working with hosted browser and compiling it does work but i am uncertain how to refer to the svg i have placed into the html via if i can access it then presumably i can add to its tried in but that seem to work or did i mess guess the goal is to be able to manipulate a svg file which i linked somehow in gwt or in and be able to modify it based on been programming functionality inside of the actual svg in our our svg is an embedded object and we passed to the embedded passing information from an embed object to and from html is quite doable since the html has access to our svg functions and the svg has access to the are more transparent ways of doing so where firebug could see the svg directly which is nice but now not quite thus i think any of the solutions looked at were iframes but i could be a little svg can be pretty slow would say my issue is solved but not using nor gwt at the moment but the method i described in my answer should still work if i want to use svg in

well as the issues about being inferior to handling as a string is in itself a very unreliable way of might work better if every browser stuck to the scheme of identifying but they most browsers claim to be regardless of what they and that bit at the start is the only readily parsable part of the the rest is completely so scripts started searching the whole string for characterists substrings like this is a browsers deliberately spoof each including substrings like and in their user agent strings when not those mostly to defeat string browsers allow the entire user agent string to be spoofed under user browser variants for example ie mobile is nothing at all like regular but will still match browsers allow to write extra tokens to the user agent string including arbitrary just one registry change by a rogue can make msie look like matching is just inherently for example a new browser called would match

would be the best to find a programmer that has already designed some known framework for the language in your users think is irelevent i becuase you judge about framework by asking arbitrary programmer his toughts about his answer will depend upon his level of knowledge and personal methodologies while api is being designed for wider population am assuming this is your to finish this in my firm programmers that use think that is lame language becuase of like you write button in and let the compiler automatically find default property for you want such person judging your designers experienced in different languages may be of help because wider used apis should be implemented with the help of well known programming patterns people are already familar

wrote a blog post which has a sample project that you can download here code basically uses aes for encryption of binary data and then rsa encrypts the key and the iv using an as long as the private key certificate is the key and iv can be and then in turn the aes encrypted data can be decrypted could set up your certificate stores so that the only has access to the public key while the has access to the private allows you to encrypt using different key and iv each time and avoid hardcoding which i believe is more there should be nothing in your source code that would easily allow someone to decrypt your data and if your system was ever you would only need to swap out the certificates with new no need to recompile the application with new hardcoded sample code may be slightly different from your intended but i think the technique and some of the code might be useful to

wrote this answer back in when android was relatively and there were many not well established areas in android i have added a long addendum at the bottom of this addressing some and detailing a large philosophical disagreement i have with those who encourage the use of singletons rather than subclassing read it at your own more general problem you are encountering is how to save state across several activities and all parts of your a static variable a is a common java way of achieving i have found that a more elegant way in android is to associate your state with the application you each activity is also a which is information about its execution environment in the broadest your application also has a and android guarantees that it will exist as a single instance across your way to do this is to create your own subclass of and then specify that class in the application tag in your now android will automatically create an instance of that class and make it available for your entire you can access it from any using the method also provides a method which has the exact same myapp extends application private string public string return public void mystate blah extends activity public void myapp appstate string state has essentially the same effect as using a static variable or but integrates quite well into the existing android note that this will not work across processes your app be one of the rare ones that has multiple also as anticafe in order to correctly tie your application override to your application a tag is necessary in the manifest see the android docs for more an user608578 asks below how this works with managing native object i admit i am not up to speed on using native code with android in the and i am not qualified to answer how that would interact with my if someone does have an answer to i am willing to credit them and put the information in this post for maximum some people have this is a solution for something i perhaps should have emphasized more in the original this is not meant to be a solution for saving user or other information that is meant to be persisted across application i consider most criticism below related to applications being killed at any as anything that ever needed to be persisted to disk should not be stored through an application it is meant to be a solution for storing easily application state a user is logged in for and components which are single instance network manager for in has been kind enough to point out an interesting with reto meier and diane in which use of application subclasses is discouraged in favor of singleton somatik also pointed out something of this nature although i see it at the because of reto and roles in maintaining the android i cannot in good faith recommend ignoring their what they to a certain i do wish to disagree extremely strongly with the diane in expressed with regards to preferring singleton over application in my disagreement i will be making use of concepts best explained in stackexchange explanation of the singleton design so that i do not have to define terms in this i highly encourage skimming the link before point by states the is no reason to subclass from it is no different than making a this first claim is there are two main reasons for the application class provides a better lifetime guarantee for an application it is guaranteed to have the lifetime of the a singleton is not explicitly tied to the lifetime of the application it is this may be a for your average application but i would argue this is exactly the type of contract the android api should be and it provides much more flexibility to the android system as by minimizing the lifetime of associated the application class provides the application developer with a single instance holder for which is very different from a singleton holder of for a list of the see the singleton explanation link likely to be something you regret in the future as you find your application object becoming this big tangled mess of what should be independent application this is certainly not but this is not a reason for choosing singleton over application in fact it is telling to me that none of arguments provide a single reason that using a singleton is better than an application all she attempts to establish is that using a singleton is no worse than an application which i believe is also comments that using an application subclass is likely to be something you regret in the future as you find your application object becoming this big tangled mess of what should be independent application as before this is not but only further points out that there is no concrete benefit to using a singleton instead of an application subclass in this she this leads more naturally to how you should be managing these things initializing them on this ignores the fact that there is no reason you cannot initialize on demand using an application subclass as again there is no ends with framework itself has tons and tons of singletons for all the little shared data it maintains for the such as caches of loaded pools of it works i am not arguing that using singletons cannot work fine or are not a legitimate i am arguing that singletons do not provide as strong a contract with the android system as using an application and further that using singletons generally points to extremely inflexible which is not easily and leads to many problems down the the strong contract the android api offers to developer applications is one of the most appealing and pleasing aspects of programming with and helped lead to early developer adoption which drove the android platform to the success it has suggesting using singletons is implicitly moving away from a strong api and in my weakens the android that diane has not explained a single downside to using an application and has not proven that using a singleton is better in any i cannot agree with any of her it may be that she has not fully explained her but i cannot see any downside to using an application subclass which would counter the numerous downsides to i do not argue that singletons cannot work but i do argue that they are generally the product of either a bad api or a lazy i disagree quite strongly with which i feel is a terrible basis for an i leave you with the following list of downsides to as stolen from the stackexchange to use abstract or interface to coupling across the application to to test in unit to parallelize in the case of mutable state extensive add my and unmanageable lifetime contract unsuited for android most

you asking if you can find out before you call malloc how many bytes are available for you to the answer is even if you the answer may not be very valuable to the reason why is you can never know how much memory is you can only know how much memory this is a very important distinction because it has an affect on the way you can properly utilize an lets assume there was such a function called this code looks correct but is horribly size size no need to check the answer because there is enough p reason why is that some other thread could come in between the if statement and the malloc statement and do own that could reduce the overal memory in the system and hence change worse is the available amount of memory in the system does not determine how much memory can be allocated with important for malloc any other memory alloc is how much contiguous memory is

you know what the operation aborted error a microsoft kb article about also tonnes of posts about it but the simple answer for occurrence is the error only occurs if you try to manipulate a dom element via javascript before the element you are trying to manipulate is know how internet infamous operation aborted occurs and know how to fix the problem i have is a very weird testing locally and on a development machine with i never ever get the operation aborted error sites running as on our testing site it occurs all the unfortunately my testing environment is not the same as the testing so that adds some variables to the but the main difference i see is that the testing site is using anyone ever had the operation aborted error only for an ssl other thought that popped in my head was that it was a latency locally the site loads up almost instantaneously whereas on my testing the page loads so with that in i got fiddler running and simulated the performance to run at old school modem still no operation aborted error locally or on our own testing the site is an site using ajax extensions the page with the issue also has the ajax control cascading drop down on yes as far as i can tell all javascript that manipulates the dom is at the end of the not the help or comments is greatly operation aborted and latency

you need a collection of then an array may well be the best tool for the boxing is a comparatively expensive for a collection including of primitives that will be used as i almost always use an array to avoid repeated boxing and rarely worry about the performance difference between an array and an if a will provide more maintainable then i will always use a or as but your question was about unless there is some compelling reason not performance is that compelling almost always results in better in part because arrays play nice with as johannes already pointed out in a but also because of so many other have a very rich api and a large variety of implementations that can most be trivially swapped in and out for each collection can be trivially converted to an if use of an array version is collections grow more gracefully than an array which can be a performance work very well with arrays fairly tofubeer pointed array covariance is strange and can act in unexected ways that no object will act collections handle covariance in expected need to be manually sized to their and if an array is not full you need to keep track of that if an array needs to be you have to do that of this i rarely use arrays and only a little more often use an i do use very often just or my most frequent use of arrays is when the item being stored is a primitive and will be inserted and accessed and used as a if boxing and unboxing every become so fast that it becomes a trivial i may revisit this but it is more convenient to work with to store in the form in which it is always instead of

you release software builds to do you prefer to always use the or do you sometimes use the debug my like to use asserts to trap for conditions that should never the one it might be useful for to test our software with the assertions so that if they can create a scenario that triggers an they can report it to the other there is always the risk that a developer has coded an assertion in a way such that it changes the behavior of the in that should be testing the a build with assertions we have always had operating on our relesae as that was the code that would i am thinking about trying a pattern where our really early releases to would go out with assertions then as we get closer to we will notify them that their builds have assertions do you guys release builds vs debug and
