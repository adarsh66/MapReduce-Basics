a couple of issues going on when you are using sql notifying the workflow of events and having the workflow publish events is persistent and asynchronous and the underlying plumbing of the workflow is not in the way you might something horrible happens somewhere in the sequence of events that will eventually cause your workflow to transition to a new then the workflow will revert to the state it was in before attempting the activity this keeps the workflow in a consistent state since being is a bad a transaction scope as done above is but you have to remember that the only time transaction scopes actually work is when the classes within the using block are aware of the the transaction you can do is have your call to wrap things in a when something goes you can vote for a but this still the method on your you can give some specifics about what trying to accomplish at a higher there may be some things intrinsic to the wf that might better suit you than trying to shoehorn a transaction scope into the did some digging and found a couple of different places where we are told that is no api to manipulate the scheduler work unfortunately for us what this means is that any sort of rollback behavior that we want going to have to implement by hand on our i knew more about why you were trying to rollback work queued through an edes i might be able to suggest some potential architectures for accomplishing your task without the wheel times out of 10 when i run into problems like this where it looks like wf just support what trying to the problem is because either kept too much code the workflow or tried to put too much code it and refactoring where my work is done often fixes my problem without requiring me to write new

agree it should be kept simple but most of the scrum framework can be used had several people working in this fashion both on projects as well as on still an owner thats in charge of defining the business value and the backlog should still be part of a bigger scrum enterprise then he probably needs to feed on part of a bigger product team its either a 1 or so its really but thats daily yes between the 2 or if its just that 1 person at good time to go over tasks and think about what impediments need to be surfaced to the scrum of scrum or to the product still a good especially if part of a larger scrum enterprise thats working in but even without good chance to catch up with demo what you energize retrospect and see what you can do plan for the next that in case of working outside of a scrum enterprise scrum of sprints can benefit from being shorter than usual since the scope is probably smaller and the planning overhead but it depends on the it can be held i think killer programmers need to retrospect on their own and take action on things that hold them even keep a chart in your workspace to help you with making board burndown you need you can have them in your work space on the they can be but they really help even if one can gtd things help a single person and a if that person is doing project work then a sprint burndown and release burndown provide a lot of if doing work its still a way to verify on track or and apply relevant measures master the person should be his own scrum if the organization had a coach helping the then he should also help this scrum sum up its clear to me that the values and principles underlying apply for person teams as also clear that most of scrum can be applied as questions is what the individuals involved the the the po are all on board and believe that the make and strive to it will they then first get to the point where the overall thinking makes then deal with the individual

agree with other posters here that you should look carefully into schema but i also know that shortcuts are part of a sample function written in sybase dialect that does what you function in in local temporary table tmp 0 while 0 loop over list and stuff members into temp if locate 0 set locate set substring insert into tmp thisitem values set stuff insert into tmp thisitem values set end end loop exists from tmp where thisitem set set 0 if return can then build a simple query to check whether a value occurs in your from t where 1

agree you want to lock display modal in the gui when the concurrency i think can be really frustrating for a user when they know why it is think keeping the gui responsive if there was no and then when a conflict is when you receive the response from your other you correct the i like the effect to let the user know that their operation has been perhaps with status bar similar unobtrusive message to explain the reverted you can add some messaging when operations you could provide some additional feed back in an unobtrusive that there is a potential for conflict with another

all of the formatted extraction operations of skip over whitespace extracting an item are you sure you want to part ways with this then you could probably achieve what you want by deriving a new from and overriding each to call the following method at the char skips over whitespace to read a if not at end of file and no errors quite a bit of leaving out a few details here as the fact that a more general solution would be to override the class template

all the letters upper or lower this the only alphabet want to are you doing this so lines of do this outside the inside the just 1 advantage of the above is that you can do it without having to sort the list the list is you can use bisection to get there on a simple alphabet is there much in topos i in say forever with trypos print if topos frompos if if print print code requires fewer so is by far the better scaling version but may still be slower when executed via a python interpreter because it goes via python instead of operations written in to and kylotan for their

alters the orientation of the entire element you declare it not the text content inside more like property than transforming an element change how its content size is calculated how its layout is affected by that algorithms for vertical and horizontal sizing are different and difficult enough to get right to being no real consistent way they could accomodate content with arbitrary so is like using it changes where the content is but not anything to do with layout if you want to include one in a table need to set the explicitly to accomodate the expected rotated if you know that in advance you could potentially hack it up with for me on the span is also rotated like the however on windows with its the rendering look a image could come out considerably

am currently developing on an advertising which have been running just fine for a while apart from recently when our views per day have shot up from about 7k to our server cannot take the pressure on this anymore and knowing that i am not the best sql guy around i can make it but not always in the best i am asking here for some optimization i hope that some of you will be able to give rough ideas on how to improve this i specifically need just to see the light it is at the when an advert is supposed to be shown a php script is which in return calls a stored this stored procedure does several it tests up against our customer database to see if the person showing the advert by a primary key is an actual customer under the given locale system is running on several languages which are all run as separate next up is all the advert details fetched out location as an height and width of the and lest step calls a separate stored procedure to test if the advert is allowed to be shown the campaign expired by either date or number of adverts allowed to and if the customer has access to it got 2 access systems a blacklist and a whitelist and lastly what type of campaign is the view unique and so code consists of a couple of stored procedures that i will post in procedure called from procedure bit bigint int int set nocount declare declare declare declare declare declare declare select must be valid ie exist and actually be a if select return must be a valid exec fetchadvertdetails if select return end exec canaddstattoadvert if begin insert into values function declare declare set from where customerid and deleted 0 and isapproved 1 and isblocked 0 and localeid if set set return fetch advert procedure int int set nocount on added to prevent extra result sets interfering with select set nocount select from advert as inner join campaign as t2 on where and and 0 and if is return return procedure type of stat to bit bit bit money money smallint bigint set nocount declare declare declare declare declare declare select select select select select campaignid from where id if is select select moderationtype from where id if 0 and 2 and or 0 or and if not a click or view then type must match the campaign only able to do leads on lead no isales or click and view campaigns however can do leads select take advantage of the fact that the variable only gets touched if there is a which is supposed to override the existing if there is select earning from where canpaignid and publisherid if select if not is select advertsleft from where id if select if 0 select from where campaignid and publisherid and if select else select from where campaignid and publisherid and if select if select if from as inner join as on where and and and and and 0 select select 1 not and set status to be ip if 0 and 0 and select if select if 0 or select am thinking this needs more than just a couple of indexes thrown in to help but rather a total rethinking of how to handle i have been heard that running this as a batch would but i am not sure how to get this and really not sure if i can implement it in a such way where i keep all these nice checks before the actual insert or if i have to give up on some of all help would be if you need any of the table let me know for taking the time to look at it optimization on advertising

am pretty new to mvc and i am trying to get my head around some of the design concepts at the one thing i am currently stuck on is how to handle a situation such as that described i have a page that needs to render a number of for on the left hand side there is a list that is data driven and then the selected item in the list displays a further list in another section on the for better understanding lets suggest the left hand list is a list of movie categories and the other list displays a list of movies that are contained within that along with the various movie i have some form of orm such as entity linq to sql or whatever that maps the tblcategory and tblmovie database tables into category and movie entities these entities live in the i then use a repository pattern located in the namespace to encapsulate the queries against these entities to return our model is where my first question should the repository be returning view model entities or domain entities which are then extended to produce view model in my naive mind i see the entities returned from the orm as simply containers for the data with domain entities containing the business so surely there should be an abstration back to my now lets assume i wish to present the two sections described at the beginning of i am assuming that what should be happening here is my domain entity model would contain a list of categories and their associated so something like a list each of which contains a model would have been populated this is my second say my assumption above is correct and it is simply data entities are returned from the now i have a called the with some domain entities such as the movie and category entities mentioned in the previous do these entities have methods on them to retrieve the data from the orm and populate or does the repository retrieve these populated entity and another question on this if i have a movie and customer entity in my orm is it acceptable to be having domain entities named the i assume the controller now has this populated list of category and movie objects and passes it back to the i am guessing it is best to have each of the sections described at the beginning as partial views and passing the populated model to it may be the indexcontroller which retrieves the populated categorymovies passing this to the categories partial view and the movies partial i would then need to somehow determine the selected category and display the appropriate list of movies in that category within the so if anyone has got to this point in my ramblings i will take a deep i hope i have explained my mixed up thoughts and questions in sufficient detail for someone to provide some kind of for partial models and

am writing a library in in which i have among a class originally written in but converted into i know much about so therefore i have used online to now i am stuck with some code which i believe the was not able to running the code i get the following was at really understand the reason for this i believe this error might be due to the fact that is able to automatically convert an integer variable into a string needs the or due to the fact is using an incremental operator which is not supported by is the original in where is a void string the primary character if int idx while code original code works when using a created in is the converted code in which gives me the error mentioned sub primarycharacter as byval alternatecharacter as the primary character if 0 dim idx as integer while idx primarycharacter idx end end if code original code may be found should say that the code in the class is quite advanced for me a hobby programmer but learning every so maybe i see obvious things but this is the reason why i am asking you please give me any hints to sort out this is the complete sub in appends a metaphone character to the and a possibly different metaphone keys for the primary character to append to primary if no alternate char is the alternate key as alternate character to append to alternate may be null or a in which case the primary character will be appended to the alternate key private void string the primary character if int idx while the alternate character if character was if it is not append the primary string as long as it zero length and a space if if int idx while but if the primary character is add that if 0 int idx while else if no alternate character was but a primary so append the primary character to the alternate int idx while unable to convert code from to due to incremental operator or automatic string conversion

an explanation in laymans assume you want to fill up a library of and not just stuff them in but you want to be able to easily find them again when you need you decide that if the person that wants to read a book knows the title of the and the exact title to then all it should with the the with the aid of the should be able to go find the book easily and how can you do obviously you can keep some kind of list of where you put each but then you have the same problem as searching the you need to search the the list would be and easier to but you want to search sequentially from one end of the library to the want something with the title of the can give you the right spot at so all you have to do is just stroll over to the right and pick up the how can that be with a bit of forethought when you fill up the and a lot of work when you fill up the of just starting to fill up the library from one end to the you devise a clever little you take the title of the run it through a small computer which spits out a shelf number and a slot number on that this is where you place the beauty of this program is that later when a person comes back in to read the you feed the title through the program once and get back the same shelf number and slot number that you were originally and this is where the book is as others have already is called a hash algorithm or hash and usually works by taking the data fed into it title of the book in this and calculates a number from say that it just converts each letter and symbol into a and sums them all in reality a lot more complicated than but leave it at that for beauty of such an algorithm is that if you feed the same input into it again and it will keep spitting out the same number each so basically how a hash table stuff the size of the the output of such a hash algorithm is inside a range of some large typically much much larger than the space you have in your for say that we have room for exactly one million books in the the output of the hash calculation could be in the range of 0 to one a lot what do we we use something called modulus which basically says that if you counted to the number you wanted the one billion but wanted to stay inside a much smaller each time you hit the limit of that smaller you started back at but you have to keep track of how far in the big sequence that the output of the hash algorithm is in the range of 0 to and you get the value 17 from a particular if the size of the library is only 7 you count and when you get to you start back at since we need to count 17 we have and the final number is course modulus calculation done like done with and the remainder of dividing 17 by 7 is 3 goes 2 times into to and the difference between 17 and 14 is you put the book in slot leads to the next since the algorithm has no way to space out the books so that they fill the library exactly the hash table if you it will invariably end up calculating a number that has been used in the library when you get to the shelf and the slot number you wish to put a book already a book collision handling methods including running the data into yet another calculation to get another spot in the or simply to find a space close to the one you were given right next to the previous this would mean that you have some digging to do when you try to find the book but still better than simply starting at one end of the at some you might want to put more books into the library than the library in other you need to build a bigger since the exact spot in the library was calculated using the and size of the it goes to follow that if you resize the you might end up having to find new spots for all the since the calculation done to find their spots has hope this explanation was a bit more down to earth than buckets and functions

are many differences between how an actual processor handles timing and how a simulation of the processor can handle there is no one way that actual processors deal with you say it is a simple and primitive you need not worry about out of order branch etc it would be good to learn about can simply set the clock interval equal to the interval of the longest you could club all the shorter instructions in one find the longest in the that and set the clock interval to that the remaining long instructions can be allocated an interval which is equal to a multiple of the clock there is no one way to go about

are three advantages of splitting time between projects that cannot be doing or consulting on work that requires similar specialised knowledge in both and knowledge bringing consistency into the way two separate products are built and spreading knowledge accross the team on a rare occasion when one of the projects is temporarily on hold waiting for some further time between several projects is beneficial when it does not involve a significant change in a developer to work on multiple software development projects negates the benefit of specialisation any in the consistency and knowledge leaves just the advantage of time however if contexts differ significantly and there is no considerable overlap between projects the overhead of switching will very likely exceed any time switching is a very interesting contrary to its name implying a discreet change the process is always there are various degrees of having context information in context it takes less time to as opposed to however there is a direct correlation between the amount of context loaded on the and output possible to fill your time entirely working on multiple distinct projects relying on reduce the lead but the output quality will inevitably at some point not only aspects of quality that will but also functional failing to accomplish its functional

are two separate problems do you maintain local forks of remote do you keep a copy of remote projects in your own 1 is pretty easy by just do something clone remote add upstream remote rm remote add origin push can then work on your forked repository when you want to merge in upstream pull upstream for problem one option is to use for cd into your main and submodule add i use git what do i need to may find git submodules to be a little bit tricky at here are some things to keep in commit the submodule before committing the push the submodule before pushing the sure that the head points to a branch before committing to a bash i recommend using to put the current branch name in your run submodule after switching branches or pulling can work around to a certain extent by using an alias created by one of my config pull git submodule update then git submodules are so what are the can check out the main project without checking out the this is useful when the submodules are and you need them on certain you have experienced git possible to have multiple forks of your and link them with different forks of your main somebody might actually fix git submodules to work more the deepest parts of the submodule implementation are actually quite just the tools that are submodules for what you want to use git you might want to look into subtree this keeps everything in one if the upstream repository uses is pretty easy if you know how to use git svn clone remote add origin push set up a local tracking branch in push origin checkout to merge from svn merge tested this but how we maintain one submodule with an upstream svn use git svn because it will make it very difficult to use git submodule in the parent project without losing just treat the subversion branches as mirrors of and merge from them you need to access the upstream subversion repository on another svn init svn should then be able to merge changes from upstream as

as much a learning exercise as anything then take an iterative build build my rough guideline with the structure of a website and concentrate on the notepad and build a bunch of static pages for your hand code try to build all your pages with no table then play around with some javascript to bring things to calendar learn about how to import and link to javascript and css and how these files are treated to learn up to the limits of what you can do on the client factor in the nuances of browsers and client side start looking for what you might want to change across what needs to be manipulated server and pick a server side with basic forget databases at this learn how your framework of choice maintains not just the name of the technology but the real nuts and bolts of one of your single greatest assets as a web developer is understanding the state of the technology go for a deep dive on the web server technology of choice in understand the full request pipeline from client to server and this will teach you http and its web filters and server to framework hand page and control life back to the start working on dynamic content injection and the how to make and use reusable components in your web performance and get into into all the fun stuff like replace your javascript with you got the whole side of things to the web for client side going to the sites of companies who make third party web controls can be quite asking how the hell they did viewsource is your look at how they structure and build their pick a couple of good web designer and you find a plethora of rants about browser wars etc that will give you good the you hit server go for white paper type learning from your vendor of choice for your again find a 3rd party site used to use a lot of guys from for that will demonstrate how to do various language learning is basically just do the best you can till you find a better and always be on the lookout for a better

assuming a lot about his the tutorial is written for people who know java web app at least to some basic and have dealt with a little perhaps even tried a jquery tutorial or i think this is as it means that someone who familiar with all of that will be able to jump right in and get to the meat of the matter without having to filter out all the stuff they already perhaps a paragraph at the top explaining those assumptions would be a good but i jumps out at me as a potential gotcha is that the weather servlet is in the ajaxify you will need to make sure you specify that package in or change it to match what you are no mention is made of including the file in the of your you will need to include code around the form to make it into a complete html so you will have a element into which to put the various you will also need to complete the class as in any other java web class weatherservlet extends i think a great i am familiar with servlets and know the concept behind knew of and have messed with jquery for about ten the tutorial perfectly filled the gaps in my knowledge i had around how all those pieces fit i had no idea jquery could make ajax so easy to deal and this is going to get me to look a lot more seriously into

company maintains two svn repository 1 and repository repository has multiple projects in and is only accessed by the developers within the access is through https and authentication is through the windows repository has a single project in and is accessed by the developers within the and our access is through and authentication is through the passwd have some code in a folder in repository 1 that we would like to be downloaded to users of repository the obvious answer is to use svn but as far as i can that would need the developers to have accounts on our and our it people like the only solution i can see is some kind of cron job that runs periodically to copy the necessary files from repository 1 to found a tool called which claims to do what i but so far not managed to get it to work i spend more time trying to get tailor to does anyone have any suggestions of another my last resort is to knock up a program to do it for which be too but always best to use an existing app if there is in advance for any copy revisions from one svn repository to another active svn	
compilation error how is defined public return seqi e works	
compiler is doing its best to be helpful you need to define a method with the following need to define a copy constructor for types that you store in a what this error message is trying to you should also implement the operator so that the following is x x if x y then y x if x y then x y y x if x y and y z then x z many of the types will provide these for which is why some people know what you have to do to store custom objects in and other stl

complexity is just one variable that impacts the overall performance of a other factors might include network latency or network especially when the size of the returned data is you run the same algorithm on a local you will get the results faster than if you run the algorithm on a machine on another continent and need the same results sent over the factors might include raw cpu speed if the calls are done on physically different why premature optimisation is the root of all say it depends even more now on the details of the what database software you are or whether or not your web service is reading data from a static web page or dynamically generating the i am beginning to lose sight of why you are asking the you seem to say that both methods take the same amount of so if they take the same amount of how can you ask which is clearly they are equally you need to tell us more about how and when they stop taking the same amount of	
computation time is not important why not go the whole 128 is there any real reason to choose 64 bits beside possible storage then an extra 8 bytes is not going to kill you with storage so bits vs 128 bits will cause no speed problems in not certain about	
compute sounds like exactly what looking you can sign up for one or more virtual machines to 20 more if you starting at an hour per plus bandwidth costs between ec 2 machines and web you can choose between several operating systems linux windows if you pay and you can use machine images or create your if using all software and have much bandwidth it sounds like it would cost you around to run your job that your 6 years of compute time was for something comparable to their small with a single virtual you sign up for the service and get set pretty easy to get new virtual machines even spent the to launch a machine for a few minutes just to verify an answer i was giving someone here on i wanted to check something on so i just booted up an instance and had a solaris vm at my disposal within 5	
concentrating my answer on trying to avoid this leads to two the people using the system will therefore be actively trying to contravene your check and your goal is only to detect the presence of a not to extract the complete this solution would look different if your goal is something think your best bet is going to be with the there are the cctlds and the comparitively small list of these need to be prefixed by a dot and suffixed by either a slash or some word as others have this going to be no way to get without disallowing the legitimate tried it or all of that this would be my this will will of course break as soon as people start obfuscating their replacing with dot again assuming spammers are your goal if they start doing that sort of their rates are going to drop another couple of orders of magnitude toward the set of people informed enough to deobfuscate a url and the set of people uninformed enough to visit spam sites i a miniscule this solution should let you detect all urls that are to the address whilst keeping collateral damage to a bare	
considered it because of the relatively large overhead involved with packaging and unpacking a message and a web service with a web method called that takes two the caller packages up two integers and receive a single integer in where really only 96 bits of information being the addition of the soap packets will probably add around or more extra bits in each a 30x to this is the relatively slow performance associated with serializing and deserializing the message into admittedly pretty fast these but certainly not

do writing your own crypto system can easily lead to making best to use an existing or if get someone who knows cryptography to do if you have to do it read already have enough insecure do things correct and worry about performance if you are stuck on using aes to roll your here are a few is a block given a key and a block of it converts it to a specific the problem with this is that the same blocks of data will generate the same ciphertext with the same every so suppose you send data like two separate and the userroles encryption will have the same ciphertext each regardless of the all i need is the ciphertext for an and i can drop it right in with my there are operation the main idea is that take the ciphertext of one and xor it into the ciphertext of the next that way do and the username ciphertext is affected by the problem is that the first block is still vulnerable just by seeing i might know their enter the the iv the cipher and ensures it has random data to encrypt the rest of the so now the userroles ciphertext has the ciphertext of the random iv problem make sure you generate a random iv for each the iv is not sensitive and can be sent plaintext with the use an iv large enough the size of the block should be fine for many provide integrity anyone can modify your and the decrypt will still unlikely be data in but it might be hard to know what valid data for if transmitting a guid be easy to modify some bits and generate a completely different that could lead to application errors and so fix there is to run a hash algorithm sha256 or on the and include that in the data you so if my message is send now if someone tampers with the ciphertext by flipping a the hash will no longer compute and you can reject the you need to generate a key from a use the this provides salting and which can improve the strength of derived keys and reduce the chance of discovering the password if the key is sorry for not mentioning this earlier you also need to make sure you have an if you simply encrypt the message and pass it anyone who gets the message can just resend to avoid you should add a timestamp to the if the timestamp is different by a certain reject the you may also want to include a id with it could be the and reject messages that come from other ips using the same important to make sure you do the hash verification when you include the timing someone could tamper with a bit of the ciphertext and potentially generate a valid timestamp if you detect such brute force apparently using an iv correctly is controversial for some some code generate random ivs and add them to your output for also perform the authentication making sure the encrypted data aesdemo const int encryption with random iv to and includes hash of plaintext for public static construct message with var msg new var hash using aes using enc var encbytes prepend iv to var res new return public static using aes var iv new probably could copy right to the byte but not using dec var decbytes verify var hash var existinghash new if throw new hash hash is var res new return static bool if return for i i if return return static aes salt may not be needed if password is if throw new must be at least 8 if throw new must be at least 8 var pdb new var key var aes return static int int using sha return public static void var password var salt new 0 var ct1 var ct2 var pt1 var pt2 now check try tamper detection catch tampering performact1 performact2 tampering message hash 46 at removing the random iv and the the type of how the first corresponding to is the without a simple example of passing a just encrypt and open to in the attack is easily even with cbc static void var buff new new var v var aes var encbytes var dec for i i for x x try catch 6598637501946607785 if the kind of id it could quite easily be changed to another you need to authenticate outside of your the message structure is unlikely to fall into place and can sorta act as a but why rely on something that could possibly you need to be able to rely on your crypto working correctly regardless of the

do you want to do are you running into performance or do you want to prevent other connections from seeing data until you commit it to syncing to there is a tradeoff between database integrity and which you want depends on your high reliability and once you start a no one else can write to the database until you or this is usually the best if you have a lot of work to do at begin a write everything you then all your changes will be cached in ram until you at which time the database will explicitly sync to high speed and the database is no longer safe against power loss and program can lose your entire database with these they avoid explicitly syncing to disk as your changes to an and manually sync when you high speed and and another program can write to the database without you knowing about by writing to an you never need to sync to disk until you want other programs can write to the database and if not careful you can overwrite those this option is probably too complicated to be worth

does quality assurance fit into the design phase of software quality assurance activities are done in the design assurance in the design	
does the but you should keep in mind that does guarantee uniqueness if you have multiple processes running phusion multiple or a because you might get this sequence of events order is a gets a request to create a new user with the name b does the same a validates the uniqueness of by asking the db if that name exists yet and the db says the name exist b does the same thing and gets the same a submits the statement for the new record and you have a database constraint requiring uniqueness for that process b will submit the statement for the new record and with a ugly server exception that comes back from the sql if you do not have a database the insert will succeed and you now have two rows with as the also and in the rails on rails 3rd its really guarantee that column values will be all it can do is verify that no column has the same value as that in the record being validated at the time the validation is possible for two records to be created at the same each with the same value for a column that should be and for both records to pass the most reliable way to enforce uniqueness is with a also with way this commonly happens is accidental from a web page when creating a new this is a hard one to solve because what the user will get back is the second error and it will make them think their registration when in reality it the best way found to prevent this is just to use javascript to try to prevent

exactly how i handled search for i used multiple one per for the i simply had another which included everything from all indexes so when i added docs to the i added them once to the appropriate and once to the zend lucene is severely underfeatured compared to other lucene so this was the best solution i find that port supports only a subset of the lucene query and poorly even on moderate indexes queries as simple as or quoted phrases fail to perform adequately at we brought a large site onto our we discovered that zend lucene our index reached roughly and simple queries took up to 15 some queries took a minute or and building the index from scratch took about 20 switched to solr not only performs 50x faster during and 1000x faster for many queries queries finish in all finish in far more we were able to rebuild our document index from scratch in 30 minutes from 20 in one solr index with a i run multiple queries against the index for each each one with a different filter and one without a for the you plan on growing your index to you receive at least a few search requests per or you want to offer any sort of advanced search i strongly recommend abandoning

few although i think any of them will help main thing is that painting off of the awt override and instead call on the this can cause all sorts of problems recreate colors every this may or may not be one of those things that you want to i think though that having a constant for your colors is likely to screw up gcing and will make things easier to keep straight when you want to reuse colors redraw the entire window every you just need to repaint the sections that need to draw the set the background color and let the parent take care of a design the bodies should be in charge of drawing their owner should notify them that they need to be drawn rather than drawing bodies recreate their state every consider having them store it between times and mutate them as you may be spending a lot of time doing trig calculations in the to consider is setting up a timer rather than using a sleep in a while this will get you a more consistent frame but you need to make sure that you can actually meet your obligations coalesce multiple frames into one if you miss a or end up creating too many using a to do the then update the state in the finishing by calling are just a few you should experiment to see what works and what been a while since done java graphics

frequently frustrated by the amount of logging i have to include in my code and it leads me to wonder if a better way of doing know if this has been done or if someone has come up with a better idea but i was wondering is there a way anyone knows of to a logger into an application such that it passively monitors the thread and quietly logs processes as they occur without having to do things void string object process myprocess with int d returned value catch exception occurred during process would be great is if i could say to my would then monitor everything that goes on inside of that method including passed in arguments along with method calls and values passed into those exceptions that occur anyone implemented something like this in the could it even is logging in this fashion just a pipe love to design something that would do but i just even know where of i want to reinvent the wheel if already been it would be great if someone could point me in the right suggestions would be gratefully i thought comment on an answer which queried as to the level of detail required in the it is frequently required that configurable levels of logging be provided such that if the configuration specifies detailed logging then everything is whereas if critical logging is configured then only certain information is logged along with if fatal logging is configured then only information which causes the application to die would be would something like this be configurable or would aop require 3 or 4 different builds depending on the number of logging frequently use 4 passive logging possible in

going to have to give us some more detail about the exact structure of your data and filters to really be able to help you are the filters being used to select a subset of or to modify the what are the filters there are a few general less is there some way you can limit the amount of data working some that can run quickly and cut it down before you do your main out of the inner loop as soon as if one of the filters rejects a then break out of the inner loop and move on to the next if this is then you should also try to make the most selective filters come is assuming that your filters are being used to reject items out of the rather than modify for in the computation the filters if each of them performs some complicated calculations that share some then perhaps or may be used to avoid redundant it all boils down to the first less at all three levels of your can you do less work by limiting the items in the outer do less work by stopping after a particular filter and doing the most selective filters do less work by not doing any redundant computation inside of each

got a which is basically the queue in the which takes an queue item off the which is an action execution block off the queue and then calls a method to execute the actionlist within the queue can kill the queue easily enough by enqueing a null actionblock and block the main thread by doing a with a until the queue count goes to and all the threads fall through the while thereby but the method executing the last actionlist may still be executing the last is their anyway to detect if that method still has a thread executing like maybe using a semaphore or counter with an interlock to count the semaphore up at the beginning of the method and count it down at the so if it reaches them i know its not is the implementing a destroy method on the to close it down before calling to detect if a threaded method has

guess a variant of the my kids to language little context is in at my father is going to retire pretty soon soon enough that i need to start caring about that he is a very active person and looking for occupations for his future free and one of these could be while he is a history he is more than capable of as he was a early adopter of personal computing back when programming a computer was part of its normal on the apple he programmed in basic little programs while entertaining for me i was could not really be called and later on he taught me programming on this same apple i was only obviously my own starting applesoft which is also what he already is no longer relevant in this day and and not going to start by teaching him what working c too while not strictly speaking a better he restarts programming using one of these newfangled languages i keep hearing about thing i know none of so i thought ask what is the best language for that going to teach myself that then teach it to so the availability of online teaching while is not a it would be best for the language to make have as few strange idiosyncrasies or historical arctifacts as it should be obvious as much as i would start with then move to gui someone who has programmed line basic on an apple does not need a fancy popularity of the besides being is not a big available to platform functionality would be good error diagnostics and debugging is a while leisure is the main this would be put to use for specialised light at least at the the and of a new language is something that will be interesting for me to learn as since be investing time in though more of a side these are mostly soft i do have one hard and fast it needs to run on mac os this is what would you right now leaning towards in thank you all for your now going to install and try out the two winning python and java as well as a smalltalk after having investigated i will make my choice go ahead on the project with that add a bounty to this question amount of which will depend on my reputation at that and instanty accept the answer which proposed that choice can obviously not put the bounty as take me more than a week to unless the choice is smalltalk with in which case put an answer for it and accept it a wise you cannot add an answer for smalltalk with squeak and hope to get the since have put this answer after i decided to invest my time in the least i can not a problem that i have a single definitive choice from this i had intended to try out a few languages before making a choice and this question was very useful in coming up with a in all answers were useful in helping me clarify criterion and making me think about the so thank you all programming language to teach my	
guess that this error is actually coming from the stored procedure calling whatever using for in the proc is the it sounds like instead of doing something like doing a and complaining that it convert one of the values of cityname to an integer to compare it with used incompatible types on purpose just to get my point across which is does runtime even bother to try to convert a value from one incompatible type to since the fact that user assigned string to variable of type suggests that it is most likely a bug and not something user did

had similar problem with much more tables we can indeed avoid making cursor for each rows to be the only cursor is for looping the list of the table names we are also going to need dynamic sql for the whole operation is extremely compared to the traditional cursor loop trick is to insert the relevant rows into the same and then update its fk column to its how we can collect the mass is by making use of keyword during the and save them into a temporary table later we join with the tables involved for updating the their know table tbl id refid invoicedetail into price from invoicedetail custid 808 denormalized original populate temporary table with a list of newly created auto running our job is just to make this insert query as only drawback of this method is that we need on each table we must key of its own by the name of in this case we need to to become to become and a new column int primary in denormalized for tables listed with the table will require the current front end application to populate this new helper an will make our work a bit more column called defined int this column is for making the relationship of rows belong to as a copy of list all table names into table tbl sysname primary fktbl fkcol depth select select select love to go abstract as to just populating column during insertion and dynamically populate the rest of the columns by updating them with the result of recursive cte of however that could be beside the assume we have a table with the list of table names ordered by the way it should be loop the table in a int 808 original custid to copy tbl from where fktbl is dbcursor cursor local for select depth from order by dbcursor next from dbcursor into 0 set case when 0 then else end as set set set into from where print remap if third level set set from join as rf on and where as print if 0 select id from fetch next from dbcursor into from order by from table the content of function declare set select from where and non return am sure we can further improve these scripts to be far more but for the sake of solving the this would be the minimum

hard to give a single all encompassing answer but the high level approach is at this is the approach prioritize your goals and then try to identify the costs of reaching those your costs will essentially boil down to you want whatever is working to keep if you have something that is and there is no good reason to rewrite keep some of your existing code needs updating to do its then you are looking at maintenance at this point you need to determine if a rewrite will improve maintenance costs enough to be worth forget to subtract testing and debugging of new bugs because there will be new dismiss working code just because it is your existing code is sufficiently you can usually chip away at it one piece at a rewrite the high maintenance components you will be doing new development in then you should be fine working with com components until you have enough justification to replace

have a large sql server table that looks something like table stores an entry for each page of a number of image this is done to enable the table to represent images where each page is represented by a different and image files that contain the pages within the same when i am dealing with a the value of the fspath column is exactly duplicated for each page within the same document which is eating up a lot of space table alone is currently it seems very wasteful to be duplicating the data in this but i been able to find an alternate solution that satisfied usage pattern for this table is dominated by lookups based on the primary key for the path other but i also need to be able to efficiently handle insertion of new data and occasional i create a lookup table for the path elements and insert an path element id into the pages table i would need to index it both by the id and by the which would hurt the scenario where there is a distinct path piece for each and complicate the insertion of new data where the path may or may not exist in the lookup deletion of any row in the main pages table would require that i clean up the associated path entry if it is no longer had been hoping that i could create an updateable view of the joined tables and let sql server do the magic for but i get the view or function is not updatable because the modification affects multiple base trying to perform an there a reasonable way to do this that just or am i out of with duplicated data in sql

have a on a webpage which ends up with a calculated height property of this is not set in any cascading style inline or nor is it set in a i have searched everywhere in my code but the number 633 does not show up i can solve this by setting which is the height that i but ie seems to override this to the 633px that i would get in other browsers too by i have verified in both google chrome and that the actual contents of the div are nowhere near 633 pixels is there any way i can find out what the reason is for this calculated for here is what google chrome reports as the style properties of the style crossed in div in questions contains two one with one line of text in and a div with a height of so i figured out causing the second div that the main div contains one and a div floating over the right of that using internet explorer keeps the space where this element would have been any way around i wrapped the contents of the floating div with in a second div with that gets rid of the whitespace under the main image final html looks something like some floating out what the cause is of a certain calculated css

have a problem trying to solve with biztalk and was hoping you would have some thoughts on the best way to solve i am loading in a flat file using a flat file this file contains records if a number of different type 1 records are parent the rest of the types all link to the parent records using various foreign i am looking to develop a transform that will take the message created by loading the flat file records of all and transform that to a message which is the result of joining all the records based on the foreign each record in the resulting message would therefore have columns from all of the record types as the message records will be the result of a the flat file might contain the following message after the transform might contain records like type1 type2 type3 type4 type1 type2 type4 have been looking into the options for achieving this but was hoping some people might have advice on the way to i have tried splitting the original message into messages with records of each type then using a map to join them i had difficultly achieving this as i sure what functoids to inserting the child records into a sql database so that the additional columns in the parent records can be populated using sql lookup this was a bit slower than i would have hoped and has the additional dependency of using a using dts to load the transform it into the format and writing out a file in the joined format for biztalk to this is simple and fast but using advice on how to go forward to make the best use of biztalk for this would be biztalk 2006 to join	
have a program in which i want to be able to store certain data allocated on disk for reduced memory usage and first thought was to write my own custom allocator which managed the content of files on the but i want to see what alternatives there are looked into custom memory allocators and topics on object serialization but there are subtle both good and when adapting those principles to managing the address space of a this is accessed only through io functions rather than are only size of a file is not so it should grow when needed rather than being large and my it is acceptable to existing pointers after the data is not of a fixed most database implementations seem not well what is the best approach for this should i implement a simple memory allocator which treats a file as the im using on embedded implemented my own memory manager which uses buddy memory allocation and block sizes of powers of satisfied that it is correct and does not coalesces free and can do a the problem as there is quite a bit of internal and external not an expert in this field and although i find it fascinating still a i wonder if there are any other implementations that have done the same or similar surely i cant be the only helpful but so far incompatible topics i havent used mmap it addresses the file but not the management of the file address i have a reluctance to use boost libraries at the interesting but doesnt address variable size memory lea memory has very good insights into issues with memory but not in a position to try and make my own based dynamic memory

have a question not necessarily specific to any platform or api but more specific to interactions in code between game is a good say the player and a death animation that must finish before the object is this is typical for many cases where some animation has to finish before continuing with what ever action that would normally how would you go about doing question is about the control and logic of how would you design a system which is capable of driving the animation but at the same time implement custom problem that typically is that the game logic and animation data become that the animation has to callback into code or somehow contain meta data for duration of animation typically even more so a is when an which has to trigger some other say after spawn a custom this tend to result in deep nesting of code and a bomb with a timer would be en example of both logic and animation where both things but i want to keep them as separate as what would you do to keep animation and code two separate been trying out and a dsl might be the way to that would allow the animation or to express certain things in a presumably safe manner which would then go into the content and

have been down this road and here are all of the problems you are going to run this looks good for one but what happens when you need 4 other records to create that you end up creating 4 records to test inserting your one this causes all of the following creating and deleting records per test is it will slowly add up and running your tests will take 45 minutes me i was slow tests mean you will never run which means they will be broken most of the time and your delete will fail for some missed foreign key relation or dependency and then trash data will be left in your this trash data will then cause other tests to light of this i would implore you to consider two the first is to try out using an orm instead of writing all this logic then you only need to test your mapping files even less depending on the orm you or look into mocking so you can isolate the logic in your data access code from directly accessing the

how i approached this problem while maintaining a 10 year old legacy perl to give a slight bit of this was some of the worst of the i was initially depressed when i started working at the company because the code was so poorly thought out and laid out it was my first programming by the end of that gig i had a pretty good system of every new feature was added as a new module or nothing was hacked in on top of the existing this let me write unit tests for the new providing the confidence in so to integrate with the old stuff was just a matter of a line or any bugfix was implemented the same spend some time figuring out what was happening with the old stuff searching for the and write it out as a new method and wrap it in and then typically could however only works if got the and the to get it if you keep track of the time that you spend on any given especially where multiple bugs in the same or or at some point in easy to point at a given collection of code and say that this is so has cost n amount of time to was successful enough with this approach that i gained the honorary title also a fantastic skill to because more often than not the new job already has some code written

i believe in keeping things and rare it does that you need anything more than a good functional i think you should have some of the following use cases of the problems the software is trying to no less you should call out the problems the software is not trying to very basic ui oriented flow chart is sometimes by ui i mean it should take the perspective of the not the description of each of the including the types of input and what is done with the specs are sufficient to begin coding in joel wrote a article about this topic some time ago which you can read

i doubt that it is necessary to have hughe if statements if polymorphism is applied you need a proper domain model for your this goes somehow into the direction of the command depending on the complexitiy of your code maybe in combination with the state machine you have your defining rules is instantiate them could be done by having an xml which is parsed and transformed into your but the new modern and even more fancy way would be using if you program in java and have a certain freedom about your this would be a proper use case for dsls with basically you would need a builder which constructs your

i have a very odd using php part of though this also happens on a lamp server running as writing a web site using zend framework the software writing does a rather complicated statistical calculation that requires a lot of usually it runs fine with 128mb set as the memory the fun have a class which is exclusively responsible for getting the data it needs doing the calculations then returning the after it i have been unsetting as php seems to think that still in scope and holding up the memory for despite finishing the function in which it is called was causing problems where the second run of the calculation was hitting the memory limit and the script after this calculation is run once inside that it is run again in another function to do another calculation is during the same run of where things get i run that second the calling function runs despite the fact that there are absolutely no calls to that function from within the code which does this no errors or warnings appear in if i increase the memory limit to 1024 the overall calling function runs once and continues along its merry let me draw a map calls function calls function calls calculation function calls calculation function 128 mb of path of functions is as follows and back to the it runs a from the start of the for some to the end a conditional case which becomes true during this execution so the path 1gb of path of functions is as of which is what is supposed to i remove the second calculation from function it if i up the memory it have i found a bug in php memory or perhaps in the zend by increasing the memory limit per script in i see this or remove the second instance of running this calculation which uses a lot of very sure this is the way it despite the oddness of the way it does never seen this kind of jumping back to the start of a calling usually what would happen in this case is that php would error out and not restart the calling reaching memory limit causes function to

i think html and css are very and while the w3c certainly i think probably fair to say that a has been holding back design on the web more than the technologies has support for fantastic things such as web fonts with javascript engines are becoming increasingly speedy and allowing for things like john which would have been unimaginable years need to see users adopting new browsers at a faster and we need to see vendors getting behind efforts to encourage their users to think a mistake to think that abstractions are a negative and indicate some problem with the base technology technologies naturally evolve through some inconsistency in your post in the sense that you decry the need for but then mention that you desire consistency that consistency across clients is achieved through i no longer have to worry about how different clients handle the dom jquery does this for css hacks by the same token really and quite acceptable to serve a different stylesheet to the rendering difference between the other mainstream engines are pretty also consider that still using a lot of technologies to name a because they are elegant and well	
i think the awt code is correct but the rest is terribly cryptic that i understand but it express what you are actually doing very does reading your discussion on the other you are going to have a little is this concept of the awt everything done with the awt must be done on that so when the space bar is you will get that event on the awt you probably want to keep it though because as long as you hold onto it will prevent other graphics suggest looking at swingtimer set a swing timer to notify you every few and that notification will come in on the awt thread so that you can use it to click your then just exit and wait for the next timer they press space bar should work

implementing constraints that simply call a clr function for each constrained clr function is one or two lines of code that attempts to construct an instance of the data class associated with that for a class has a constructor which throws a meaningful error message when construction fails when the score is outside a valid what do you think of that for it centralizes my data types in making them available throughout my while also enforcing the same constraints within the so it prevents invalid manual edits in management studio that may try to working well so although updating the assembly causes constraints to be requiring a recheck of all constraints is perfectly i use checkconstraints with to make sure the data in all tables is still valid for enabled and disabled making corrections as until there are no then i the constraints on all the tables via table with check check constraint there a statement to with check all check constraints on all or do i have to them table by for the clr functions used in the check i can a in each function to catch data construction returning false on and true on so that the clr raise an error in the database out the just construct the instance and return allowing that aforementioned error message to be raised in the database prefer because my functions are simpler without the error and when someone using management studio makes an invalid column get the meaningful message from the clr like for type x match regular expression instead of some generic sql error like there any severe negative consequences of allowing clr errors through to sql or is it just like any other failure resulting from a constraint on implementing check constraints with sql clr

initializers are just fancy there is nothing the developer can do with them that he already do before they do however save you a few lines of by built in you mean extension methods this is nothing just better the methods are static methods that as if they were the build in classes remain typed variables are needed for i also use them with generics that have a lot of type but agree that i like to see them used course every feature can be abused but i think that these new features actually let you write code that is easier to	
initializers were something added to in order to simplify construction of objects when using an given 0 or more and are used to create and initialize an object the calling method gets the handle to the created for myobjectinstance new this the constructor of myobject will be run with the values param1 and these are both used to create the new myobject in the created object is setup using those gets and set to considered good practice to have a constructor require the parameters needed in order to completely setup an so that impossible to create an object in an invalid there are often properties that could be but are not this could be handled through overloaded but leads to having lots of constructors that necessarily useful in the majority of leads to object initializers an object initializer lets you set properties or fields on your object been but you can use it by anything for myobjectinstance new myproperty will behave exactly the same as if you do myobjectinstance new object initializers are simpler to read when you set multiple so they give you the same benefit as many overloads on the without the need to have many overloads complicating the api for that

is a very useful tool and i do often consider mastery of a mark of distinction just because it is such a crazy advice is learn another language too like python or scheme at the same i programmed for quite a long time but when i started learning scheme python and subsequently haskell a whole new world of thinking opened up to it is easy to get into the mind set that can do everything and do it faster so therefore there is no point in learning another the faster you can load the more concepts and methods of programming into your head the more awesome you will be at raw problem of the funnest quarters i had in college was a class that studied discrete math and functional programming with scheme which was immediately followed by a class that studied computer hardware architecture and used

is important to get as much information as possible about errors that are occurring back to the development log files are good in cases where there are no users to experice the error condition and you can be certain that someone is checking the log automatic email is great for server based alert messages are problematic because users never read one trick worked for me is to copy a detailed error trace on to the clipboard while a user friendly error is then train users to paste the error trace into an email error the web equivalent is to display a friendly message while sending a detailed error in an email to the development team from the should be a log of last in other what happens when writing to the log file causes an there should also be built in protection against type problems in which error handling itself locks the system on desktop sloppy error handling code can result in a never ending cascade of message boxes that leave no option but to kill the possibly losing data in the similar problems can result if error handling code triggers the error handling framework should detect error handling errors and stop reporting errors if there is no better vital batch nothing beats a proactive notification of if the email the user knows even if the error handling is should be caught at all event public component and service methods should catch all exceptions that in some an exception makes for when an exception is caught in a web service a soap exception should be but it is a bad idea to allow an excpetion to percolate across a component boundary it is usually a bad idea to catch exceptions on private methods of or in methods that are nested in the middle of a complex internal process of a it make sense to handle an exception in this context unless you can recover from the this internal code must be structured so that all resources will be released and database transactions rolled back in the presence of catch blocks in every method are the sign of using and finally blocks are a sign of a sound error handling that exceptions are exceptional you were expecting they be called rather than trying to anticipate when errors might concentrate on shoring up your component even trivial code that could not possibly experience an error should have a catch block if it sits on a that way when the code is modified later in unexpected ways the architecture will still component boundary may require a different reporting in the case of components that are design to run in different provide an error handling interface that client code can use to catch error forget the log of last resort if someone forgets to hook the error handling sum detailed error information the development team errors always at component only at component all code exception let the error handling part of the

is often the there seem to be one right answer for know what advantage there is to using the same element tag for the request and you for use and as separate that might be a bit more and would also strengthen the argument for using distinct namespaces for the two message if you have good reasons for using as the tag for both request and then you define a schema such that is a the union members would contain elements that are appropriate for either requests or but not this structure would make it easier to keep the two sides in the same if that seems like the right thing to be a little more inclined to go this route if i saw the request and response protocols as being tightly such that changes to one probably require changes to the other as if the types of information in the response set can change over time by then separate namespaces would make more

it is really a binary and you have actual binary data in it embedded then you need to be careful not to use any of the members that can treat it as a c string with a terminating as you will obviously end up losing class is not really appropriate for this purpose it is written on the assumption that what you are working with is actually a string of characters since you are using a blob or array of binary a is probably more insert the data will require you to bind the content of the vector to the sql query using bind that is to instead of using to execute a string containing the sql you should use to create the statement handle you leave the spot where the value of the binary value would go with a then use to bind the placeholder to the binary you then call the function using are some code examples in the documentation

just sudo like you need to setup passwordless sudo first in this can be done with visudo command for make sure you set up privileges in sudoers file in such way to constrain the apache user to that single command you wish to run your shell it poses a security because anyone could create a php script and run your shell script in so make sure that shell script itself is secure from alteration by apache second is even more you just allow apache to run killall with root you should wrap killall in another shell script and grant access to that in the do not run apache with root account and do not use both open a can of and since you are a newbie the question you you are very likely to miss some of small details that would create potential	
key piece of information in the question is percent we can shave off processing time saves us tens thousands of dollars per you need to consider much it will to shave each percent if that optimization effort costs tens of thousands of dollars per then it worth you could make a bigger saving by firing a the right skills today are rarer and therefore more you can assembler to get the fastest possible with slightly less rare you can do almost as well with some really c and so the more performance you squeeze out of the more it will cost you in development and there will be diminishing returns for ever greater if the profit from this stays at of thousands of dollars per then there will come a point where it is no longer worth the in fact i would hazard a guess already at that point because of thousands of dollars per is in the range of one and probably not enough to buy the skills required to a complex would guess that if you have code already written in the effort of rewriting it all as a direct translation in another language will be wasted it will very likely perform slower simply because you be taking advantage of the capabilities of the but instead working against trying to use java as if it was within your existing there will be parts that make a crucial contribution to the running time run and other parts that are totally irrelevant run so if you have some idea for speeding up the there is no economic sense in wasting time applying it to the parts of the program that affect the running use a profiler to find the hot and see where time is being wasted in the existing when i noticed the reference to the code being that if you focus your effort on removing bottlenecks so that your program can scale well over a large number of then it will automatically get faster every year at a rate that will dwarf any other optimization you can this time next quad cores will be standard on the year after 8 cores will be getting cheaper bought one over a year ago for a few thousand and i would predict that a 32 core machine will cost less than a developer by that

more info regarding the you have the viewstate and you set the text for the text is the one in the input this can affect you in the uncommon scenario when you are trying to know if a given value above is different for a since it an input with the viewstate if you set the text on every it will show the initial value it the viewstate is what automatically allows to keep the information accross postbacks for the as it happens with the it happens with your user if you change the setter so it sets both controls texts it will keep the value in the inner controls if you are using the if you turn it it would behave different for the label than for the that turning off the would also affect your visible i turn the viewstate off a but you might have an scenario where you really want to keep the controls information accross when turning off the you need to make sure to always configure the not only when that if you keep track of what is supposed to be visible and the text in your then you could turn off the inner viewstate you are not assigning any other property to are assigning the current value of the text property to the if you set the value in the current then it has its default thus you are getting the empty can save the value in the viewstate as string return this the only way to do if the toggle set the but you did it on the setter to both then they would keep the values long as you assign the text property of the user control after viewstate is being like in page

not advisable to try and optimize in the way you from the search algorithm article on half the the first test will be true so that there will be only one comparison of a and but the other half of the time it will be and a second comparison this is so grievous that some versions are recast so as not to make a second test at all thus not determining equality until the span has been reduced to and thereby foregoing the possibility of early termination remember that about half the time the search will happen on a matching value one iteration short of the is quite easy to make this problem still worse as in by using an order such a b then else if a b then else than detecting equality early it might appear this will force two comparisons to be performed for all but the last iteration of a like have a comparison that allows this step to be done with one comparison that branches to three different sections the tenth line of the comparison if your language support a test languages then two comparisons is the best you can advise you to check out the from the same the the

null works if the variable is actually if the variable is the empty string or an empty evaluates to this is somewhat so i would always suggest using returns true for empty empty boolean or so do use if you are sure you only want to do something if the variable is empty is generally better to check whether about to call a class method on something oh sometimes retrieving null from a database gives you the string which is not the same as an actual null it depends on the db using and how you saved the value to the database in the first this is very easy to miss and can take forever to figure try your subcat variable to see if it is string or literally a null this could account for unexpected behavior in your other code segment you mentioned in the

observed that message before but i think it was the same cause the not is a generic rpc error which can be caused by many our particular it was because we were hammering wmi too hard and not cleaning up our but it appears to be a different cause in your know you said you want to shorten the parameter but that may be the only way forward for having a hard time visualizing the circumstances under which you need to send 6m across an rpc perhaps if you explain the reasons behind we can help possibilities based on comments to the rpc calls limit the amount of data that travels across the this could be done by segmenting the message at the source and reconstructing it at the such as having three parameters could have the server dole out message identifiers in another rpc call or find some other way to ensure no two clients have the same a message identifier tying message segments a last flag begin the reconstruction a limited size segment xml is ripe for the 7zip libraries are the best seen in terms of size whether this would be fast enough is another fix by changing the out the registry area for the rpcmaxsize there are a couple of sites googled that suggest setting this to will remove size limitations so be fix while registering your can apparently achieve the same effect as on a specific interface with

of strings of binary digits to a number using python on the the docs for the i misread the you want to know what converting to binary gets that depends on what you mean by to say i want to store a file with a million the integers will be between 0 and if i were to store them as text it would take at best two bytes for each number digit number and a at worst six bytes digit number and a with an average size of bytes per number comment for the i also would have no easy way of choosing the 15th if i were store them as 16bit integers every number would take up exactly two bytes and i could find the 15th number by to offset and reading two when i go to do math on the text based version i my must first convert the string to a whereas the binary version is already a 16bit in you use binary types consistent record up programs

playing with this a and seeing the caveats with allocconsole and i think the best idea is to have two exe say and when you need console use of your code other than your main function can be placed into a project which produces a dll this includes all win including your main the only thing left in the exe project is a small main function which in turn calls a static function in your all of this can be done without resorting to your dll class public class private static bool misconsole private public static bool get return public static int bool misconsole do whatever main program return dos return catch if return dos return code indicating your project which emits a windows exe this is the only static class static int return your project which emits a console exe this is the only static class static int return in both exe you need a reference to the dll project in the same on the application tab of project you can change the project type windows app console app or class library that it is possible to programatically determine if an exe file uses the windows or console but it is probably not worth it lots of and you have to look at the bytes of the exe pe the methods are funny in that if you run your program from the command line or a batch and try to redirect the output to a it wil not work it will not go to the see possible to work but it requires more and probably not worth a best i never put more into an exe project than the simple main function that in turn calls a static function in a there are a lot of but one good reason is that unit testing tools work better with dlls than with also the form of the main function which takes a string array of and returns an this is the best form to because you can use errorlevel in batch files to work with whatever number your exe returns traditionally 0 for success and larger than 0 for

problem is better solved with a combination of good communication of a system model and favor of the confirmation mechanism speaks the simplicity of from point of view the easiest way of shifting responsibility onto asked you if you really want to shoot yourself into the now there is no one to blame but user point of is a productivity penalty of having to confirm operation twice every time even though actual mistakes take up just a fraction of total number of any switching of breaking the habitual workflow or inserting a pause into confirmation just increases the mechanism really provide much safety net for frequent users whose reflexes work ahead of the concious personally i have many times done a complex sequence of actions only to realise a moment later when observing the consequences that my brain somehow took the wrong better for the but more complex software development point of solution would possible communicate in advance what exact affect the action is going to make on the system instance stack overflow shows message preview above post your answer an immediate feedback to confirm once the action took place highlights the freshly submitted gmail displayes a confirmation when a message is sent to undo or correct possible mistake in so case delete or edit the windows lets restore a file from recycle bin for certain actions still possible to give an undo capability but for a limited timeframe only letting to cancel or change an online order during the first 10 minutes after its or letting to recall an during the first 60 seconds after its been but actually queued in the outbox this is much more initial work than inserting a confimation message but instead of shifting the responsibility it attempts to solve the	
problem is generally a one in terms of computational in fact it rings some bells in the back of my head that it probably reduces to one of those classic algorithm problems like the but i attach a proper name to with such a small problem space can only pick 10 it should be fairly quick to just the when someone submits a custom just recursively attack it with all possibilities and see which one is the take the components and first try to remove the components of from if take the remaining components and try to take the components of from keep track of the best solution found so far as you go still not fast enough i think it probably will depending on how many packages you you could apply some methods to speed it to on the number of possibilities and how long this actually takes to you may want to write the code i described and then just go ahead and all the solutions for every possible then when someone submits a custom you just have to fetch the answer instead of computing it from scratch every if you want to them suggest storing the result every time someone does a custom then in the future if anyone else does the same custom build you have to recalculate the

problem is that you have a route that matches the route values action have two one is the empty string which matches controller action the other is your hash which matches controller action when routing goes to build a url from the route values it find one none of them have the and simplest in this is to create a direct route to the so that you can still use your put this at the top of your registerroutes order routing checks each in the order until it finds a route url with new controller action parameter you have that you really use the default since the value would be consider a valid controller if someone mvc would look for a controller called and complain that it find this means you have to manually add new routes for each new controller action i showed which is a best solution my is to use regex if your hashes have a very format 5 letters followed by 2 or followed by any or if willing to impose such a you can use the regex constraints supported by only need these two new controller action new hash regex route url with new controller action parameter these if mvc sees a controller name it will check the first find that it match the regular and move to the next my regular expression syntax may be a bit so use something like to test a regex to make sure it works with your hashes and controller that i know i wrote a but mvc is so you can do things in so many different

problem with inheritance is that the focus on the language mechanism makes people think about implementation rather than b inherits from it means that every instance of b is also an instance of in being an instance of something means typically that you should have a sensible response to its methods and at least support their you feel that b should not support one of the messages of then as far as i am concerned you have two throw an exception as you would get with the collections this is in my opinion poor accept that b is not a type of a and avoid the or restructure it using composition so that you have to rewrite the code but you do not use a subtyping if your application will live over you want to have semantic issues in your	
processors do a single set of micro instructions per clock these usually involve things like switching a bus into a register or the alu logic the next micro instruction might clock the register or alu to do something with the data on a most assembly level instructions are built up with a series of micro an addition instruction only takes a few micro but dividing may take many most micro controllers document how many cycles each assembly level instruction more sophisticated microcontrollers there is also an instruction pipeline cat which means the processor can start doing part of the next instruction before the previous on has this can become very complicated with concepts like predictive when you simulate digital electronics you use an event based model as electronic systems are but also have propagation delays that need to be i remember using tools like pspice and microsim at uni that did this very

question is a bit as it sounds like you want to get all of the original sequence but then you have both 4 and 8 mapping to and nothing mapping to you actually meant that to be a then what you are looking for is a random permutation of the original there are ways to do this with or without collecting up the set first need something that generates or keep track of where you note that n is not you can always use and then add n to everything if interpreted this correctly and you are actually looking for a shuffle algorithm random called shuffles by analogy to shuffling a deck of have a look at based on your the problem you face is you want to encode the permutation but you must encode it somehow in order to construct the easiest way is just to actually store the permuted indices in an but if you want to do that for some reason too you can encode it in various there is no free lunch as there are information theoretic limits on how simple this can you can get some ideas from looking up work on for example something like

relational database is not your best first choice for want all of your editors to pass changes to your player is effectively a server for all those your player needs multiple open it must listen to all those connections for it must display those the changes are really you can move to a hybrid solution where the editors persist the changes notify the the editors must notify they player that they have a much simpler than the player trying to discover changes in a better design is a server which accepts messages from the persists and notifies the this server is neither editor nor but merely a broker that assures that all the messages are it accepts connections from editors and it manages the are two server is the server is separate from the the design of server change only the when server is the then server calls the player objects when server is separate from the then the server writes to the the player is part of the player objects are invoked directly when a message is received from an when the player is a small reader collects the messages from a socket and calls the player player connects to the server and then waits for a stream of this can either be input from the editors or references to data that the server persisted in the your message traffic is small enough so that network latency is not a editor sends all the data to the if message traffic is too then the editor writes to a database and sends a message with just a database fk to the clarify the editor crashes while the player is permanently messed in your sounds like a poor design for the player it be messed unless not getting state from the various if getting state from the editors attempting to mirror that for then you should consider a design where the player simply gets state from the editor and cannot get messed

results you are getting are consistent with 32bit without knowing more about your not possible to advise what to the code shown is ie not converting anything to strings or then there a fix within outside of the code and depends on the patrick mcdonald and treb brought both up the accuracy of your inputs and the error on i thought take a look at one technique to look at rounding errors is interval which makes the upper and lower bounds which value represents explicit are implicit in floating point and are fixed to the precision of the by treating each value as an upper and lower and by extending the bounds by the error in the representation approx x 2 for a double value x you get a result which gives the lower and upper bounds on the accuracy of a taking into account worst case precision if you have a value in the range and subtract from it a value in the range then the result must lie in the range as the minimum result is and the maximum is and are equivalent to floor and but for the next representable value rather than for intervals which represent double a b c d double precision although is small compared to or it is still large compared to double so if you were using the worst imaginable double precision then you could trust that to be precise to 12 figures lost a few figures off double but still working to more than your if the inputs were only accurate to the number significant then rather than being the double value then the input range would be so you get the a b c d specified accuracy is a much wider you would have to go out of your way to track the accuracy in the and the rounding errors inherent in floating point are not significant in this example precise to 12 figures with the worst case double precision the other if your inputs are only known to 6 it actually matter whether you get or both are within

running a very computationally intensive scientific job that spits out results every now and the job is basically to just simulate the same thing a whole bunch of so divided among several which use different like to direct the output from all these instances to the same since all the computers can see the same filesystem via here are the allow safe concurrent must block if some other instance on another computer is currently appending to the does for each instance is only a few bytes per does the whole point of this pure is so i can stop having every instance write to a different file and manually merging these files not depend on the details of the must work with an unknown filesystem on an nfs or samba language using is in case that nothing in the standard lib that seems to do both and answers are fully acceptable and independent file

same approach is used for the saml web browser sso the primary motivations of using html post redirection are unlimited length of the payload in saml the payload is a xml document signed with xmldsig and base64 it is larger than the usual 1024 characters limitation of url best practice to support not only any browsers but intermediary network devices like reverse load balancer as http standard says that get is idempotent same url get executed multiple times should always result in same and consequently can be cached along the way while post is not and must reach the url response of an openid html form post or saml html form post should not be it must reach the target in order to initiate the authenticated could argue that using a http get redirection would work as well since the url query always change and you would be right is this would be a workaround of the w3c and should not be a standard but an alternate implementation whenever both end agree with

shared functionality back to a framework or library with defined interfaces and default implementations is a common way to handle for your plugin if you choose to support is probably something that could be shared among all of your most of the time the things you want to share are pretty basic functionality or relatively abstract functionality that can be easily the former are easier to recognize and factor out to common the latter may sometimes be more work than simply the code with minor changes patterns rather than thing you want to be careful of is to let the actual drive the design of common libraries rather than coming up with a shared architecture in very tempting to get caught up in framework design and abstracting it out for shared unfortunately you often find that the shared use never develops or develops in a different direction than you expected and you end up rewriting or throwing away much of the framework or even keeping and maintaining unused let yagni gonna need be your guide and delay refactoring to common libraries until you actually have a

solution below assumes that the lower 16 bits of the unicode space will be enough for if your bitmap table say through at positions 0x00 to 0x5e and through at positions 0x5f to 0xbe and through at 0xbf to you could do something like the code below not even contains a series of pairs of the first value in the first pair is the unicode code point which the bitmap at index 0 the assumption is that the bitmap table contains a series of directly adjacent unicode code so the second value says how long this series first part of the while loop iterates through input and builds up a unicode code point in once a complete character is the second part searches for that character in one of the ranges mentioned in if it finds an appropriate bitmap it adds it to characters for which no bitmap is present are silently function returns the number of bitmap indexes way of doing things should be in terms of the reasonably fast and reasonably code below assumes but is about three from assuming an unsigned short is short char unsigned short int int unsigned char unsigned short while if while else if this is invalid do our if if our work here is done no char at this we have a complete char in unsigned short unsigned short while if return you mentioned that you need more than the lower 16 in the above code and it can then do the whole unicode

solution suggested by soulmerge is the and therefore best one you just need to nest the calls to i just want to add that the like will change nothing to the status if the searched string is not therefore you can safely apply it to all and since a condition where you search a string lost in the middle of another string cannot make any use of whatever index you useless as a filtering only filtering condition is the one on brings one point that justifies why solution is iterating on all the changes is a bad suppose that the filter on is moderately odds are that oracle will choose to scan the do you really want to scan the table each time when you can do all the changes in a single

sort algorithm knows nothing about your all it knows about are thus you can sort things that even in a stl so how fast it is going to be depends on the iterators you give and how fast it is to dereference and copy what they point work on since sort requires random access you should use one of member function sorts for that those member functions will efficiently swap around linked list pointers instead of copying

sql from occasionally results in a server is not under much load so the approach used is to lock as much as lock to prevent when multiple instances of an application calls this begin transaction check that no one has inserted the rows in t1 before and that t2 is in a valid state if not exists top 1 1 from t1 where fkid in and not top 1 1 from t2 where dbid in and test1 is not im the first go insert the row in t1 and update t2 finally write a log to t3 insert into select from t2 where dbid in update t2 set lastchangedby lastchangedat where dbid in insert into t3 select from t2 where dbid in select status on the rows so the program can evaluate what just select status from t1 where fkid in commit believe the problem is that multiple tables needs to be a bit unsure when the tables are actually xlocked when a table is used the first time or are all tables locked at one time at begin transaction when are table actually

standard way to define the assignment constructor correctly so that it is exception safe is to define it in terms of the copy if doctor use copy constructor now return void swap each member doing it like this makes it exception you just need to make the swap a this is relatively simple if you are using stl objects as they all define a swap just for this situation as does boost and all good libraries you should follow this going wrong they will go wrong in using the copy at this point you have not modified your own object as you are copy constructing into a thus you are providing good exception safety as your object is still

static methods can for example operate on private static members of their this can be utilized to encapsulate and unify certain class specific major drawback of using static methods is in my opinion the fact that one throws away the possibility to since classes in java are not classes in you can not override static your question relates to private static overriding is out of option tend to use static methods only in case of utility classes or patterns like the singleton all of these require a higher visibility than because they represent services provided by their class to if you have one or more private static think about extracting them to a dedicated utility class and making them even make them instance methods and use the singleton

still not sure that following what you it sounds like you want a function i o the inputs are a strongly random distribution sequence of symbols on an alphabet a series of random natural numbers the outputs are another sequence on and you want that sequence to have as much entropy as the if got this first if you if then lg lg so the entropy of the set of output symbols is then you can do it trivially by just selecting the element of entropy will be the since the number of possible output symbols is the they going to be in the sense of being uniformly distributed over the whole set because necessarily some symbols be selected at on the other be satisfied with having a random sequence on then you can do it by selecting an appropriate pseudorandom number generator using your input from the random source as a

there absolutely are situations where it is better to not catch an an exception can sometimes tell you that your program is in an unknown there are a number of exceptions where this is pretty much intrinsically true given the exception a essentially tells you is a and by catching such an you may hide the which sounds good in the short but in the long term be happier to fix the product may not but it certainly have the expected this is also true for exception types we invent for the fact that exception a has been thrown should be and yet it has so a something very important happens when you catch an the blocks for the whole call stack inside the try block anything it will be what do those finally blocks and if the program is in an unknown i really do mean they could erase valuable customer data from the they could throw more they could corrupt data in making the bug impossible to when an exception indicates an unknown you want to run any more so whatever you catch the let it fly and your program will terminate and windows error reporting will be able to capture the state of the program as it was when the problem was originally if you catch the you will cause more code to which will screw up the state of the program should you throw an exception knowing it be i think that question misunderstands the nature of reusable the whole idea of a method is that it has a that it it accepts certain parameters and returns a certain plus also it throws certain exceptions under certain the contract up to the caller what they do with for some exception a might indicate a recoverable for other it might indicate a and from what i said it should be clear that if an exception indicates a must not be if wondering what this means for the enterprise exception handling pretty they tell you to and then decide whether to rethrow based on your too late the blocks have already executed by that do

these considered globally option is globally 1 this is only unique if you can guarantee no more than one id is generated per from your it does not sound like this would 2 random numbers are pseudo but not guaranteed to be with that already in we can reduce the datetime portion of this option to a similar problem to option you want a globally unique id that is an one good way would be a synchronous service of some sort that returns sequential i guess it depends on what your definition of global if you had larger than an int32 to work and you mean global on a given then maybe you could use ip address with a sequence number where the sequence number is generated synchronously across you have other unique identifiers besides ip then that would obviously be a better choice for displaying as part of a

thing you can try is taking the fft of your 1d line and then removing later for in matlab i did the truncate to 250 tended to happen was that the peaks of the ifft of f were very close to peaks of they necessarily the highest points of but they were for this there were peaks at and 725 in the inverted fft of and there were also peaks in y at and global max was at which was a peak in but not a very high this only really cuts your data usage in because i converted 1000 doubles into 250 complex a further increase can be obtained by only using the real part of the only uses the space still yielded pretty good with each major peak of corresponding to a peak in y that was only at most a distance of 2 away most of the and you use the space of storing the double this still get you the results of or two double you are now packing 2500 doubles into you can experiment by cutting more but you will have to test more values by cutting more maybe you can keep the first of and find the and then look within a distance of 3 or this would reduce your 2500 doubles to a only testing will find out what works best for your you can go as low as the lowest and search 5 or 6 in either direction for the true but this still leaves you with 25 think any way to convert 2500 doubles into only 1 or and have it reversible into anything take a look at information theory texts to see suggest you get gnu or even and play around with something like this and find what results are best for	
think a right or wrong answer so give you my either solution the account controller or creating a new will work just i think this is more a question of how the users perceive the i think a good idea to follow the convention that the uri dictates the controller vice if you for like to have the actions on a separate then that should be a separate you might want to do for if you use an iis module for authentication or if it makes your log analysis the other it might be the case that the users perceive account functions and administrative functions as part of the same family of except that some users have additional if then that suggests that should be on the same path in the uri part of the same i think this is a question you should ask your user representative instead of folks on this regarding your updated i would say that it is fairly natural to put an action for changing a password on the account and that action could be invoked by the user not just an so i presume that the account controller is strictly for administrative on the other your example of the performance is well outside of the scope of so it is not clear that it belongs on still leaning your user	
think already done the thin controller thing by putting the query into a named scope where it can be here is some code i used before i started using named def describe to get it expose all comms as get would probably write code quite similar to what you have but maybe put it in a helper that allows me to reuse the other thing is to use a different mocking framework that maybe gives you more have a look at ryan railscast on rspec a bit old now but still some good ideas in

think enums were made this way as opposed to what you want to meant to hold any meaningful numerical enums are perfect for describing the else in color can be represented by complex types but indulge me for the how about think you get the bottomline enumerations were meant to represent objects or object characteristics that are difficult to represent or do not have meaningful or practical numerical representations and thus the arbitrary assignment to an integer which is the most convenient data type for is as opposed to things like which are

think going to be better off randomly picking from a list of pregenerated colors that meet your requirements different enough from each than trying to generate colors on the to far as keeping more than one user from having the same one thing seen systems do is to just assign colors locally on the users machine using usually not that important that different users see the same colors for other i care if the colors on my screen are the same as they are on some other as long as all the colors on my screen are in fact it may be desirable for each own text to be distinct is everyone is for	
think got the most important bits you more metadata i know the details of what is emitted by a c or but i suspect more names and similar information are included in just look at what the decompiler knows about in a particular stack for example as far as the x86 is you only know how the stack is in il you know what the contents of the stack at the type not the semantic as already il is a higher level abstraction than x86 has no idea what a method or function call or an or a property il has all that information still within c and compilers optimise much more heavily than the this is because the compiler assumes that most of the optimisation can still be performed later by the in some ways it makes sense for the compiler to try to do much as there are various bits of information which are available to the jit but not the optimised code is harder to because further away from being a natural representation of the original source was designed to be x86 was designed to be executed natively via the information the jit compiler needs is similar to that that a decompiler would so a decompiler has an easier time with in some ways this is really just a restatement of the second	
think i just found as konrad rudolph they use this convention because of a technical means it cannot duplicate the name of an instance a temporary variable defined in the or another temporary smalltalk a local method variable cannot be named the same as an coming from i assumed a variables would be locally and access the instance variables using something still need to learn more about the scoping in but it appears they have no other they use a different variable name than the instance so is probably the simplest using just results is already defined you have an instance variable defined	
think in your uiimage should handle this app and give good the issue looks to be that you are forcing the whole screen to redraw in response to every the rect that is passed in specifies the that you need to any other drawing is just wasting the rect you pass to your is the rect you specifically want to calculate a rect around the touch and invaliate uikit will union mutiple dirty rects and send a single would suggest you perform the following the dirty rect passed to your the and if it is less than the full screen write code to make sure you only repaint images within the dirty the touches event to make sure you only invalidate the areas that need redrawing and then revisit this get the performance you use quartz to draw the black and white rects rather than using images incase it is some uiimage weirdness i doubt this is the you need to display bitmaps and 1 2 get the performance you you will have to resort to lower level there are lots of examples around including on

think it is worth knowing and there are reasons to choose close to the whole stack is sometimes you need to debug sometimes you cannot fix a performance problem without knowledge is often the when the performance problem is purely but it is widely considered the quintessential of the and not some other i think this because c is a programming it has been a while but c was not always as to take just one famous the proponents of common lisp had its own ways of writing were hoping their language would be and eventually following are usually implemented in systems many embedded operating programming languages popular implementations of reams of popular open source not a hardware but i gather that c has influenced cpu design if you believe in understanding the whole learning c from a pragmatic the best a i think worth learning as although c is close to the i fully understand c until i had to do some it is occasionally helpful to understand how functions calls are actually how loops are less but also is having to least deal with a system without virtual when using c on and certain other operating even humble does a lot of work under the covers that is easier to debug tune if ever had to deal with manually locking and unlocking memory regions that i would recommend doing so on a regular

think one issue is the number of choices design of everyday says that usability is increased by having few and clear choices limiting the choices a specification increases usability for the envisioned task and but this necessarily decreases flexibility in i think doet a little with the example a push the door already one the idea of an affordance is to make it clear which way it the limitation comes first and the clarity comes the limitation has more to do with and because each time the door opens we anticipate where it swings and security because it can be reinforced in a chosen direction for barring really think we limit choices so that we know how do open a because we make them swing if we thus once the limits have been established that the push plate makes it clear what you have to do on your side of the

think setting the directly is treated by the browser the same as it would treat the user directly entering a new url into the location this means that no referrer since referrers are about one page directly referring to via a not the browser just going to another way i can see to solve your issue is to make sure your drop down list is in a form that posts to then make your javascript submit the form like then just need to change your setdefault action in your controller to have a playercharacters parameter so that the mvc will bind the request value to your method

think the big issue here is that creating an inner class of the surrounding the list you create will have an implicit reference to the outer normally a if you serialise this object thinking particularly of using since run into this then the serialised form will contain the serialised outer which at all what normally expect and can result in peculiar use the above initialisation pattern a so long as aware of the inner class mechanism then not a i think the equality issue is an issue beyond that of equality implementations on derivations in

this i found it on one of the answers in so type you can also try searching so and googling for types vs value for differences between structs and restricts a struct from acting like a are many you cannot inherit from a for have virtual so you cannot use a struct to implement an instance methods in structs can access private but apart from that they behave a lot like auxilirary functions immutable they sometimes even need to access private so i find them to be not as near as as class	
this i should be notified where is may not have understood you i see what refers for and i can only guess at the relationship between b and do you mean that b is derived from 4 will not necessarily make such a thing happen the types and are not compatible at all by if is an and the type parameter is marked as then can be assigned to a variable of type but note that this is for interfaces not concrete types is a similar provision for but therefore what you want to do is simulate the way that can be assigned to a variable of type in where x is an x t t may only appear as an so this is void have an you need an you know that is assignable to so you need the following public impl public a return just forward each method on to the real you would need such a wrapper class for every possible combination of generic outer classes and pairs of generic parameters related by it would be a and task to write them all by hand and maintain a big lookup to pick the right one for a given now into code generation to manufacture the wrapper classes at

this is a tdbgrid have a generic event and the position of your button makes it difficult to fake the only thing i can think of is to create your own this as difficult as it might sound at descend from tdbgrid and override the mouseup take a look at the way is i tested but you could probably try something like after the if statement that tests fires off click have it fire or something if then attach an event handler to your ontitleclick event that calls if column sort of a but i think of an easier way to do if i were you report this one to qc as a	
this is about general practices start from rules of the use use xml with a library to read write the xml file you must use do it properly and use a free library to parse and store the csv justify most csv parsers encoding aware so if you dealing with you are asking for example excel 2002 is storing the csv in local encoding without any note about the the csv standard widely adopted the other hand xml standard is well adopted and it handles encodings pretty justify there is tons of csv parsers around for almost all language so there is no need to reinvent the wheel even if the solutions looks pretty name python use build in perl check cpan and php use build in java check there is no need to implement this by hand if you going to parse it on embedded

this is not a conflict on the theoretical level but a conflict on an implementation problem is not having domain models as versus more complex object map where order has orderitems and some calculatetotal the specific problem is for that order needs to grab the latest wholesale prices of the orderitem from some web service in china so you have some spring service running that allows calls to this pricequery service in order has calculatetotal which iterates over every gets the latest and adds it to the how would you ensure that every order has a reference to this pricequery how would you restore it upon loading from and fresh this is my exact easy way would be to pass a reference to the calculatetotal but what if your object uses this service internally throughout its what if used in 10 it gets messy to pass references around every way would be to move calculatetotal out of the order and into the but that breaks oo design and we move towards the old way of domain objects require references to many but these objects get persisted or so any references they hold to outside components beans in this are transient and get wiped they need to be when the object is or loaded from the but this is extremely ugly and i see an elegant way to do a while now practiced loose coupling and di with the help of helped me a lot in keeping things manageable and a while i read design and some martin as a been trying to convert my domain models from simple dtos simple representations of a table just data no into a more rich domain my domain grows and takes on new my domain objects are starting to require some of the beans that i have in my spring this has quickly become a nightmare and one of the most difficult parts of converting to a rich domain there are points where i am manually injecting a reference to the application context into my object is loaded from repository or other responsible entity since the component references are transient and obviously get object is created from factory since a newly created object lacks the component object is in a quartz job or some other place since the transient component references get ugly because passing the object an application context reference and expecting it to pull out by name references to the components it this direct ugly code because in all of those mentioned places i need logic for injecting an error prone because i have to remember to inject in all those places for all those which is harder than it has got to be a better way and hoping you can shed some light on can i resolve the conflict between loose injection and a rich domain

this type of probably use string in be the best way to do this probably depends partly on why you have to define before a string repeated a and you wanted to put it in a global variable or printf would be my or putting it in a function as other answers have the string is only used once or are you sure you refactor the code to make be defined before a bit of bland you write immediately takes the value of and puts it into the after it worried about for purposes of and even if because it contains a literal copy of the as far as a way of binding a position in a string to a the method leaves placeholders in the which the function printf replaces with values when you decide what should go in the if you wanted to only not have to call another get no way to do the closest method would be using placeholders and but that requires an explicit call to a not an implicit

use wordpress as a where the front page is static for the most part and the actual blog part of it has been moved to a new page that uses a custom page template that basically acts as if it were the front page on a standard wordpress it works pretty well but it still has a few the main one is that pagination will no longer wordpress recognize the page urls that are far configured wordpress to display the correct urls instead of and also gotten it to display a specific page of blog posts via a url parameter so basically almost i just need to map to this would be an easy task if it were just a plain old static but wordpress has own url handling that i believe may be interfering with it not to mention an actual url so it needs to go through the rules once for mapping the blog and once again so wordpress can handle the generated url as it would i think i may need to use the n or ns flags for the rewrite rules but i just know how i would use rule come up wordpress on per some gotten this for the but it still recognize fairly certain changing the page via the url parameter does work i change the number in the url manually and it does in fact change the the web server is if that makes any

used to be in the question would be very useful is a non trivial example of an app which uses events it really helps testing so far use events or publish number of classes can be notified when an event is subscribing classes do not need to know how the metronome code and the metronome does not need to know what they are going to do in response to the publisher and the subscribers are decoupled by the this is highly desirable as it makes for more flexible and robust the metronome can change how it detects time without breaking any of the subscribing the subscribing classes can change how they respond to time changes without breaking the the two classes spin independently of one which makes for code that is easier to static void setup the metronome and make sure the eventhandler delegate is metronome metronome new wires up the method to the eventhandler listener listener new listenerb listenerb new class a so every time tick is the runtime calls another in this case and public event eventhandler virtual so can override default behaviour in inherited classes protected virtual void null guard so if there are no listeners attached it wont throw an if public void while because using eventhandler need to include the sending object and eventargs although we are not using class public new private void eventargs class public new private void eventargs heard article writing on my some of this text is from

uses the allocator that was given to it as the second template like this say it is in let be the object to be size is never greater than t copy construct items over from old destruct old dtors are not allowed to throw if they behavior is undefined set new after everything worked out else size less than tell the allocator to allocate an object at the memory place previously we have one more item in like the allocator will care about allocating it keeps the steps of allocating memory and constructing object into that memory so it can preallocate but not yet call during the vector has to take care about exceptions being thrown by copy which complicates the matter the above is just some pseudo code snippet not real code and probably contains many if the size gets above the it asks the allocator to allocate a new greater block of if not then it just constructs at the previously allocated exact semantics of this depend on the if it is the standard construct will known as the allocate will just get memory from would call the that is abstracted behind the allocator and the vector just uses a stack or pooling allocator could work completely some key points about that are a call to you can have up to n items inserted into your vector without risking a until that is as long as references and iterators to elements of it remain storage is you can treat as a buffer containing as many elements you have currently in your

volatile keyword should not confused as to making and see for a better the manualresetevent does not have any bearing on the of and you have to manage that with this i am attempting to distill all of the information that has been put in various answers and comments regarding this basic question is whether or not the result variables and will be at the time the flag variable returns a assume that none of the variables are marked in this it would be possible for the result variables to be set the flag variable is set in like private void possibly work goes is clearly not what we so how do we deal with these variables are marked then this reordering will be but that is what prompted the original question the volatiles required or does the manualresetevent provide an implicit memory barrier such that reordering does not in which case the volatile keyword is not really i understand position is that the function provides an implicit memory barrier which fixes the that seem sufficient to the main and background threads be executing on two separate if does not also provide an implicit memory then the function could end up being executed like this on one of the processors with the volatile private void possibly work goes have searched high and low for information regarding memory barriers and the and i have come up with the only reference i have seen is the one wekempf has made to jeffrey the problem i have with this is that the eventwaithandle is meant to synchronize not access to i have never seen any example where eventwaithandle is used to synchronize access to as to believe that eventwaithandle does anything with regard to memory i would expect to find reference to this on the this is a response to response to my managed to read the section from jeffrey book at from page 628 quotes this i should point out that whenever a thread calls an interlocked the cpu forces cache so if you are manipulating variables via interlocked you do not have to worry about all of this memory model all thread synchronization locks call interlocked methods it would seem as wekempf pointed that the result variables do require the volatile keyword in the example as shown since the manualresetevent ensures cache closing this there are two additional points like to my initial assumption

want a combination of a minidump drwatson to create these if you want to add your own generation and userdump to trigger a minidump creation on a thing about automatically detecting a hang is that its difficult to decide when somethings hung and when its just slow or blocked by io i personally prefer to allow the user to crash the app deliberately when they think its apart from being a lot easier apps tend to hang if at all it also helps them to part of the they like check out the classic concerning crashdumps and which also has some excellent information regarding going on with these get which allows you to create the and for setting it up to generate you have the open it in and you will be able to inspect the entire program state including threads and memory and parameters to i think be particularly interested in using the command in windbg to get the callstack of every and the command to show all locking i think find that the hang will be due to a deadlock of synchronisation which will be difficult to track down as all threads tend to wait on a waitforsingleobject but look further down the callstacks to see the application threads than threads like background notifications and network once narrowed them you can see what calls were being possibly add some logging instrumentation to the app to try and give you more information ready for the next time it quick google reminded me of is the command line equivalent of

you want to do this sort of as infrequently as because no particularly efficient way to do you specify what sort of data your site has on but going to assume something like a or a going to talk about this sort of functionality as it would be done for a but a similar approach would work for a you only want to be doing the when a page is changed submitted in the first note that there are two different ways that links have to be when a page is created or you need to search that text to determine what links should be in whenever any page is or you need to addition to the search of this page in the case of search all other pages to links as there are a few options for how to store these option is to keep two of every text in the one version is the original this is what you actually and what will be displayed if you choose to edit the the second version is the this is the data that is used to display the page to normal if your wiki markup for bold is the has and the has this makes it so that you have to process your markup on every page approach is applied to by doing a search through the submitted text to find words that should be and putting those links into the for when a page is you would step through every word in the text and compare it against a list of sure you have this list you want to be doing a database query for every this can be made fairly efficient by storing the potential linkwords as keys into a if the word being tested is in the you put a link to the relevant page around the word when you copy it into the if you just put the word exactly as it was in the are a few other options about how to implement but a fairly straightforward leave you with that for but if like to me to describe any of the other let me know in a comment and edit it

you want to merge most but not all of the commits on branch to for you can do it requires some as mentioned the usual use case is to merge everything from a but sometimes it happens that you made a change to a release version that be integrated back that been superceded in master so how do you represent here suppose maint has had 5 changes and one of those is not to be merged back into although all the others should you do this in three actually merge everything before that tell git to mark as merged even when it and then merge the the magic git merge git merge ours git merge first command merges everything your troublesome maint commit onto the default merge log message will explain merging second command merges the troublesome but the option tells git to use a special in works by simply keeping the tree you are merging into and ignoring the you are merging but it does still make a new merge commit with head and as the so the revision graph now says that is so in fact you probably want to use the option to as to explain that that commit is actually being final command simply merges the rest of maint into master so that all synced up
